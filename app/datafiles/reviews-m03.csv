Get these if you're a pro or even semi-pro artist (I'm not!) or if you need some light coloring in your drawings.

The pencil are incredibly sturdy and they sharpen cleanly. have yet to find watercolor pencils that can compare to Caran D' Ache's quality. The pigment is very strong especially when water is applied. There is more than one way to combine water with these pencils and you'll even get a short guide on different ways you can add water to your artwork. I gave away the first set I owed and the new owner of the set is amazed how easily these pencils glide. The colors aren't muddy or grainy when wet. You can use a portable watercolor brush, a regular brush dipped in water or dip the pencil in water before applying it to a page. Sometimes I don't even use water in my artwork because the color is strong enough to pop off the page without it. I am very happy with my purchase and shipping was very quick.

The colors span the entire spectrum. They lay down smoothly even on canvas paper and acrylic textured paper. They really do, as one reviewer noted, erase, cleanly completely ( except for a shadow of a heavy hand with an intense dark). There's an inexpensive wooden box with three drawers, you know the one, usually warped and not too stable? If you ease the dividers out of those drawers, a complete layer, tin tray and all will fit into the drawer . Trimming the  plastic tray into the appropriate widths allows safe placement of the third drawer (the bottom tin is too deep to fit into the drawers.

Placing them in drawers saves the pencils because they won't rub together in their plastic trays, held by the tin ones, and you don't have to  keep pulling the trays out of a box to access the shade you need.

B0018N9P22,5.0,I like this glue due to its strong hold and quick setup. I don't like the hair fine strings when you pull away to tip of the glue gun.

B0018N9P22,4.0,"IDK how much I can say about glue sticks, but I'll try.

Firstly, compared to those little 4"" mini things you get at the dollar store and use for the dollar store glue gun - night and day. These are far superior in all the ways. Except. There WAS stringing, which got this bumped down a star.

But in all the other ways? This stuff was SO much better. NO odor (which is amazing coming from me, I am chemically sensitive and can smell EVERYTHING). When this burn glue got hot, it got HOT, and basically could melt ANYTHING - so I quickly learned to be careful with my glue gun.

Word to the wise - this same package can be gotten in the store of the evil W for less than half the price, which I learned when I ran out. I don't generally shop there (because of the evil), but it was an emergency and it was the only place I KNEW we could get them, and yeah. (I was making my son's hHalloween costume, which was Freddy Fazbear - I needed LOTS of burn glue). Sorry, Amazon, I'm usually loyal, but dang.

B0018N9P22,5.0,"If you have a Leaky Plastic Kayak, Hot Glue can be used to repair the crack.

I believe Plastic Kayaks are Polypropylene. (same as auto bumpers) The pros fix those with Plastic Welders.  This likewise works by using Heat to melt the parts together.

Crack was 4"" long.  I cannot reach the crack from the inside, so this repair was carried out from the outside.

I drilled a 3/16"" hole at each end (to spread the load), then beveled the edges of both holes.  I opened the crack at the bottom to about 1/16"" end to end. Then, I beveled both edges of the crack to a sharp edge.  The bevel left the Plastic at the bottom of the crack very thin, which the Glue melted as it was applied.

I preheated the crack, let the Glue Gun get really hot, then jammed in the glue!

You'll only have one shot at this, unless you want to prep it again, so be sure your Glue Gun puts out a LOT of Glue that's REALLY HOT.  I doubt that those tiny glue guns get hot enough.

B0018N9P22,5.0,I purchase the 10 pack of these along with my Ad-Tech Dual-temp gun and I love how quickly they bond and dried up. My old glue gun used mini glue sticks and I was constantly having to add a new one as it was used up so quickly. These lasted so much longer since they are like the length of two glue sticks combined. When it dried it's semi-clear in color that you might be able to use them for Faux Resin charms. Overall I know they'll last awhile and I'll be using these always.,MUST-HAVE if you have an Ad-Tech Glue Gun !,False,

B001DHVQQ6,5.0,"This was my first multi-color large project.  I read a bit and did a couple small free hand projects before this to acquaint myself with the stitches and how too's of crosstitch.  I fell in love with this project very soon after I started it. I spent about 250 hours enjoying this project.  It has vibrant colors which made it easy to follow the pattern.  Many of the colors happen to match the colors of my new grand baby's bedroom.  Dimensions makes it much easier than other companies by providing separated (by number) color bundles, a clear, crisp, and easy to read graph and instructions. To make it easier to find and pick the right color, I drew a picture of the color above the number on the thread bar.  Follow the instructions and you can't go wrong to achieve a beautiful end product.  I opted for a different stitch pattern and colorization for the personalization but the pattern gave plenty of room to do such.  I also bought some white thread to fill in areas inside each car that would otherwise have been without thread.  It gave it that complete look by having everything inside each car stitched.  This is a beautiful project for the beginner to advance stitcher.  I sometimes spent 10 hours straight stitching without any eye or finger fatigue.  It was a delight to watch it progress.  My wife would take pictures as it progressed.  It was truly an enjoyable experience to stitch this project.
  I have since done a wedding announcement by a different company. Their product, instructions, graph ,etc. don't compare with Dimensions.  I worked on this project for over 5 months and many times wished I had never picked it.  It was extremely frustrating, even with using the color bar from Dimensions to separate the colors into bundles.  I have vowed to only do Dimension products in the future to ensure an enjoyable experience. My next project is soon to start.  Hope you enjoy this project as much as I did!!!","An exciting,beautiful & challenging crosstitch",False,11

B001H7HA80,3.0,"Yes it works...but, it's quite a project to get a bunch of flowers dried which is what I was trying to do.  The 'blue crystals' turned white often which meant I had to remove the flowers from the crystals, shake the crystals onto a cookie sheet, and bake the whole mess for 5-6 hours to get them blue again.  I had to 'bake' the crystals three times to get my flowers fairly dried--I should have done it one more time but was just tired of digging out the flowers and waiting for 5 hours to pass.  The flowers had color when dried--which was one of the main reasons I tried this method.  However, the colors were NOT the same colors the fresh flowers were when we started the process!  IF you want to do a bouquet (wedding or other), I would highly recommend buying at least 3-6 boxes of this product so you don't have to keep baking and redrying time after time.",Buy in major bulk if you plan to do a bouquet,True,10
B001H7HA80,5.0,"I have to say I was a little skeptical about this stuff. I gave it a go and I am quite impressed. My flowers have dried exactly how I put them in the containers and didn't wilt like they normally do by doing the old fashioned hanging them upside down method.

I will say, they are just as fragile as a normally dried upside down flower. . I discovered a few ways to fix that, like dipping them in wax or putting a coat of resin over them. There are really a lot of things to do with them once they dry so check Youtube and Pinterest for some cool ideas.

However, the only 'downside' is that it's difficult to dry the flower with the stem and all its glory since you have to cover the entire flower with the gel. You ultimately need to trim them down to just a small stemmed flower. . which makes it difficult to arrange them in a vase later on. The best solution I found (without buying 100 pounds of this stuff to cover an entire bouquet including the stems) is to cut them down, dry them, and then buy the artificial stems. I'm new at this so there may be better alternatives out there, but the gel itself works amazingly well.",Works GREAT,True,5

Then, you know when to recharge the silica gel.  The one downside that is easily remedied is that it comes in a plastic bag, with twist tie in a cardboard box.

B001LXKNUC,4.0,"I've used Stitch Witchery for years, both for art projects and for regular sewing needs. Aside from crafting, I use this to attach badges/patches, shorten curtains, and fix hems in clothing. This is something that should be in every college student's ""sewing kit"" (along with safety pins!)---this stuff can be a lifesaver for people who aren't comfortable with needle and thread.

I get the best results with this when I use a very hot iron on the steam setting. I've also used a damp cloth between the iron and the clothing I am fusing. Stitch Witchery will start to fuse pretty quickly, but don't stop pressing at that point! If you want to get a good seal that will last through the laundry cycle, you have to really heat (melt) this product completely---definitely use a cloth as a buffer if you fear scorching your fabric. Alternatively, if you need to make a very temporary emergency repair, just barely heat it until it sticks and you will probably be able to ""peel apart"" the fabric later if you need to.

My one star off is just because Stitch Witchery seems to make fabric a little less flexible.  Depending on what you are hemming this might not matter, but on flowy skirts and dresses I don't like the slight stiffness (it improves a little after washing). On curtains, tablecloths, or crafts, no problem.","Convenient, even if you know how to sew",True,6

B005E0HXY2,5.0,These little gizmos are a jewelry crafters best friend!! Let me tell you! I stumbled upon these a couple years back and since then have been adding them to my jewelry making because they really do protect the jewelry from wear and tear. The part that would normally get a lot of wear and I have noticed they break often is at the loop. I also believe these give my jewelry that truly finished look. It really does complete the piece and I am always wearing my designs to test them for durability. I wear them 24/7 to see how long they will last. I am tough on jewelry and for me to get 6-8 months of wear on a bracelet or necklace is pretty amazing. I use this with the 19-49 strand tiger tail in the beadalon brand. If you have yet to try these I'd say you have nothing to lose and everything to gain so give them a try. I promise you won't regret this purchase!

I love how easy it is to work with but I do have trouble getting it hot enough for my scented oil and colored chips to blend properly. I believe that's due to my equipment and not the wax because I was using a Pyrex bowl in a pot as a double boiler before this year.

B00B2CECEU,5.0,"I was a die-hard (45 years) Susan Bates Quicksilver & anodized hooks user.  Don't even try to convince me anything was better.  Eating my words!  These Clover hooks are silky-smooth; the yarn glides right off.  They don't split the yarn like Bates, and even though they are not the ""inline"" throat, the throats are not as narrowed as Boye, so they are more like inline - helping to keep tension consistent.  I hold hooks like a knife or shovel (not like a pencil) and they are very comfortable to use for long times (don't know why they wouldn't be equally as comfortable for ""pencil holders"" but of course can't say from experience).

An oddity for Americans - does not contain a size K hook, but does contain a 4.5 mm (#7 - between the G and H) hook (not included in American made sets).
You may want to do what I did and just buy one hook before you buy the set.  That convinced me!",These are the ones.,True,2.0
B00B2CECEU,5.0,"I would say I'm an intermediate crocheter and before buying these I was using Susan Bates hooks. When I first started, I learned with the Boye hooks but kept struggling until I bought Susan Bates. While I love my Susan Bates hooks, they snag alot. I decided to treat myself and see if these lived up to the hype and I have to say YES. I couldn't believe the difference.
Pros: These hooks are so smooth and glide through the yarn so easily and I haven't had any problems with snagging. The handle is soft and comfortable, I use the knife hold. I used to have to take lots of breaks because my hands would cramp but with these hooks I find myself lasting longer. They're also very lightweight.

Cons: My only issue is I wish the hook was a little deeper, its more shallow than my other hooks, but it hasn't been too big of a problem.

The case: I like having a case to organize my hooks. I agree with other reviewers that I wish the holders were a little deeper to hold the hooks better but it does the job and with the black flap on top of the hooks, its not too bad. I'm not one of those people who can just throw all their hooks into a single case together because I hate rummaging through them so I appreciate the individual slots and for only $7 more than if you were to buy the hooks by themselves its totally worth it.",Lives up to the hype,True,
B00B2CECEU,5.0,"Very nice, case is especially nice. Like the soft handles on the hook.",Good!,True,
B00B2CECEU,5.0,I haven't used them to crochet a whole piece yet but I played with them for a bit.  The yarn moves along the aluminum really easily and the grips feel so good in my hand.  Before these I had the Susan Bates hooks and my hand would start to cramp if I was crocheting too long.  I'm really an avid knitter now but I'm looking forward to my next crochet project so I can bust these bad boys out!,Feel comfy in my grip!,True,
B00B2CECEU,5.0,"Beautiful hook set.  Love the colorful case and hook handles.  I have not had the hooks fall out of the holders, but they could have been a little deeper.  After reading the other reviews, I appreciated the notations that the items shown in the photo do not come with this set.  These Clover hooks are beautifully made, no rough spots or mal-formed heads that I have seen in some other brands.  They are really comfortable to use.

B00B2CECEU,5.0,Very nicely packaged.  Hooks are smooth and clean.  I give them a 4 star only because I wish they were a little longer.  I love that they are marked with both the letter and mm sizes.

B00B2CECEU,5.0,This is my 2nd set of these hooks. I love using them because the handles are so comfortable and they have the right style hook.,Best hooks available,True,
B00B2CECEU,5.0,"I love it! I wasn't sure it would be worth the price, but I've been using these hooks constantly since I got them, and it's been very easygoing on both of my hands. Not sure how it's relaxing my yarn-hand, but it is. I guess I don't have to tense up as much, since the hooks make it easy to keep consistent stitches, and they can't slide down the handle. Plus.. Those pretty colors!

The case is nice and sturdy too. The pocket is pretty flat, but the zippers work well. Overall, I'm glad I bought this set instead of just the hooks, although this doesn't include the small accessories in the picture. It is just the 10 hooks, and the case.

B00B2CECEU,5.0,"I had been crocheting really intensely for a few hours a day when I started my business. I was using this cheap metal hook from Walmart. My hands were bruising and callousing and blistering and my fingers were shredding. Then I bought these. I love them. I haven't had an ache since. I take it everywhere, even when I forget to bring yarn with me, its ridiculous. I put a Clover Chibi needle case, a pocket of stitch markers, and a 5"" pair of scissors. Its a little tight, but thats all that I need usually. Clover even made a new line of much smaller hooks that will fit in this case (and match) too! Buy this. It's the best thing that ever happened to my crocheting.",This is probably one of my favorite things in the world.,True,13.0

B00B2CECEU,5.0,"Nice and comfortable in the hand. I love the variety of colored handles which also state clearly the letter size and mm number. The hooks glide with ease through work.

B00B2CECEU,4.0,"Well, I am new to crocheting and decided to give this set a try since the reviews were so good. I have to say that this is an amazing set. The only negative thing is that I wish that it came with bigger hooks though. That's the only reason why I gave it 4 stars. When you pay that much for something, it would be nice to be done buying hooks. I'll have to see if they sell the larger hooks separately.",Smooth as silk,True,

B00B2CECEU,5.0,"I'll admit, I haven't been using them very much since I got them, but I love them so far (work is getting in the way of crocheting, as it tends to do). The smaller hook length takes some getting used to, but it didn't take long for it to become second nature as always. I've only worked on my current projects a little bit with these new hooks, so I can't necessarily say if they're similar to other sizes, but I played with a spare skein for a while after I opened this package and kept exclaiming how awesome these hooks are.",Great hooks,True,
B00B2CECEU,5.0,"These are great hooks. Not wild about the color of the case but at least I won't lose it very easily <g>.  My big complaint is that the size is embossed in the hook handle and hard to read - I wish they would have also colored the letters and numbers. But problem solved with the use of an extra-fine Sharpy marker - the tip was just the right size to fit in the ""groove"" of the letters and numbers and now I can read them.",Good for arthritis,True,

B00B2CECEU,5.0,I really do like these hooks.  I have a really hard time with my hands getting cold and using all metal hooks added to the problem.  It had gotten to the point where I could only crochet for 10-15 minutes at a time during the winter.  I tried bamboo and even paid for a Furls crochet hook but didn't really like either of them.  I just really like using metal hooks.  I  like how the handles on these are still mostly rounded.  The other clover ones handles flat and didn't feel right to me.  So far they have been the best I have tried.  I do think they are over priced for what they are but they have solved my problem.  So happy I found these.  I also have to say the picture that they show with all the extras is misleading.  You get the 10 hooks and the case.  That is it.  I don't think Amazon should be showing pictures that make it look like extras are included when they are not.,My favorite set of hooks,True,21.0

B00DURLH1Q,3.0,"The outer die in this set (and don't get me wrong...the set is lovely in theory) doesn't cut, except for the minute detail at the top and bottom, which is a very tiny lattice pattern, and the center. The rest of that particular die just impresses into your paper, and it better be very THIN paper. I had no luck at all using the Grand Calibur machine and had to resort to the Big Shot. Even in the Big Shot, (with shim) it wouldn't cut through cardstock.
I'm not a novice at die cutting, but this set really had me stumped. The second largest die has no cutting edge, either, so in order to cut it out, you need to nest it inside the largest die. I tried using my Spellbinders magnetic sheet to line up the two dies to run through the Grand Calibur, but it was very tight and wouldn't go through and I had to back the sandwich out. I've broken too many Grand Calibur machines in the years I've been die cutting. I guess you could use the cut out piece from the center of the largest die and cut the second die from that, but this is already getting a little complicated.
Spellbinders seems to be doing a lot of this intricate stuff lately, and I wouldn't mind it so much if the dies would just CUT in their own die cutting machine. Yeah, I tried waxed paper, I tried removing the magnetic sheet and taping the two dies down, then turning them and running through repeatedly...they just don't cut in the Grand Calibur. While I love their fancy dies, it would be nice if they'd redesign the Grand Calibur so that it actually does something useful. And completely off the subject, is the name of this die set (NOBEL RECTANGLES) misspelled or is it referring to ""Nobel"" as in Nobel Prize?

B00OU01K96,3.0,Purchased 2 of these. One has no issues at all but the other is not so great. The drawers do not open or close properly at all. Poor quality control. Read some comments that people actually have to shave some of the wood from the draws or used shims to prop up the drawers so that open and close properly. Not going that far but I wish US Art supply took quality control a bit more seriously.,One has no issues at all but the other is not so great. The drawers do not open or close properly ...,True,
B00OU01K96,5.0,"I actually ordered this through US Art Supply, because I had a promotional code for percentage off, but it was still fulfilled by Amazon. This is well built,  and practical, its also very nice looking. The box is all tongue and grove and slightly varnished, I was impressed by the craftsmanship. It is very sturdy and holds about 200 pencils. My ""art"" center is in the corner of our living room, so I wanted something that looked nice sitting on my desk, and this certainly does, in fact, the day I received it, I ordered another one.

B00OU01K96,5.0,"For me, this is the ideal solution to storage of a moderately large selection of soft and hard pastels. I bought the four drawer version, and iit easily accommodates  my collection of about 130 semi-hard pastel sticks and 35 pastel pencils, with one entire drawer left over for a basic selection of my soft pastels. There's plenty of drawer height for my Rembrandt soft pastel sticks (which are thicker than the semi-hard sticks), though I understand that someone posted that the drawers aren't high enough for Unison pastels. The sample I received has none of the defects described by others. It's attractive, compact, and the drawers slide in and out smoothly whether they're full or empty. It was not advertised as having foam lining, and it didn't come with lining, but that's not essential. A small piece of ""cutting mat"" could be purchased for about $20 if someone feels foam matting is necessary. ADDED One Year Later - I still think that, for me, this is the ideal storage ""system"" for my pastels. In fact I like it so much that, as my collection of pastels has grown, I've just bought a second box. By the way, I have not felt that foam matting is necessary.","Ideal storage for pastels, pencils",True,4

B00OU01K96,4.0,"I love these drawers for organizing art pencils.  The only issue I have with them is, as other reviewers mentioned, the drawers pull each other out so they all come out when you're just trying to open one.  I found the remedy to this was to make a jig out of popsicle sticks to shim up around the drawer pull to give a flat surface before running it through a table saw to shave off that little bit of excess on the top of the drawer faces.  It worked great and I found that most sets I purchased only needed this done on the very bottom drawer.  I have 8 sets of these and they all work great now.  I also still have all of my fingers.

I like they way these look in my workspace and they make everything really easy to find.  The dividers were easy to pull out for a customized drawer - once out they're also very easy to put back in if you change your mind.  The Last two photos show the drawers shimmed up with popsicle sticks ready to be run through the saw and the first four photos show the drawers fitting all kinds of various things. With the dividers removed, i find I can even put the whole derwent pencil tin in there - yet the drawers are shallow enough that theres no wasted space.

It houses about ~167 pencils, I have 2x that, so I guess I have to buy another one. I don't know why they hell they can't just make a hardy plastic one w/ lil' wheels, like those large art bins for scrapbookers. B/c after awhile storing lots of pencils get heavy in 1 unit such as this design.  I like wood, but I don't mind those clear, plastic art bins styles also.

B00YFPQ7YY,3.0,"I have followed the instructions for more than one brand of products very similar to this... and the results have been iffy. I am not sure if its the chemical that's difficult to use correctly, or if its just one of those products that don't quite work as advertised?

Still running into issues where the hardware seems not to be holding the process. Maybe it's user error,...? However I think that more information could be made available with the product. Still have not achieved the desired effect, as I have to re-finish the hardware.

It seems to be hit and miss with what metals will age more quickly. I have had 3 pieces of hardware, made of the same materials... and only 2 aged well. Now all three are losing the black patina.

B00YFPQ7YY,5.0,"I am a stained glass artist and use this to patina lead/tin solder.  I love the color this patina turns the solder.  I don't typically like the stark blackness of black patina, so this is a really nice alternative.  It looks like the solder would look after decades of oxidation.  It is also great when you do repairs on a lead came panel as it will darken the solder to match the color of the lead to make the repair spots almost unnoticeable.  When working with any patina, to get a successful reaction, you have to be sure the metal you are applying the patina to has been completely cleaned of any coatings, dirt, residues, oxidation, adhesives, or anything else that may be on the surface.  If you don't properly clean the metal, the patina won't be touching the metal and can't react with it.  I suspect that this was the problem with many of the negative reviews for this product - even if the metal looks clean, it probably isn't and needs to be thoroughly cleaned before applying patina.",Spectacular product,False,6

It comes off of the roll so easily, it easily tears and the tears are so perfect! Also, if you need to move it , it comes off so easily too without tearing the washi or any of the projects I had been working on. It also isn't to transparent, its a good consistency tape.

I can't wait to try them in the many different ways I could use these, especially for my crafting projects and all of the letters and mail that I send. They are like a matte paper tape and are really high quality. They are easy to pull from the tape roll and easy to tear. There is a lot more tape on each roll then I expected so they will go a long way. The ""white"" parts of the roll are actually sort of see through so if you put them on a color item then the color will show through the white part. However, the color parts are opaque and really bright colors. They are all so cute that I couldn't pick a favorite. I feel like they are exactly how they are pictured except more fun to see them in person! The adhesive is strong but not too strong that it's hard to manage. I don't believe that the adhesive is such that it would ruin any surface I put it on.

The cuts are perfectly straight, and there are no ragged edges like I have with the sliding-blade and guide-wire type trimmers I own. Cuts even very thin strips straight.

B018HB5D2I,3.0,"I use the larger guillotine to cut my 8.5"" x 11"" paper but had been using the smaller Tonic guillotine cutter for my every day card making.  I love the Tonic cutters, but the smaller one was just a little too small - so was very pleased when this larger version came out.  I like the larger base - and it's still small enough to use on my craft desk for every day.  I like the size markings on the base and it cuts pretty well.  I have two complaints about this cutter:  1)  It's really hard to get the guillotine open enough that I can get the paper up against the top edge - the guillotine sits particularly low at that point and I always have to remember to force it up to get the paper underneath.  2) The paper holder slips badly.  I always hold the holder down, but unless I have my fingers in JUST the right position, and am pressing VERY hard, the paper will slip when the guillotine cuts.  The paper holder is just too slick.  I end up recutting paper regularly - or having to replace the paper on the base half-way through a cut.

I feel like an artist with these in my hand. You have to hold them upright to fuse them and they lay better color if you continue too but you can hold them at an angle once you get the desired color. I haven't found a book yet they don't bleed through but I'm also very picky on what I color also. They have very little to no smell.

B01FVCVNFM,5.0,"Wow, for the price, this wooden pencil box is an amazing buy!  It holds all 120 of my Faber Castell colored pencils, plus enough room for 4 blender and burnishing pencils. One reviewer said her's didn't come with a foam liner to keep pencils protected, so I did as she advised and bought some thin art foam.  However, the box came in with black foam liner.  Since I already bought the art foam, I cut out pieces and added it on top of the black foam, just for the heck of it, but it wasn't needed.

The box is pretty well made, and sturdy. It's not "" finished "" like some expensive wood furniture would be, but it's strong and the drawers pull out easily. The only negative, and it's a small negative, is the little drawer handles are a little hard for my old fingers to grasp. I may add my own drawer pulls later, just to help me grasp it better.

B01FVCVNFM,4.0,"i use shallow drawer wooden boxes to hold my watercolor and gouache tube paints, as well as my overflow colored pencils in the studio.
i bought this because i felt it would hold all the paints in one unit.

first the pros: no foam insert, which is great for me, as i don't need the foam, and pulling it out can be a real pain.
multiple drawers all together in one place.
drawers slide easily
appears to be very sturdy and well put together

con: the drawers are not deep enough to hold the watercolor tubes
that's a pretty big drawback for me, hence the 4 stars, since i bought this specifically to hold my tube paints- and it appears to be a very tiny amount too shallow ......
it will hold pencils, so now i moved my surplus pencils in to the unit.... i don't have enough pencils to fill it so other things ended up going into this as well

B01FVCVNFM,5.0,"I use these storage boxes to organize my colored pencils collections, I have both 3 and 4 drawer boxes (US Art Supply) and this set is the best value for the money is just as good as the other higher priced art boxes. In fact, this drawer set has small wooden rails to hold the drawers in place and the previous ones I purchased did not, they merely stacked on top of each other. These tend to stick less than my other brands but using wax or soap on the bottom can help the drawers move smoother.

I remove the dividers on these by rocking them back and forth (they are glued down, a small amount of wood may come up but does not impact the overall quality of the drawers) and then line the bottom with thin art foam. By removing the divider you can fit 2 sets of 72 pencils in it perfectly. I stack mine by offsetting them on top of each other and it works just fine. I don't glue them down to each other because I tend to pick up the box and set it where I might be drawing or coloring. The drawers are slim in height and my alcohol markers do not fit in them, but gel pens and pencils fit perfect.
While these do have a finish on them it's very minimal so I do put a light coat of polyurethane on them for added protection from stains on the outside and front and they look great.","Excellent storage box, better than some brands",True,14.0

I did made some mistakes at first, which was the ratio of water to the charcoal. Also if you want a smooth and solid color, you would need more of the color material than the water. In this case I needed to add more charcoal to the container
I tried writing with the marker first few strokes had little color. However when I squeezed the container, more color came out. I suppose charcoal doesn't work too well with these brushes due to the filter.

Printing the design on one sheet of canvas then painting it, cutting it into fours and adhering it to four pieces of wood.. going with the boho / farmhouse theme.

B00IUDBV20,5.0,"I'm not sure what people who complained about the strength of these were expecting.  For me, they're a bit TOO strong, and I have to put tape and stuff on the ""female"" side to help keep them from fully connecting, since then it's difficult to get apart.

I'm using these to hold sliding blackout curtains closed.  I live in Wisconsin, and got a small spring loaded shower curtain bar for my hallway and the heavy blackout curtains to go on it, to put a bit of an attractive barrier between the great room / kitchen area of my house and the bathrooms and bedrooms, to keep the heat in here where we need it.  That works great, and our living room area is far more comfortable now with less heating costs.

The downside was going through, and having to rearrange the curtains every time we spread them apart to pass to the other part of the house.  That's where these came in.

I pressed them in, and they worked great, but I wanted something that wasn't difficult to pass through on the move.  If both sides of these join fully, they hold together more than I'd want in this application.  Hence the tape, to keep them from ""fully closing"" on each other.

For the price, it was a steal, and with my modification, they work pretty well.  But the tape has a tendency to get pressed in anyway and eventually they fully settle into each other again, so I may try a dab of hot glue in the female side of these as a more permanent solution.",Stronger than I had expected after reading the negative reviews.,True,

B00ZV76YP2,4.0,Good product!!!,Four Stars,True,
B00ZV76YP2,5.0,"To me this is not a product to use to make a few bracelets by a novice and that's it.  People are complaining about the edges, being too hard to bend  and the warping.  I happen to make jewelry and I have tools to remedy all of those problems.  I do not recommend for the Saturday hobbyist.  If it is too hard to bend it needs to be annealed which is heating it to a dull orange with a torch.  After you do that you will have to place it in a pot of warmed citric acid called pickling to remove the fire scale the annealing causes.  Then you have to shine it by sanding it and or tumbling it in a tumbler.  THEN you stamp it  as it will be soft enough to stamp and to bend.  Stamping hardens it.  So I would anneal it out the box because it is not soft enough to do both.  One a pic a buyer did it so well but I think she has some know how.  I also see people saying it is too filmsy for a bracelet.  14 GAUGE???  I use 22 gauge on cuffs sometimes which is far far flimsier.  The norm is 16-20. Understand that you want a cuff that will bend a bit especially if it gets caught while someone is wearing it, it could be the difference between it bending and falling off and losing the arm.  Also a cuff has to be flexible to put on and take off.  If you are too much of a newbie maybe you should not attempt to do things people have spent years studying.  I do not like the sellers selling point of it having a film coating, then the edges are rough.  Come on impress art!  Would you wear such a thing without sanding and shining that down?  I give it 5 stars because it is great for someone who has the tools and know how.",Not finished enough for a novice,False,3

It covers just enough to blend 2 different papers together at a meeting point, or to use to add extra support to my pocket pages or to line the edges of the papers together.  If you don't get it placed exactly right the first time you can lift it off the paper without damage to the designer paper or the tape and allow you to reposition the tape and it will stick.

The second pole also had problems connecting the middle to the bottom, but the top piece did not break off, and it may be able to hold some line, but the pole tip is very thin.  As the person I was with said, looking at the narrow end, ""it's a joke.""",It's a joke,True,3

B000EJ3BTO,5.0,Great for home poker games.  Heavy duty in nice carry bag.  Folds up for storage.  Opens up to fit on a 6' table.  Perfect.,Texas Hold'em Table Top,True,
B000EJ3BTO,4.0,"I bought this for my boyfriend and I to play poker with friends. We play frequently and have played on lots of different portable mats and tables. While this isn't a casino quality table I thought it was a great purchase and I know he enjoyed it. The item is about 5'2"" long, I wish it was a little bigger so it would really fit my 6' table but it played fine.

Pros:

- All of our guests were very impressed by it and enjoyed playing on the table - (we played with 7 people)
- It's flocked (speed felt) meaning the cards glide beautifully, the way it folds out means it doesn't have grooves or valleys for the cards to catch on and flip up (some hardboard folding mats do).
- It looks nice, the black looks elegant and my screen prints were pretty good (not perfect, I'm a screen printer, so I know, but they're fine)
- The cup holders fit my wine glasses and cups well
-It folds up nicely (but be gentle with it) and stores up in a nice case, it's easy to store in a closet or under a bed
- Some people don't like using the chip wells; because the two end parts are on the corners the people who preferred to stack their chips could sit on the ends and stack in front of themselves.

Cons:

- Buy good chips, because cheap clay composite, or plastic chips tend to chip little white specks all over the felt, I just vacuumed it clean with a hand vac, but be aware
- The hard board this is made out of seems to be slightly warped so that it doesn't always lay 100% flat at the ends
- The matt that has the craps and blackjack layouts is just regular felt, it grips well, but it was too big so I had to trim the corners to keep it from laying over the chip wells, it was also well creased on arrival
- The cup holders are shallow, they likely won't prevent a cup being knocked over
- When you get the item, the flocking will likely be flat in some places or 'striped' from the padding that was on it. Use a clean dish brush or suede brush to gently rub the flocking to get some of those ridges out (don't over do it or you'll rub it all off)","Pretty nice, not 100% but a good buy",True,5
B000EJ3BTO,4.0,"I bought this for Father's Day. It is very sturdy, actually it is quite heavy.  It has 4-stars because the carrying bag zipper is not working well. Once my husband goes to open the bag, I'm sure the zipper will be broken off since it doesn't smoothly open.  However, the table top and the insert (double-sided - there are not two inserts), is really perfect for his use.  The kids were more excited about the purchase than him.  It actually works well as a gaming table in general since it protects the table and has cup holders for drinks.",Poker Playing for Dad's Day,True,
B000EJ3BTO,5.0,"I love the materials, it is such high quality. I really look forward to using it. It comes in a huge box though!",Great Quality,True,

B000EJ3BTO,3.0,"First, this set is not overly expensive, offers 3 options for the price of one, comes with a carrying case (bag) and seems sturdy enough to last with some care on your part.  It, however, is not top quality craftsmanship.  It has issues, as described by other reviewers on the corners and the felt feels thin/cheap in some spots.  Overall, however I am not disappointed with this purchase, nor are the guys that come over and play on it.  The size is about right for a oval table that seats 8, although I tend to keep my games around 6 to give players some space.  The additional game covers basically sit on top of the table - not a professional inlay, as some of the more expensive sets include.  I'm not complaining about that, however, as I didn't pay for that extra and find that it serves its purpose.  I imagine with my 2 games per month average, this set will likely last me for about 2-3 years if I take care of it and keep the guys from spilling food/beverage all over it every game (not always the easiest).  All in all, if you are looking for a decent poker table with a few ""extras"" for other games, this isn't a bad choice.","A decent set, but far from perfect",True,
B000EJ3BTO,3.0,"The poker and blackjack layouts are great, but the craps layout is very small. It would be hard to play with more than one or two people. There is no way that an on/off puck would actually work on it. I thought that the craps layout would be the full size of the table, not just the size of the inner layout for poker. I have to find another source for a craps layout for our casino party. That being said, the table is perfect for poker or blackjack. Given the price, I'm still happy I purchased it, just disappointed with the craps part.","Good, not great",True,
B000EJ3BTO,5.0,"The quality of this board (for the $) was surprisingly great!  Each of the three pieces are made with thick plywood, I believe, as the board in the carrying case is somewhat heavy.  The painted numbers and lines are thick and seem very durable.  I am absolutely thrilled with it!","Very sturdy, high-quality tabletop board!",True,4

B000EJ3BTO,4.0,"Product arrived in great shape.  Its a sturdy table top and finished nicely.  The first time I unfolded it I put a couple of books on it to get it to lay flat.  By morning it was perfectly flat without the books and now when I pull it out again for a game it has no trouble folding flat.  The bag is hardly sturdy but keep sthe dust off the board while in storage. I really like this table top - its looks great.  My only complaint is that its a little small to realistically support 8 players. Sure, all the spots are clearly marked out - but they are just too close. That said, its a great table for 4-6 players and we have had 8 playing - you just need to be good friends :)",Plesantly surprised....,True,2
B000EJ3BTO,3.0,"63 1/2"" x 31 1/2"" and weighs about 7 1/2 lbs. Rigid foam board covered in a crushed velvet-like material. Comes with a double sided, thin, folding centerpiece with a ""Craps"" layout on one side and a ""Blackjack"" layout on the other. The layouts are silk screened into the material very well. The board folds using the cover material and has no metal hinges. It is necessary to have a table that is at least 60"" long to rest on, or else the folding top ends will buckle or bend. The top folds similar to the letter ""M,"" where the ends fold downward (as opposed to the letter ""W,"" where the ends fold up). The chip trays are black plastic and are 11 1/2"" long x 4"" wide x 1/2"" deep with a 3"" diameter cup well. The corner trays are about the same size, but angled. There are trays for 8 players, but I think it would more comfortable for 5-6 poker players or things seem too crowded. In my opinion, a very nice PORTABLE poker table top. Nice buy for $50-60 including shipping. Anything more is questionable.",Nice for Portability,True,16
B000EJ3BTO,4.0,"I am really happy with this table top.  I wanted a table top to start poker nights, but didn't want to spend a fortune.  This is a great value.

The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the first table top I received had a manufacturer defect.  The lining on the back had been installed incorrectly which prevented it from folding completely flat (it wasn't even close).  I bought it from PokerBargains, who sent a replacement without question and pre-paid postage to return the defective unit.

B000FH10F2,4.0,"Pros:
- I have the LifeSpan TR4000i and the thing is brilliant in the sense that it detects when the lubricant is low (and will tell me!); this lubricant, when applied, fixes the error and there is a noticeable improvement in the ride quality of the treadmill
- it's lubricant. It's not exactly vintage wine. Get it on your fingers and you'll be able to tell it does the job when you try to wash it off

Cons:
- I took off one star because it's annoying trying to squirt this stuff if any of it gets on the actual spring-loaded portion of the dispense; in other words, your finger will start slipping all around and things get messy
- I think that I may eventually try pouring this into a spray bottle (think trigger style) to see if that works better; it may also be easier to maneuver underneath the treadmill belt",I think a trigger style bottle would be superior,True,3

B000FH10F2,5.0,Excellent,Five Stars,True,
B000FH10F2,5.0,"This is a nice cheap solution to helping with your treadmill belt. Some reviews say the bottle is junk but I honestly didn't find it hard to use.

You lift your belt up a little, spray it under, and move the belt and do it again. You don't need to try and stick your arm under or spread it out like other reviewers commented. If you read the instructions on the bottle, it says after you are done to walk slow on your treadmill for a few minutes and it will spread itself out. Which I did, and it did. After I sprayed the solution 10-12 sprays on each side every 1/3 of my belt I could see it had the edges all covered. I walked on the treadmill at speed 1 for like 2 or 3 minutes and then I felt under and sure enough it spread all the way into the center. So you don't need to be sticking your arm under there trying to force it into the center.

Also according to the box if you follow the instructions each application will use about 1oz. It is a 4oz bottle. So you should get 4 applications out of each bottle. You are supposed to reapply every 40 hours of use. So for me, I use my treadmill 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week, so one application will last me 16 weeks (4 months). 1 bottle should then last me 1 year and 4 months (ish).","Works great, 1 bottle will last well over a year",True,34

B000FH10F2,5.0,Check with your treadmill manufacturer first to ensure compatibility but a large variety of treadmills suggest 100% silicone lubricant for lubricating the treadmill belt.  You can find my exhaustive review here http://goo.gl/UpBpR5 .  I lubricate my treadmill with this treadmill lube every two weeks or so and it helps to make my treadmill feel smooth and almost completely squeak-free!  I did purchase an additional wand from Amazon that I use for applying this lubricant underneath my treadmill's belt.  This lubricant is a must for anyone that want to prolong the life of their treadmill.  The spray bottle is nice but I wish that they also included a squeezable squirt bottle with a nipple on top.  This still works but that type of applicator would be optimal for how I lubricate my treadmill.,100% Silicone Lube/No Odor,True,2

Its hard work, but I found this treadmill lube to be a great help.  No more creaking, groaning or chaffing.  I spray this all over myself before I get on the treadmill.  Paying special attention to my thighs and chest.  It really does make my workouts alot smoother.  My nips no longer feel like they are getting run through a cheese-grater after those long runs.  And the reduced thigh-friction has improved my mile times by several seconds.

B000FH10F2,5.0,"I just bought a 1500 dollar LifeSpan treadmill desk which recommends using lube on the track from the initial setup but does not include even a small bottle in the box. So I had to go and find and order this for a few extra bucks. Annoying.

As for actually using it, I found the spray pump to make a mess and get lube everywhere. One must hold up the belt with one hand while attempting to spray inside the narrow space. This requires tilting the bottle to the side whereupon it no longer sprays of course. What worked better for me was to pour some in my right hand and spread it under the belt manually while holding the gap open with my left hand. It's nontoxic, and when you finish with the treadmill, you can also use it for sex. Instructions are similar. JK.

A better and cheaper option is to buy a 16oz bottle of low viscosity silicone oil here on Amazon for about the same price as this tiny bottle, and then use a small funnel with a plastic tube attached to pour a small amount under the treadmill belt.

This is not a gel as another reviewer commented...it is an aqueous solution and does spray quite nicely. I did have some help applying it though...I lifted the belt and my helper sprayed the solution. It couldn't have been easier.

- 4 fl. oz (118 ml), should be good for 6 applications if not more
- 100% silicone (claim on the label, probably close to true)
- spray nozzle (better than the Horizon-supplied squeeze bottle)
- recommended application is 1 oz after every 40 hours but my treadmill has a mileage-based schedule
- no smell

Sometimes after squatting heavy I walk like I came from the ""gay pride parade"" for a couple of days after. I used this right away and I kept my manlihood. My backs messed up and I get the good nitrogen snap crackle pops from this which brings instant relief. It is plain and simple, its not pretty, and comes in a box with only the receipt in it... you don't buy it for the looks. This thing works if your worried about the stiffness, YES it is stiff but after quite a bit of use it seems that its not as hard on my body unless im just getting used to it.

B000HLLREA,5.0,"Was skeptical to order this, decided to go for it, being that I can barely stand up from lower back pain, and I have 2 inoperable cysts  (1 behind each knee) that really makes it hard for me to even walk. Ive tried spinal decompression, inversion tables, streching, chiro, acupunture, for my back to no avail. Only temporary relief, then it all comes ""back"", no pun intended. A co-worker said he uses this and swore by it. Once I got it, I first said I cant believe I paid $30 for a piece of foam that doesnt look impressive. After the first time I rolled my back and legs on it, felt instant ""release"" points and just felt better in general. I even rolled over my painful knee ligaments (underneath area not top of knees) all the way to my calves and up my thighs. Seems to release tension like your getting massaged by a dough roller.
Will it cure anything? No, but really does make me feel a bit better, sometimes significantly. The only thing I find difficult is that when you do your hamstrings/thighs/calves, you have to support your butt and body by suspending it with your arms and shoulders, putting a lot of stress on them. If your a strong person or even moderately strong shouldnt be an issue. But Im a 40 year old slightly overweight and completely out of shape male who struggles if I have to keep doing that for more than a few minutes.
Just a few minutes even a day improved my circulation and kinda spread out thin the pain in my pressure points.
This IS a bit too long, about 30% of the length isn't even used, but the thickness and durability seem good. Of course if the foam starts to come apart I will come back to tell you about it. Hope this helps, as i am very aware the pain and suffering of people with these issues.
There was a foam about 1/2 the price, but I don't want the foam to be cheaper and fall apart only after a few uses. This looks cheap but it seems to hold up pretty well, with 185 pounds of yours truly rolling on it. And no way gonna pay for those 100$++ ones thats insane.
I had absolutely no clue how to use this, but there are many informative videos on youtube if you type ""foam roller."" that got me through it.",Interesting item for back pain,True,6
B000HLLREA,5.0,"I bought this because a third party website said it would keep its stiffness as compared to other rollers.  After several months of moderate use, it has held up.  Well worth the extra $$.

B000HLLREA,5.0,"This is the same foam roller they have at my crossfit box.

I love being able to work on mobility and sore spots whenever I need to!",Made to last,True,
B000HLLREA,5.0,"I love this thing.  I had one of the higher-priced rollers, but this one really suits my needs.  I use this to roll out my back and legs.  It really helps when I have tightness in my IT band, plus I have always had issues in my lower back.  For that, I will lie on my back with the roller underneath it until the muscle release.

B000HLLREA,5.0,"My gym has a couple different foam roller, and other misc roller, options to use.  However, the one that I found most helpful was this one from Perform Better.  I generally put a lot of stress on any sports products I use, especially when I'm putting force/weight on it.  So, I was worried that I was going to warp any roller I purchased.  However, after a few sessions using the different rollers available at my gym I realized that PB's version outperformed the others bar none.  The level of firmness and overall quality is solid and I worry not about letting my body roll over it with as much pressure as I can have applied at any given point along the roller.

B000HLLREA,5.0,"Good firm foam, not that white stuff that dents easily.  I ordered the 3 foot one because the web site said it was the most popular to order.  In reality, a 1 foot one is all that's necessary.  The longer one kind of gets in the way sometimes.  Finally used a serrated strong bread knife and was able to saw through after much arm power to make a 1 foot one with 2 feet left over for later use.

B000HLLREA,5.0,"I have to rave about this foam roller.  I think I was born with tight muscles, and for many years, especially recently as I've gotten older, I looked for ways to relieve the increased stiffness and tightness in my muscles, which I feel contributed to episodes of lower back pain.  The frustrating part of my search for relief is that no doctor or physical therapist or chiropractor that I consulted recommended or even mentioned a foam roller.  I had to learn about it through an internet search, decided to give it a try, and ordered this one a couple of weeks ago.  Already it has made a dramatic difference in how I feel, even in how I walk, as though I've recaptured the fluidity of youthful movement.  I highly recommend this brand, which seems durable.  Be aware that the more it hurts, and it can really hurt, the better for you, because that means it's hitting the really tight spots.  But with consistent application the pain begins to dissipate as your muscles experience relief and begin to elongate.  If you suffer from or have suffered from lower back pain, try rolling on it twice a day, first in the morning and last at night to forestall those dreaded spasms.  Try it; you won't regret it.",Wonderful product,True,

It is on-size at 10x12, and is approx. 10-mils thick. Good Poly tarp with decent grommets. The back-side of mine is 'unprinted' olive-drab color, so a 'wind flip' won't have you staring at a 'white' or blank reverse. As with most heavier PE tarps, you can use them for ground cover under your tent, or even as an emergency tent, itself. The only reason I gave it 4-stars instead of 5 is that when I bought my first two, they were $7.99 each, now they are almost TRIPLE that. Ouch, pricey now. I was going to buy two more and put them back, but at that price, I guess I'll just hold off for now. I love the Texsport gear, and have quite a bit of it (tents, stainless cups, plates, tarps, etc.) but that is a real premium on a PE tarp, just for the sake of that camo print - forget it, I'll just buy an olive drab one.",Excellent Tarp - but price has really gone up,False,
B000LC6DU8,5.0,"It's a cheap tarp, wasn't really anticipating much.

So, in May I went out to the campsite and re-covered a leanto that had fell victim to some wind-damage. (See photos)

Not bad.",Exceeded my expecations,True,4
B000LC6DU8,3.0,"I bought this tarp for backpacking as a tent footprint or an emergency shelter. It fits in my ILBE Gen 2 radio pouch perfectly. The material is thin and light weight, but seems strong. The camo design is dark and well colored. The company didn't cut corners with the print.

That all being said, one of the first things I noticed was a double stamped eyelet. I'll have to either remove it or file it down due to the sharp edge of the eyelet's interior. I also found a loose eyelet half so I checked the tarp to make sure it didn't cut it. All seems well, no cuts were found. The eyelets, themselves, aren't that great. They seem thin and can be easily bent. I've seen better and stronger eyelets on much cheaper tarps.

So all in all, I have to say it's an ""ok"" tarp. It's inexpensive and seems durable. Due to the double stamp eyelet, the loose eyelet, and the overall eyelet's thickness and type, I gave it three stars.

I use it in my camping/bug-out-bag. If you have ever been hiking/camping you know you don't want to carry a lot of weight! The bottom line is that if you want a light-weight tarp you can pull out in a hurry and use for a short time than this is for you.

The issue is with the grommets.  3 of them where not set correctly, leaving space between the gripping surface of the grommet and the tarp.  No fix for this.  One of the grommets was just never crimped properly.  It was only half finished, leaving a very sharp edge floating.  Easily fixed with a few blows of a hammer, however not propperly set.

Even if I contact them for a refund of this amount, look at all the additional hassle they created during the already frantic holiday season.
If this is a mistake, then it brings into question of how they are hiring, training, and compensating their employees. Someone obviously did not care. If this their actual price of the item it is bad business practice and illegal in many states.

B000LC6DU8,4.0,"As it goes with everything, you get what you pay for. This tarp is no exception, and if you know that when purchasing, you won't be disappointed. I purchased this to use as a cheap, emergency rain cover in my camping pack, and it fits that purpose well.

At $17 plus free Prime shipping, I knew I wasn't going to be getting an amazing tarp. But it's waterproof, fairly resilient to the elements, and perfect to its advertised size. The color of the tarp is not as vibrant as the product picture, but its no big deal since someone looking for a good camouflage tarp probably won't be looking to penny pinch anyways. This looks way better than that ugly blue, grey, or green colors and the irregularity of the camo print blends in with any dirt/mud/grass/etc that might get on the tarp; this is more of a personal preference, but I prefer this aspect.

It's lightweight, which some may view as a downside if you're planning on using this as an everyday protective tarp. But since I have this packed up tight at the bottom of my camping day-pack, I very much like it's compactness and light weight. In case you are wondering how small you can pack this tarp, here'es what I was able to accomplish: After unfolding the tarp when it arrived, I was able to refold it in my own configuration down to a compact size of about 8""x10""x4"", which I then gift-wrapped tightly with paracord sealed with a figure 8 knot.

I don't think this would hold up well to wear and tear, and a hole would quickly surface if you used it regularly (especially if you were to use it to cover things or as a ground cover for a tent). But again, at $17 for a fairly large size, you can't complain too much.

The edges where the metal-reinforced holes are is stitched pretty well, and I feel confident when I string it tightly to some trees using paracord. As a cover for my camping hammock, it does pretty well, and hasn't torn/come-undone yet.

Overall a pretty good deal. So far, this is worth the $17; if I can get 15 uses out of this tarp, I view it as about a $1 per use, which is fine by me. I've only used it once, so time will tell...","Well priced, inexpensive tarp - you get what you pay for",True,71

B000MB6T2U,4.0,"COLLAPSED
Collapsed, the stick forms a bundle 10 1/4"" long by about 2"" in diameter.  The bundle would be more compact (albeit about 11"" long) if the top-most and bottom most sections were a little longer relative to the other sections so that the head and the rubber foot would have extra space.  A ~10"" velcro strap (not included) would be helpful for keeping the bundle closed. Two velco-like cable ties (one would be too short), nose-to-tail could be used for the same purpose&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Velcro-Reusable-Self-Gripping-Cable-Ties-0-5-Inches-x-8-Inches-Long-Black-100-Ties-per-Pack-91140/dp/B001E1Y5O6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Velcro Reusable Self-Gripping Cable Ties, 0.5 Inches x 8 Inches Long, Black, 100 Ties per Pack (91140)</a>.

STORAGE POUCH
The flat 9 1/2"" X 4"" pouch is very poorly designed.  It is not large enough to close with the collapsed walking stick inside, and in any case has no closure (such as velcro patches).  A belt loop would be a very helpful addition, but there is no belt loop.  However the pouch does have a mysterious grommet---you could hang the pouch to a belt with a carabiner (not included) through the grommet.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rothco-Black-80-mm-Locking-Carabiner/dp/B000E96RQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rothco Black 80-mm Locking Carabiner</a>&nbsp;Alternatively, a ~4"" ball-bungy-cord (not included) could be used similarly.  A longer ball-bungy-cord could be used to simultaneously hold the bundle together, and attach it laterally to a belt without the pouch.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ball-Bungee-Cord-6-34-White/dp/B000S5TWWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ball Bungee Cord 6"" White</a>.

AS A WALKING STICK
The Stansport works very well as a walking stick.  It is very sturdy and the sections lock together, and so cannot collapse.  Despite the odd complaints of some reviews, I found the walking stick VERY easy to assemble and disassemble.  Indeed it is virtually self-assembling, and folding it up is very easy.  In contrast, most other designs consist of 3 to 5 collapsing sections, which you have to extend or collapse one-at-a-time, a much less convenient process than the Stansport.

TIPS AND FEET
The steel tip is great for outdoors hiking and probably will not slip even on hard ice, and the rubber foot is excellent for indoors, or outdoors on non-slippery surfaces.  The rubber foot is is exceptionally good at absorbing the impacts on hard surfaces,  However, the rubber foot only pushes on.  You'd instantly notice if you loose the rubber foot on an hard surface indoors, but not necessarily on a soft surface outdoors. I recommended taping the rubber shoe in place with 1 1/2"" wide or wider blue painters tape.  Replacement rubber feet are available, but for some reason Amazon will not allow me to insert a product link---in Amazon's ""Sports and Outdoors"" department, search for ""Stansport Trekking Pole Replacement Feet"", the package consist of two feet.  If you are planning a long trip, it might be a good idea to take a couple of replacement rubber feet with you.  The steel tip is also replaceable, look for ""Hiking Pole Replacement Foot with Tip"".

WRIST STRAP
A good wrist strap is essential so that you do not have to keep a death grip on the cork grip all day long--the wrist strap will catch your hand even if it slips.  The Stansport wrist strap is much too long at the upper end and cannot be shortened except by punching extra-holes (or better, burning holes with a soldering iron so that the nylon will ""cauterize"").  The adjustment buckle at the lower end slips if you put pressure on it, which could be dangerous.  I recommend adjusting the strap to your hand size, then gluing the buckle in place with fabric glue&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beacon-Fabri-Tac-Permanent-Adhesive-4-Ounce/dp/B00178MNFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beacon Fabri-Tac Permanent Adhesive, 4-Ounce</a>.

AS A CAMERA MONOPOD
The Stansport is a usable monopod in most circumstances.  Without the rubber foot, it is 48"" tall (placing your viewfinder at about 50-51"")---tall enough to use, bending over only a little.  Unfortunately, the 1/4"" diameter camera threads are 3/8"" long---about 3/16"" too long.  If you tighten your camera down too hard, you might damage it.  You can shorten the threads with a few washers, but perhaps the best solution is to replace the compass-knob with a ball head when you plan to used it as a monopod.  A ball head will also raise the height by about 2"", placing your viewfinder at about 52-53"", and allows you to rotate the camera 90 degrees to take vertical photos&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Professional-Mini-Ball-Head-Camera-Mount/dp/B000L47AHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Professional Mini Ball Head Camera Mount</a>.  Unfortunately 52"" is much too short for birding or some other uses.  Most standard monopods extend to 67"" or so (15"" taller than the Stansport)---sometimes you need the extra height. I have not found a taller monopod which is comparably compact for travel.  Among similar inexpensive taller (but not so compact) monopods are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vivitar-VIV-VT-67-67-Inch-Monopod/dp/B003WPTBAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vivitar VIV-VT-67 67-Inch Monopod</a>

Try to use the rubber foot when using the pole as a monopod to minimize jaring to your camera.

Unfortunately, the Stansport is essentially non-adjustable, and while you can shorten it in 10"" increments---doing so exposes the rubber cords to wear and dirt.  In contrast, the collapsible designs of nearly all other monopods allow infinite adjustments in height.  It is often necessary to shorten monopods for use when sitting down, when taking nature photos at low level, when bracing the bottom end against your belt-buckle, or when you can place the bottom on a fence or railing etc.

A BETTER TRAVEL MONOPOD
Assuming that you require a walking stick/monopod that folds to less than 16"" for travel, then consider also:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norazza-Monopod-lightweight-TD140/dp/B000W8SSDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norazza Monopod-lightweight TD140</a>&nbsp;It is lighter and more compact than the Stansport, and is a better monopod but not quite as good as a walking stick.  My wife and I use our 2 Stansports only for serious hiking, we use our 2 Norazzas for photography.

A BETTER WALKING STICK
If you do not need such compactness, there many better monopods/walking sticks available. For example:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Promaster-Monopod-Walking-Stick-Black/dp/B001S3O450/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Promaster Monopod/Walking Stick ~ Black</a>

FIT & FINISH
Good for the price, albiet there were several long, wide scratches on the bottom-most section of the one I bought---evidence of very poor quality control.  It is ""Made in China"".

CORK GRIP
The cork grip comes with a temporary protective plastic covering, which you can remove, or it will eventually fall off.  The cork grip is naturally cushioned and absorbs sweat making for a secure grip---an excellent solution, 50 years ago. Most modern hiking sticks have shock-absorbing plastic grips often with molded finger grooves for a much more secure hold.  Not only can the cork grip easily be stained and damaged, skin acids will probably cause it to disintegrate with heavy usage, particularly if stored wet. Damanged grips can be covered with a leather covering&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tandy-Leather-Walking-Stick-Grip-Wrap-Kit-4362-00/dp/B002OMZ9TO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tandy Leather Walking Stick Grip Wrap Kit 4362-00</a>

Many reviewers complain about the cork grip coming loose.  Mine isn't loose.  If it comes loose, a little Elmers White Glue can easily fix it.  Pull the grip down on the pole, apply glue to the pole, slide the grip back up into place, and wipe off any excess.  There are stronger glues, but white glue is adequate for this purpose and cleans up with a damp cloth.

WALKING STICK OR A CANE?
If you do not need a monopod for your camera, a collapsible cane might serve you better.  For example&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ez2care-Adjustable-Folding-Cane-with-Carrying-Case-Black/dp/B0050R7ZJC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ez2care Adjustable Folding Cane with Carrying Case, Black</a>&nbsp;A cane is inherently shorter than a walking stick, so collapsible canes are more compact and potentially lighter.  You can also put more weight on a cane than a walking stick.  A walking stick is more for balance, a cane is more for support.

CONCLUSION
Almost a great walking stick/monopod.  A great idea, poorly implemented.  Just a little more attention to design details would make a world of difference.

B000MB6T2U,1.0,The idea of a pole than breaks down to fit in a backpack is terrific. However... the cork grip was floating and could move down the pole... one of the three elastic strands that holds the pole together (like a tent pole) dislodged from the top when first used and had to be removed... the foot is not solidly attached... and the paint is rapidly coming off.,Perfect idea and very bad workmanship,True,7

The stick unravels easily by itself.  I just wip it out and it unfolds and goes together in a second.
decent grip and it has a strap to go around wrist so u can put weight on wrist and not hand.

B000R9T7GM,2.0,"This is about like looking through the bottom of a green beer bottle.  The zoom is minimal if at all.  The image quality is horrible.  If you have to have a night vision and can't afford the digiscope then this is your best bet.  However, don't expect miracles even with extra IR.  The ATN unit didn't even work when it arrived.  If this was all the money I had to spend then this one is better than the ATN in my opinion.  Although the ATN did not work when it arrived I can tell you the build quality of the Yukon felt much better.  It felt like a much more precision piece of equipment.  The Yukon is much heavier than the ATN.  Maybe that had something to do with it arriving in working order and the ATN arrived defective.  I gave 2 stars because it is functional and you can get a kill with it at really close range but overall I think the quality is REALLY bad.  You have a bubble in the middle where the image is fairly clear and then a ring around the outside that is nearly useless.  It's nothing like the videos and image samples they provide.

B000R9T7GM,1.0,"I have requested the return labels from Amazon to send this back.  Time and effort trying to make this work has wasted days of my life.

Focusing this thing at a hundred yards is POOR quality even in daylight mode.

Installing it on a Savage .223 to fix a coyote problem.  The Savage Axis/Edge needed a Picatinny military style mounting rail.  There is only one made for this gun from EGW #41800 that bought through Amazon via Optics Planet I believe.  Finally got the scope mounted and the bolt action slides back touching the scope lightly - put in spacers to clear without rubbing.  Bore sighted at sporting goods store with the Bushnell laser boresighter kit.  Was boresighted at 25 yards and these guys have always got my guns on paper at 25 and a hundred.  This was 2 feet high at 50.  Shot half a dozen shells in a light drizzle - cool humid day.  55-60 Degrees?  Now on paper at 50.  Reticle is visible when scope goes black.  Can't see anything but the reticle in daylight.  Check batteries - but why is the reticle working if the scope is not?  Not batteries.  Half hour of shutting it off - cleaning lenses thinking fogged up or moisture?  Pinhole in daylight cap isn't plugged or have a water drop in it.  ???  Later in night conditions - turn on night vision and IR - still nothing!!  Great .... warranty issue.  Next morning turn it on and look through it like nothing ever happened.  Looks fine.  Talk to Yukon reps in TX - they deduce that the ""water resistant"" rating is too vague for this scope and that moisture must have gotten into the electronics of the scope and ""kinda shorted it out"" but the reticle electronics are in a different place on the scope.  They tell me to take it out and see if it happens again.  While they send me an e-mail the next day for the warranty process.

I take it out to try and fine tune at 100 yards and here is my biggest complaint - 2.5 magnification is misleading.  At 100 yards - the target is bigger with the naked eye by 25% than in this scope.  My Leupold 2-7 on the ""2"" is 2+ times bigger than this scope is.  It is closer to a .75 power magnification.  At 100 yards, the reticle covers an 8 inch target.  That is 8 inches left-right and 8 inches up-down.  Who can have a nail driver when cross-hairs cover the size of a basketball?  I am an expert marksman and with a ""Lead-sled"" vise locked down can't hold a ""group"" of any pinpoint accuracy with this scope.  If you turn the reticle brighter - you see two sets of reticles like double vision - Awesome..... pick one?  Faint reticle still has a low visual quality at 100 yards when ""focused"" and covers my 8 and 10 inch ""Shoot-N-C"" targets.  This .223 holds a 1/4 inch group vised in a Lead-Sled with a 3-9 leupold.  It holds a ""barn door"" sized group with this Yukon scope.  No - daddy isn't happy with this piece of junk.

I get home and check my e-mail and have received the Yukon TX email.  A return authorization # to have it looked at under warranty.  Pay for shipping, print off labels and write up problems, insure package and include money order or check for $10 for the techs to ""access"" the scope -  um...... NO.  I am not paying for a new item to be looked at after I pay to ship it off with defective junk issues.  Sending back to Amazon expecting a full refund.  Way to many problems and lack of quality design.

An honest comparison is this - Take a beer bottle (green), grab a fat red felt tip marker and draw crosshairs on the bottom of the bottle, Duck Tape the bottle on your rifle so you can look through the top of the bottle at the bottom where your crosshairs are and don't forget to Duck Tape a mini-maglite under your barrel.  Imagine being drunk to the point where you keep struggling to focus your eyes.  Turn on the flashlight and look through your new Yukon NVRS scope.

B000T43SGK,5.0,"I own several different laser bore sights by Sightmark, in a number of different calibers.  I also have one of their universal laser bore sights. I've found all of their products to work quite well so far.
I've found these in the chamber type of laser bore sights to work much better than the universal types which hang out from the muzzle.  The machining on these in the chamber types by Sightmark is quite good. With the firearm firmly mounted in a heavy bench rest, I've rotated the sight to several positions in the chamber and seen very little change in the point of the dot even at 100 yards, which indicated to me not only a very good machining, but also a very good adjustment of the laser within the brass body.

One thing to bear in mind with these sights are that while they do feature a rim like a standard cartridge, the sight is not meant to be removed from the chamber by means of the extractor and bolt.  While you will get best results by gently letting the bolt close and push the sight snugly into the chamber, the sight will not simply fall out upon opening the bolt and again, it is not meant to be extracted like a standard cartridge.  to remove it is best to open the bolt and keep it open while using a cleaning rod from the muzzle end to gently push the sight out from the chamber.

While very well made and adjusted, these devices still have very slight variations from true center, which becomes more noticeable with distance as does the increase in the size of the dot.  Yes, it is a laser but it is a laser diode, not a high end gas or sapphire rod laser, so the coherence of the beam is not 100% and the diameter will increase with distance.  That isn't a negative though as it helps you to see the dot at distance with the naked eye.  Try seeing the period of a sentence on a newspaper page 25 yards away with the naked eye and you'll get what I mean.  Even with the increasing dot size at distance and a good spotting scope though it is best to use the laser bore sight in less than full daylight light levels.

These laser bore sights are truly ideal for a shotgun though, as they give outstanding results at distances under 50 yards.  With a 12 gauge shotgun you really aren't likely to be trying to hit dead center of a bullseye as you would with a rifle or pistol, let alone would you be doing so for a distance of 100 yards.  If you are using this to set ghost ring sights, reflex/holographic or laser sights for use on a defensive shotgun however, the distance required is considerably less and the results of using this bore sight will be as close to perfect as you should want.

Due to its size this laser bore sight probably could have used a single CR123 battery rather than three small AG13/357A, or LR 44 batteries that it requires, but it's not likely to be used often enough for that to be an issue.  It also would be nice to have an on/off switch rather than having to remove the batteries, but again due to infrequent use it is not really much of an issue.  It could have used a green laser which would have greater visibility at long distance or in full daylight, but for a shotgun the distance isn't an issue and a green laser would have driven the cost up to more than double what it is.",I've found these in the chamber type of laser bore sights to work much better than the universal types which hang out from the .,True,6

It can be a little awkward to use, but I have had no problems with it.

UPDATE: After a few runs at the range, I examined this a bit more closely, and found that orientation makes difference. The laser apparently does not center very well in the barrel, and rotating the unit in the  gun resulted in significant differences in dot placement, even at 25 yards.

B000T43SGK,4.0,"I bought this laser bore sight to practice my shotgun mount and swing.  It works very well for this.  Obviously, because of distance and ambient lighting effects, it works best indoors, but an external wall or other suitable outdoor surface may also work well if not in bright sunlight.  The only limitation of this product was the ""reliability"" of the on-off function of the laser.

As others have said, there is no on-off switch; rather, the light is energized by placing all three watch batteries in the unit and screwing the end piece on.  Getting the laser to work usually takes some playing with the tightness of the threaded end cap.  Also, there are times when the laser is on, but turns off when placed in the shotgun and closed (I have an O/U - I didn't try it in a semi-auto or pump).  These are fairly minor annoyances, taking little time to overcome, but really caused others to severely downgrade their ratings.

One other caution: the light can be energized by simply leaving all three batteries in the unit even without the end cap attached, so I store it with only one battery inside and two loose in the handy pouch.",Laser Boresight Works for Gun Mount Practice,True,5

I put in the Sightmark 12Ga Boresight and peered through the scope.  It was way off, so I adjusted it so the bullseye of the scope matched the laser point.  So, I assume that when I shoot these high end Hornady SST slugs, they should be grouped near the bullseye within inches.  I used sandbags to stabilize the shotgun.  They were punching holes to the lower left of the target, far from the bullseye.  After considerable adjustments to the scope, I finally got it to group near the bullseye.

B000T43SGK,5.0,"I have researched boresights off and on for a couple of years. I always backed away because, once sighted in, they are unnecessary. Besides that, bolt action rifles can be boresighted without devices and be close enough to fine tune afterwards (which is all any boresighter can do).

The most accurate boresighters seemed to be the type that fit in the chamber. There is little room for misalignment with them.

I recently bought a turkey shotgun and wanted to put my EOTech sight on it because I'm cross eyed dominant and my shooting side has the bad eye.

The Sightmark fit as it should and put a dot on my target. Once I adjusted the EOTech dot to match, I was done. Pattern testing showed the scope was spot-on at 40 yards. Job done.

I don't know about battery life. Because of the comments on it, I purchased a package of spares but never needed them. If you just get down to business and don't sit around playing with it, the batteries should last through several sightings. You only need to use it when changing scopes or setting up a new firearm.

I then put the unit in the chamber, secured the gun and rotated the sight 360 degrees (twice)...no  change in placement of dot!. I then chamber the unit 12 times in a row like a shell (good hard slams), no jams or failure...even rechecked the alignment again. Dead on.  Last I stood the full 150 feet of my drive way in daylight, and saw the dot! In close, everyone do/buy what you want, but Sightmark is the ONLY laser bore light I will ever own. P.S., for those that want an on/off switch and don't like twisting the cap or removing the batteries for storage...  ""oh please....I won't even comment on that"". This is NOT a toy. I am not knocking anyones past experience. This is only mine...for what it is worth.","Is Tough, Accurate and Does the Job",True,74
B000T43SGK,3.0,"This bore sight payes for itself quickly.  I have a Savage 220 slug gun, and the ammo is not cheap.  Using the bore sight probably saved me 8-10 rounds of three-dollar shells.  However, if you want to sight-in beyond about 50 yards, you're going to be disappointed.  Maybe you could see it's red dot a little better if you sighted in just after dark, but otherwise forget about it.  I'm still glad I bought it, but I think a high-power green dot would work better.","Ammo saver, but...",True,3
B000WCOBJW,4.0,"I bought this watch as a gift for my husband and he likes it. He does complain that the alarm is too soft and doesn't chime long enough. There are a lot of functions on this watch which can become quite confusing. Other than that, it's great.",Great watch,True,7
B000WCOBJW,5.0,"I've been impressed with everything about this watch since receiving it.  First off, the looks are great.  It's a large watch, but the styling is nicely done and it looks decent on my average size wrist. I like that it is not bold or busy. It is fairly intuitive to adjust and access the many functions. The three major functions of the watch are easily accessed from the corresponding buttons on the right side.

I particularly like that this is a solar powered watch, with a handy indicator at the bottom of the display showing the level of charge.  It took a week or so of normal wear to fully charge the battery, but it has maintained it's full charge with only a minimal amount of direct sunlight daily.  The owner's manual states that with normal use it needs only 5 minutes of sunlight daily to maintain the charge, and it has so far proven true.

The compass function appears to be quite accurate, but I haven't used it very much so far.  The compass will shut off after about 20 seconds, I assume to save battery power.

For an accurate temperature reading the watch must be removed from the wrist.  Your body heat will affect the reading significantly, but that is to be expected with this type of thermometer.  Once removed from the wrist, it will take at least 15 minutes for the temperature to stabilize.  I suppose that unless you have the watch sitting on your nightstand or you are in the middle of nowhere, there are probably quicker ways to find the actual temperature.

The barometer seems fairly accurate when compared to the local pressure reading from the nearby government weather station.  The trend graph is a nice touch.  I haven't used the altimeter much but it's important to note that it must be adjusted periodically to match your actual elevation, as with any altimeter the reading is computed against the ever-changing barometric pressure.

The atomic time keeping has worked very well for my location in the central US.  I live approximately 550 miles from the Ft. Collins transmitter, and the watch will receive the time signal each night when it is removed from my wrist and sitting on my nightstand.  I've stayed up late enough to notice that it does have some problem receiving a signal while I am wearing it, but that is expected as stated in the product manual.

Since the intended use of the major functions is in an outdoor/adventure type of environment, then this watch adequately fits the bill.  For me it just makes a great, good looking daily wear watch.",Feature Filled Timepiece,False,43
B000WCOBJW,5.0,"This was a great watch and I wish it did not get stolen.

B000WCOBJW,5.0,"I love everything about this watch.  I actually forget that I have all the tools strapped to my wrist that I do.  I had one of the first Pathfinder's and that thing was like a deck of cards strapped to my wrist.  This much newer model is not much bigger than a normal sports watch.  I tested the altimeter and the altimeter recording function while mountain biking, and it performed great.  I've used the compass just for giggles, not for navigation, but it seems to work great too.  The barometer is about the only thing I haven't tested, but it always turns on and gives a reading.  Of all those awesome tools, my most favorite is the timer.  I set it to 25 minutes when I go on break at work and I never have to check what time it is; I just go back when it goes off.  Because of that, I also know that the buttons can withstand several presses a day without shorting out.

B000WCOBJW,3.0,"First, let me say that it is a rather dangerous notion that anyone would take a non-GPS wristwatch seriously enough to depend on it for any legitimate use. These watches are not much more than techno bling.

PROS:
It's a techno-gadget and gadgets are fun. Looks decent, tells the time and date well. Solar and atomic time are excellent features and work well for me in the northern US.

CONS:
The Compass is inaccurate. I calibrated it by the manual. But often it thinks South is North. You could end up dead with that kind of inaccuracy.
UPDATE: After performing a northerly calibration about 10 or 20 times, it now seems to know which way is North. I still have no idea why the thing kept reading 180 degrees off previously. Regardless, I'd only use this compass to find a general heading. In NO WAY would I ever use this compass with a map in a legitimate situation.

The Altimeter is inaccurate. I set the base value to zero in my driveway, drive around all day, and when I return home it measures anywhere from -40' on one day to 200' another day. In fact, I can calibrate it to zero in my living room, come back 10 minutes later, and it will not be at zero. That being the case, how can anyone expect to climb a mountain and return with any kind of accurate data about their trek? Elevation alone isn't much use for hiking if you don't also know the distance you've traveled. An altimeter would seem more useful to an airplane pilot who only needs an altitude figure. However, the instructions advise against using the watch for such a purpose. So an altimeter on a watch doesn't seem very useful. You really need GPS for elevation over distance traveled. I'd prefer the graph to be shown in the largest portion of the screen so I can see the terrain as I cover it, with the number at the top of the screen and the time of day at the bottom. The way this watch records and stores Altimeter data boggles the mind- scrolling through records and pages of data and trying to delete this information has been a lesson in futility for me.

The Barometer is decent. It seems accurate to within 5 something-or-others. When it says 29.95 I get the same reading from my smart phone's weather report. But again, i'd much prefer to see the bar graph in the large portion of the screen, with the actual number at the top and the time of day at the bottom. It's been showing a steady trend downward for over 36 hours today, but no bad weather in sight by any local weather reports. Has no alert for approaching bad weather. One must consider the value of this compared to a weather rock outside one's window sill, where if the rock is wet, you can be sure it's raining.

Thermometer: let's face it, we're sporting a device whose sole purpose is to be worn on the body. Why should we have to remove it each time we want to see the ambient temperature? They can't fix this at this point in technological history?

The backlight, still, ridiculously shuts off after only 1 second, pissing me off every time. It makes sense to have this be user-adjustable on this watch, since: there's a lot more to look at than the current time, and this watch is rechargeable, so power usage isn't a real concern.

Illogical button navigation: let me tell you a very logical secret: UP should INcrement and DOWN should DEcrement. But this watch is backward, like so many Casios. By what logic should the top button decrement and the bottom button increment? Answer: only if you were to take the watch off your wrist and hold it in front of you with the band set horizontally left to right. But on the wrist all watches are viewed as though 12:00 were north. So the up/down buttons are annoying.

One more: why can't the date read like most other Casios? Why can't I have: ""Mon. 02.27""? Nobody needs to read the current year. I need a glance at which day of the week today is, which month we're in (for when the month rolls over every 30-ish days), and the number of day today is within the month. But this most useful feature is missing!

This watch looks ok, though rather plain.

Let's put this watch and others of its non-GPS kind in context: the MFRP is 300 US dollars. You can get one HECK of an awesome and accurate hiking GPS unit for that much with cash left over for accessories. I only bought mine because it was 50% off on sale. Moreover, GPS watches are beginning to appear in the 200-500 range, and the features of those things blow these ABC watches in the dust for not all that much more.

ABC watches are outdated, horribly inaccurate and lack some of the most basic logic on a techno watch, such as backlight timeout and button logic.

I'd buy these ABC watches for under 150 bucks, just for the gadgetry of it. But for real outdoor tracking, it's a FAR wiser investment to go with a real GPS device. Even better to bring a manual compass and map.","Non-GPS Watches are illegitimate, but fun novelty",False,4
B000WCOBJW,4.0,"I purchased this as my only watch I own with the hope that it will be the only watch I ever have to purchase again.  I haven't been able to test many of its claims to durability and shock-proof-ness, but it seems very rugged.  The material the band is made of seems like it is very durable.  It feels somewhat rubbery, but it's not uncomfortable, grips your wrist and shouldn't be uncomfortable when wet.

I really like the way it pretty much automatically does everything for you.  It keeps graphs of most of its data, which is neat and helpful in a watch.  I wouldn't rely on it as my ONLY compass, though.

It took a couple of days to find the signal for auto-time keeping, but setting the time zone it was accurate even without that.  (not docking points for this, as I didn't do the manual calibration, and I pretty much had it near everything it said NOT to have it near when calibrating, TV's, large metal objects, electronics, not keeping it near a window, etc)

recently the band pin broke.  i cobbled it together for a few months with a pin that almost fits.  eventually, two attempts later, if failed for good.  i sadly put the broken watch away and picked up an analog casio from Costco.  (nice watch too!).

i thought it was over.  no more atomic accuracy..no more ABC buttons.  damn.  on a whim i sent it in to casio repair.  they sent me notification that my watch can be fixed for $14 + $8 shipping.  woohoo!!  i authorized the repair and they sent it back in three days.  strapping that watch on was like seeing an old friend again. looking at the bill, it was expensive because all they did was replace ONE of the pins. the band and other pin are still the old ones.  wish they would have simply given me two new pins and a new band.  might go another five years.

i love this thing.  not to expensive, so if some pickpocket on some island takes it from me..  and damn accurate.  i love meeting others with similar timepieces and seeing the time synced up the the exact second.  i live in San Francisco, so the atomic syncing can be hit/miss.  mostly hits.  when i got it back from repairs it had been months since it last synced.  i had a hard time manually syncing the time, but it got easier in the evening.  it has connected every night since.

one day, i will own some mega money chronograph.  but i will always have a pathfinder on my ""hard"" trips.  mine is scratched and worn down looking, but the face is nice and clear.  my wife bought it from amazon for my birthday.  great gift.  i am wearing it now.  on high elevation hikes, it is not reading the same elevation as my brother's Suunto.  who know which is correct?  who cares.  the temp tells you some random temp average of your wrist and the ambient temp.  taking it off will give you a good reading, but could result in a lost watch.  i don't do it.

I calibrated the barometer and now I'm only 300 feet below sea level. This is absolutely unacceptable for a watch of this type in this price range. The thermometer seems to be fairly accurate if you leave it off of your wrist for 30 minutes and it probably keeps time well.

I've had it for over a month and still am not familiar with how to do everything. It keeps excellent time. When I first opened the box it was a bit off and set to the wrong time, but the next morning after it picked up its time signal, it was to the second what the time standard on-line was giving. The altimeter varies quite a bit with barometric pressure, so your absolute elevation will change from day to day. I live at 79 ft above sea level according to the local marker, but the watch has read anywhere from 40 to 280 ft. The stopwatch function is a little difficult to read in the decimal fractions as those digits are in the upper part of the display, and are much smaller than the seconds digits. The only thing I really wish was different is the band. It's much longer than the bands on any other watch I've had, and could easily go around my ankle (I weigh ~155), which leaves quite a bit of excess band sticking out.

B000WCOBJW,2.0,"I am a fan of Casios. Although inexpensive they are among the most accurate and reliable timepices you can get.

This one breaks the mold. To begin with, mine did not keep time very well.  It could lose 10s of seconds a day.  I don't know how this is possible in a quartz watch but I saw it lose time against several other atomic clocks.

The altimeter/barometer is a flawed concept to begin with.  When you are climbing outdoors the reported pressure falls and the calculated altitude rises either because you are climbing or because the barometric pressure is falling or both, you can't tell.  The reported numbers can swing up and down by a hundred feet or so for no reason.  You have inaccurate reporting of an unknown mix of variables. Almost useless information.

Likewise, the temperature reported is not the temperature of your body or of your surroundings, but something in between, a useless number.

You can buy a much more accurate and useful compass for $20.00 at any store that sells them.

B000WCOBJW,5.0,"I have a ton of Casio watches, including three old alti-barometer watches.  When this series came out, I waited a while and then jumped on it.  It has everything one could want.  Well, it does everything it says it should, and very well.  However, after about one year of use, I'm running into problems.  I fly for a living, and this is the watch I take with me.  I usually go to Europe five times a month and I wear this watch, when I'm home in the US this watch sits by a window to charge up and receive the atomic clock.
Well, the watch makes it to Europe, but on the return, it usually dies on me.  It goes from battery High indication to a dead screen with a flashing ""C"", meaning it went into power saver mode trying to recharge.  At this point it loses all information - time, date, altimeter settings etc...  The other day it started flashing an ""R"" and froze up.  Haven't found that in the manual yet.  But I'm giving up on it.  A watch is no good if it can't reliably show the time, and this one doesn't do that.
My guess is that the rechargeable battery is dead.  The watch is out of warranty now, so I'm on my own with it.  I found a place online that sells these rechargeable batteries, I guess I could give that a try.  Still, disappointing, you would think a solar watch would work a whole lot longer than a regular battery.

Edit:

I bought a new rechargeable battery for nine dollars from a NY online store and changed it myself.  The watch works perfectly now and hasn't dipped below a ""High"" charge since and that has been about a year.  It has taken a lot of abuse in the last two years and still works great although the plastic on the sides is pretty scuffed.  I changed the rating to a five star rating now since it works as it should.  Still not pleased that Casio sent it out with a bad battery.  By the way, it does receive the German and British time signals perfectly.  Haven't tried the Japanese one yet.  It is a little annoying that the watch needs to be told that it is in a different country though, rather than scanning for a signal by itself.  I usually don't bother since the watch is accurate enough for a while without updating.  Like most Casio's, it runs fast a few seconds every month if it doesn't update.

Update October 2011:

The cot came quickly and was very easy to put together (literally, 1) unfold cot 2) place mattress on top of cot).  This Blantex model appealed to me because it had extra support beams in the middle.  I wanted to be sure that the cot could support individuals of varying weights.  My brother (who is over 200 lbs and 6 ft) has slept on this cot multiple times with no complaints regarding comfort.  I have no complaints regarding its durability.  It has the capacity to withstand individuals of varying weights without wear and tear.  Since my purchase a year ago, the cot has probably been used 20-25 times and the mat is still in good shape and the frame strong.  The cot folds up easily for storage in a closet (and possibly under a bed if the bed is tall enough).

B0011ZH312,2.0,"There is nothing ""pre-assembled"" or ""easy to install"" about this product. Once you get them installed, one thing you should know is that it is practically impossible to use these if you wear running or hiking shoes, or any other type of shoe that has pronounced track patterns in the sole. The reason is that the sole track catches on the pedal itself, which makes it very hard to slip your foot in, and twice as hard to pull it out. Keep in mind that when you install these straps, you can no longer simply place your foot on the pedal... You have to slip/slide it in and out. My new trail-running shoes have very pronounced tracks that catch on the pedal right away, making it practically impossible for my shoe to move back or forth without lifting my foot off the pedal. If you wear shoes with fairly flat soles, then these straps are a lot easier to use.

I returned the straps because I simply do not want to be confined to wearing a certain type of shoe in order to use my bike. If that wasn't the case, I would opt for clips instead of these odd looking things.","Not easy to install, and can't be used with pronounced track soles.",True,
B0011ZH312,5.0,"I have been using these on all my mountain bikes for about 20 years, and I love them. When I got the first set, I had never used straps or cages, and I was afraid I might crash, but I didn't, and got used to them quickly.  I used to ride in the mountains a lot, and I would hate to ever have to do it without them! They really increase my power to the pedal.  At one point all the guys I was riding with went to clipless pedals. I am not sure they were happier with them (they crashed a little at first with the clipless :-o). Clipless pedals did not make them faster up the hills than me.  Power grips allow me to choose to wear the shoes/hiking boots I like, and not be limited by what is compatable with my pedal. This is important to me. I like to find a lightweight hiking boot that has a very stiff sole to use with these most of the time, but they work fine with my regular athletic shoes for quick trips around the neighborhood.
When I install a new set of powergrips I take some extra time to get them adjusted just right, and use some loctite on the screw threads. Then I usually don't have to do anthing else to them for hundreds and hundreds of miles, unless I get new shoes. I have only worn out one set, it took years and years and hundreds (if not thousands) of miles to do it.
I do miss the choice of colors we had in the past. Right now I have a yellow set on my yellow bike, a blue set on my blue bike, and a black set on my silver bike.

On the positive side, i really enjoyed being able to pull up, and I felt good that my feet weren't going to slip off the pedals. The reason that I tightened the straps after two weeks is that my shoes were going a bit too far into the straps, and I was worried that would make it harder to get out of the straps quickly.

B0011ZH312,4.0,"This is a review of Power Grips 375mm written on 15 June 2014.  I have not received and will not accept any compensation or discount for writing this review or trying the product.  I am not employed by any manufacturer, distributor or retailer of anything.

I used plastic toe clips for over a decade so these were easy to get used to.  I just switched to dual pedals:  cleat on one side and platform on the other, so the plastic clips wouldn't work any more for me, which was a problem because I wear street shoes when biking short distances.  Still, for cleat riding I have to strap these up out of the way so they don't scrape on the pavement.  That's a better compromise for me than going no-strap no-clip when I wear street shoes.

Notes:
1.  I got the longer ones.  These straps are long.  I have plenty of room for my size 15 winter MTB boots.  I could probably ride with even my ape-sized heavy snow boots. My regular tennis shoes are size 13 and they easily fit with the strap in the shortest adjustment hole.  Did I mention these straps are long?
2.  I had to drill my pedal reflector mounting holes to 13/64"" so the screws would fit.  Not a big deal since the material is aluminum and there was enough ""collar"" around the hole, but check your pedals first to see if a 13/64 bit fits through the hole, and if it doesn't plan to substitute your own hardware or make sure drilling won't cause a problem.  These screws are much larger diameter than any pedal reflector stud I've ever attached.","Nice design, did some custom work",False,
B0011ZH312,5.0,"But not quite. They do not provide the feeling of solid connection to the pedals that a clipless pedal/shoe combination gives. On the other hand, they are more versatile - you can wear any kind of shoe with these; dress shoes, cowboy boots, sneakers, whatever. They do have to be adjusted precisely to fit the particular shoe you are using, and changing shoes may require readjustment. The idea is that as you rotate your foot into pedaling position, the straps should tighten just enough to hold the shoe onto the pedal, but not be so tight as to make it difficult or impossible to keep your foot parallel to the bicycle.

They are also challenging to get into, as their weight turns the pedal exactly 180 degrees from where you need it to be for easy entry - but it's no more difficult than old-style toe clips and straps, or those strapless toe clips that no one seems to use anymore. They would probably work well on a recumbent, where you could enter them from underneath instead of trying to flip them over from the top - especially difficult on a fixed gear where the pedal is moving. Also, the straps have to be mounted on ""quill"" pedals - there is no way to attach them to the molded plastic pedals so many bicycles have today.

Correctly adjusted, they do hold you on to the pedals well. The feeling of ""looseness"" can be remedied by using bicycling shoes with the cleats removed; these generally are tighter and stiffer than street shoes, but then you lose the benefit of being able to wear shoes you can walk around in when you reach your destination.

B0011ZH312,1.0,"If you can afford ~$45 for new pedals, and ~$80 for shoes, just do that instead.  It simply works much better.  Installing the pedals is easy, and the various cleat systems work well and are easy to learn.  Much better use of money than an awkward half measure like this.

I never got these fully working, the screw to adjust the strap jammed on one so while I could play with them a little, they never got properly installed.  The build quality felt poor.  On the problem strap, even when tightened, it would slip when you turned your foot.  The grips were difficult to get in and out of, I would not feel comfortable riding with these in traffic.  The problem is worsened if you have teeth on your pedals, which will act in concert with the strap to keep your shoe in.  By contrast, I have never had issue getting out of my SPD pedals quickly.

While being able to apply power on the upstroke is very valuable, I wouldn't want to install these on anything more than an exercycle.","Couldn't install, didn't look like it was worth trying again",True,

The Power Grips Extra Long Strap Set is the right size if you ride a mountain bike wearing military boots or any type of larger, rugged use boots.

If you already own and have installed the standard length Power Grips on your bike, there is no need to uninstall those in order to install and use the Long Straps.  Simply install the Long Straps on the opposite end of each pedal using some of the existing hardware and screws. If your present nuts are all metal and are not plastic-based locknuts, use Loctite thread locker on the screw and nut to help prevent the hardware from loosening (use the light-duty version of Loctite).  Make sure you use a zip tie (or para cord) to tie down the power grip that you are NOT using on your mission  or ride.  If you do not, your pedal may get snagged by a brush or obstruction while pedaling off-road and get injured.

Now, with both sized Power Grips on your mountain bike, you are ready to ride with less protective shoes for leisure, and ready to ride with more protective military boots for duty use--or as part of your Bug Out gear on your mountain bike!

I have a $300 pair of Sidi's and look pedals that I've used for 10+ years, but for this type of on/off the bike touring, I wanted something that would be easy and comfortable on and off the bike.  This setup was perfect.  One would think, if you buy into the whole pedaling efficiency thing, that I could not climb as well or ride as fast or efficient, but I can tell you that I did not miss a step, and I was very comfortable on/off the bike.  While other folks were fumbling around in there shoes at rest stops, I was walking around like normal.  There were very few people that passed me on the flats or on the hills, and like I said, I had no problems on the bike.  After my experience with the Power Grips, it has changed my entire perspective of pedaling.  When clipped in we have the perception that we are pulling up, when the reality is that we do that very little.  There is research on the net that shows that professional cyclists pull up a very small percentage of the time, and these guys are the best in the world.  What we actually do is pull back, and with the PGs you are able to do this (once setup for your shoes) quite well.  I have also made several fast club rides and had no problem beating and keeping up with the same folks as I do with my Sidi/Look combination.  There may be a bit of loss of efficiency, and if I were racing in a Crit or something where I had to hammer hard, I would most likely switch back, but for the type of riding most everyone who is reading this does, you will not miss a beat.  There is also some good information on this topic on the Rivendell and Sheldon Brown websites that may be worth your time.  All I can say is that I'm a believer.",Great for Touring,True,4
B0011ZH312,5.0,I have used power grips for years and like them very much.  The exta long is great for various types of shoes that commuters and recreational cyclists use these days.  There is a bit too much length for me but these are very easy to trim.,The extra length makes the difference,True,
B0011ZH312,5.0,"These nifty straps are super easy to install.  It took me 10-15 for the first one, 5 minutes for the second.  Ingenious and a thousand times better and more comfortable than the old-fashioned metal cages. I bought these for my husband who hasn't ridden a bike in 25 years.  He has started bicycle commuting recently and I didn't think it would be a good idea to go right to clip in pedals and besides, he wanted to wear regular street shoes.  Only one little fall at the beginning until he got the hang of them.  He loves them, says they are super easy to get in and out of, and they seem to be holding up well to daily use for the past few months.  A very good purchase, recommend highly.",simple pedal straps,True,
B0011ZH312,5.0,"I have had a set of Power Grips straps for over a year now, and I'm very pleased. I have used SPD and TIME and LOOK strapless pedals also.  This is my favorite device for pedaling in standard shoes (usually Chrome messenger shoes, soccer shoes, or cheap BMX sneakers). I like these for the hands-free interface. (Flip the pedal up with the ball of the foot, insert shoe at a slight outward angle, and twist to normal position). You can easily adjust tension WHILE RIDING by simply turning your foot outward a little and shifting your foot back or forward on the pedal, so that when straight, the foot is wrapped more or less tightly by the band. I like the hipster-style exercise-bike looking dual-velcro straps also, but this is a cheaper option and well suited to beginners, exercise riders, touring riders, road racers who can't or won't use strapless pedal/SPD.","Simple, cheap, effective, perfect for retro grouches",False,
B0011ZH312,4.0,"I really like these Power Grip straps; they work surprisingly well to fix your foot to the pedal in lieu of toe clips and straps. As others have noted, they are pricey; however $20 for the standard version is still within reason, as a quality set of toe clips and straps will run you at least twice that much.

Are they well priced? Well, maybe not. Are they a pragmatic, economical solution compared to other options? Certainly.

In any event, they work great. I originally bought the extra-long strap set, thinking that I may need to use them to accommodate my boots, however I do not recommend them. I work in a job that essentially requires boots, and they're the only pair of shoes I really own anyway, so I wear them all the time. I really didn't like the construction of the extra long strap; it's not one contiguous strap, but rather two straps stitched together. I wasn't too confident in their construction, but they're made of a very heavy fiber and I figure they're fine, but not at all attractive. Perplexingly, the extra long straps use the same mounting system but a totally different system of adjustment, using pre-punched holes and screws rather than a simple retaining nut.

I like the system on the original straps as it's more finely adjustable. I never actually adjusted mine anyway; after taking them on a 30 mile trail I loosened them sufficiently that my feet slid into them comfortably. I found that my size 10 Timberland boots fit into the original strap set just fine, and will be returning the extra-long straps (which I might add are $10 more for just a couple of inches of cloth).

You'll have to get used to using them, though. I find that the best way to work with them is to stand over the top tube of your bike while keeping one foot permanently lodged within the strap, with the pedal rotated 45 degrees to the forward from the top. Then just stand on the pedal and in one smooth motion lift yourself onto the seat, and while slowly moving forward from the lift, slot your other foot into the other pedal. It's a lot faster and more convenient than dismounting completely and having to fit your feet back into both.",Bang for the Buck,True,
B0011ZH312,4.0,"I am new to road biking and didn't want to invesnt in ""clipless"" pedals and shoes given I ride my bike to and from the gym alot but I found the baskets I bought to be really flimsy and I broke a few sets of those so I found these and I am pretty happy. They don't take long to install maybe 10 mins if your competent or 20 mins for me. They arrive in a somewhat confusing package and I found myself kinda having to rig em to work with my pedals but I they should fit almost any steel pedal with little to no modification. They look pretty good but its obvious you have something on there that most people don't.

On my first run out with these I found myself stopping every mile or so to make little adjustments to the straps, they are very much adjustable just lip the ""strap"" further or pull it out more and holds pretty securely just make sure and snug it up with the allen wrench. I have pretty massive feet 13,W and these fit but not much room is left so they would be perfect for most people. I also love how thick they are. I was pretty concernd when I bought them because when starting off and getting your foot in you may drag them a little but these are soo durable you will probably never wear them out and if you do maybe its worth it to invest in the clipless.

Getting into them isn't the easist thing to do on the move. It requires good bit of moving your food around to get it secure but once your in you don't come out on accident, so there is a nice feeling of security but you don't ever feel like your foot is stuck should something happen,

All in all pretty solid, not expensive and with a few mods and a little shaking down they work great. For what they are I wouldnt imagine being much happier. One thing I would like however is the option for HIGH VIS markings or something. I had to remove my pedal reflectors and while I have lights on my bike would be nice they had something that came standard with the kit to replace it. They do make a kit but im not worried enough about it to pay the extra 20 bucks",Pretty solid,True,
B0011ZH312,4.0,"You pretty much have to guess how to make the final connection of the strap to the mounting bracket on each pedal.  The illustration shows only a single view and is vaguely phrased.
Power Grips have been around for a couple or three DECADES with hardly any changes.  Instead of a series of holes like a belt, the straps now are continuously variable in length to fit various shoe widths.
The concept was brilliant, whoever thought it up: tough, broad straps mounted diagonally across the pedal to enable the rider to exert power on the ""pull"" stroke but allow her or him to withdraw the foot quickly in case the bicycle is about to tip over.  It also means the foot can be inserted under the straps, then tightened, without using the hands.

For those who ride on city streets, with traffic and stop lights to contend with, these are an excellent solution.",Still the most versatile - poor instructions,True,
B0011ZH312,5.0,"I have problems with my right leg(Dorsiflexion)so ""I"" can't move foot up. With ""Power grips"" it gives me the extra hold on the peddle. They're great!
I had to get the extra large strips for my size 11.5 shoe.
Installation was easy, the biggest problem was I kept dropping the tiny nut that holds on the ""power grips"", no big deal!! I should of used needle nose pliers.
I put them on the peddles befroe I put the peddles on the bike. (I could see it being a pain the rear, if the peddles were on the bike already.) I also slipped my shoes into them a few times to get the right size ""loop"". No problem and a brilliant idea if I say so myself! HA!
Down the road I'm might have to adjust them tighter them after I get used to them, but it shouldn't be a problem
These are going to last for a LONG time, the material is tough and rigid enough for the loop to stay open. It's easy to slip your feet into them, and I had to stop suddenly and getting out of them was no problem!
I was using ""clipless"" before and I'll be using these for years to come.

Also because of my Dorsiflexion, these keep my feet centered on the peddle.
These are a good, you might think they are a little expensive, but the material and peddles are tough!

B0011ZH312,4.0,"just looks ""different"" & works the same...Attaches the same to standard pedaels too. No ""special shoes"" needs either.

I wanted a replacement pair in womens' small and this was what I found. However these are not the gloves I used to have. These are way too bulky with huge inside seams that hurt my wrist and between my fingers. The padding compromises control and makes my hands sweat. The fingers are too long and padded, I can barely bend my fingers. The wrist wrap is stiff and bulgy so I can't wear my heart rate monitor on the outside of the glove. The only good thing is that, if you wrap it tightly, the glove does offer good wrist support, but mobility is lost in the whole hand in general. I wouldn't get these gloves again. I liked the old Harbinger wrist wrap gloves much better. I have only used these twice so maybe they'll break in and feel better soon.",Too Bulky,True,14

It doesn't fold up much smaller than the $10 chairs you get at Costco and It's not super comfortable. If it was a lot smaller I would say it's good for camping, but that fact that it's close to the same size, I would save your money. I ended up taking my regular folding chair camping so I would be more comfortable. The only thing smaller is the seat. I'm 6'2'' 200lbs.",Not much smaller than regular size folding chairs,True,2.0
B00140Y4JS,3.0,"I bought this from a local store (thus not verified here). I'm surprised how cheap it is because it feels like great quality. I am under 5', female with a petite build, so there aren't many chairs like this that won't suit me.

I bought this and the Helinox Swivel Chair because an in-store comparison wouldn't do. I asked co-workers to try both. Two ladies in skirts preferred the Quick-E-Seat (QES). A man about my height preferred the Helinox Swivel (HS).

The purpose for me is waiting in a long line outdoors. I usually just stand but figured, why not get a chair?

The QES folds and unfolds immediately. Even as short as I am, with the strap on my shoulder, it's off the ground and okay to carry. It feels very sturdy to me and seems easy to move along when a line starts moving. I also feel higher above ground than those low-seated options.

The HS is good on even ground only. It requires a relatively easy but tent-like assembly/disassembly, and sits low. The pros are that if sitting for hours, it's likely more relaxing (sit back, swivel, body support). But when it's time to put it away, you have to allow time and have space to disassemble. I am not sure how that would work if there's a large, fast-moving crowd.

The key for me is about what I can carry into the venue once the line waiting is over.

For me, that would be the HS which is lighter and folds into a bag. At a place where I'm getting a product and walking out -- the QES will do. But if I'm going to a Broadway show where space is limited, the HS is much more suited.

Considering the price, I will likely keep both. No big deal. But for the line waiting, I'm undecided at the time of this review.",Waiting In Line: Comparison,False,

Other chairs take awhile to pack it up and put inside the bag holder to use the carry on strap and it weight 3 times as much.

B00140Y4JS,4.0,"Originally I bought this to sit on while in a fixed position while hunting with others, instead of standing in the cold moving back and forth on my feet to keep them reasonably warm. It could also be used on a tree stand, depending upon the design and size of tyhe platform.

It is easy to fold and unfold, light weight and be in reasonable but basic comfortable for the design. It has a bag to store it in and carry it. Remember, this is not designed to lean back on and relax. It is designed to be a convenience to allow temproary sitting. It could also be used for sitting at an outdoor concert or any other outside activity where you might prefer being able to sit instead of stand.

The only drawback, although I understand due to its design size, is that it is a little small for my size (6'2 / 210lbs). It would be more functional and comfortable for a smaller person. I also have a larger one of a different design which fits my size better.

B00140Y4JS,4.0,My fiance wanted a small chair with a back to take on his backpacking camping trip in the summer and fall. I searched for quite awhile to find a chair that would fit his demands.

B00140Y4JS,4.0,I have used this chair on two deployments so far and it has held up well. It has had some light tearing around where the seat attaches to the posts but other than that it is still holding up well. I am an average size guy at 6' 1' and 180 lbs. If you sit in it too long though your crotch will go to sleep due to how the seat is shaped. If you are only going to sit in it for shorter periods of time it is great or for tight spaces. But if you are going to lounge around in it for hours I would buy a bigger chair.

B00140Y4JS,2.0,"The problem with this chair is not that it is too flimsy to hold a lot of weight. In fact I found it to be more sound structurally than others have written.

So far i love it. its super comfortable for its size. as a guy, the front post can sometimes feel like a bike seat, but a big bike seat at that. if my groin area starts to feel pressure i just adjust or sit in the chair more properly. i have even found the chair to be comfortable sitting in it sideways. it was kinda pricey at 30 bucks at dicks sporting goods, but its well worth it. its made from quality material and won't rip like the others.

B00140Y4JS,4.0,"Sturdy, I first saw these at a big box store and sat in it.  The back support m,akes a huge difference.  The triangular ones that have no back support -- and I think this same company makes that one, too -- is nowhere near as comfortable.  So, if you are debating with or without the back support, pay more for the support.

Construction is good, does fold up very well, and is quite comfortable.  I'm only 169 lbs, 5' 9"" though, so if you're a big person, you might want to find one at a store and try it first. It is much quicker and smaller than the ""bag chairs"", and I could use this for extended time, such as at a ballgame.  It's likely heavier, though, than you'd want to bring on a hiking  or backpacking trip (estimate 3 lbs) and if you are car camping, you'd likely want a real, solid chair (like a director's style chair).

Two small notes:  this does not have a bag to put it in.  A bag might have been tidy, but it does go into a small size without it, but it sort of opens up when you lift it, so a bag would have been nice.  And second, keep in mind that it's legs are close together, and if you use it on a soft surface (damp dirt, etc.), it'll push in far to the ground because your weight is over it.  It does not have a wide base of support from legs that extend beyond the chair itself; the legs are only directly under the chair.  I have no issue toppling over in it, but the legs are not splayed like a bag chair, so you could never, for instance, use this on the beach unless you bring it to hard, wet sand maybe.

I have purchased numerous types of different Bokken (Practice Bokken Samurai Long Sword-Katana) for my Samurai Aerobics classes. They have been made from various types of wood as well as some hard plastic models.  This model (40 foam rubber practice Bokken) I found to be a very good practice Bokken for the price.

Even though this is a wooden Bokken covered by rubber, it really is not designed to practice full contact training.  This is where some of the previous reviewers may have been mistaken, thinking the foam rubber covering would make it a good contact training weapon.  I personally thought this Bokken was fairly durable and rugged in my sword classes.  We would practice 100s of cuts and slashes as well as kata using this rubber covered Bokken.  We even had some light contact but not full power strikes (We would use a Kendo sword for full contact) with this model. One other thing, the rubber makes the grip very solid when practicing the cuts, slashes and combination techniques.

In conclusion, if you are seeking a fairly balanced foam rubber Bokken to practice your cuts, thrusts and kata with, you may want to check out this model.

B000WCOBJW,5.0,"I've been impressed with everything about this watch since receiving it.  First off, the looks are great.  It's a large watch, but the styling is nicely done and it looks decent on my average size wrist. I like that it is not bold or busy. It is fairly intuitive to adjust and access the many functions. The three major functions of the watch are easily accessed from the corresponding buttons on the right side.

I particularly like that this is a solar powered watch, with a handy indicator at the bottom of the display showing the level of charge.  It took a week or so of normal wear to fully charge the battery, but it has maintained it's full charge with only a minimal amount of direct sunlight daily.  The owner's manual states that with normal use it needs only 5 minutes of sunlight daily to maintain the charge, and it has so far proven true.

The compass function appears to be quite accurate, but I haven't used it very much so far.  The compass will shut off after about 20 seconds, I assume to save battery power.

For an accurate temperature reading the watch must be removed from the wrist.  Your body heat will affect the reading significantly, but that is to be expected with this type of thermometer.  Once removed from the wrist, it will take at least 15 minutes for the temperature to stabilize.  I suppose that unless you have the watch sitting on your nightstand or you are in the middle of nowhere, there are probably quicker ways to find the actual temperature.

The barometer seems fairly accurate when compared to the local pressure reading from the nearby government weather station.  The trend graph is a nice touch.  I haven't used the altimeter much but it's important to note that it must be adjusted periodically to match your actual elevation, as with any altimeter the reading is computed against the ever-changing barometric pressure.

The atomic time keeping has worked very well for my location in the central US.  I live approximately 550 miles from the Ft. Collins transmitter, and the watch will receive the time signal each night when it is removed from my wrist and sitting on my nightstand.  I've stayed up late enough to notice that it does have some problem receiving a signal while I am wearing it, but that is expected as stated in the product manual.

Since the intended use of the major functions is in an outdoor/adventure type of environment, then this watch adequately fits the bill.  For me it just makes a great, good looking daily wear watch.",Feature Filled Timepiece,False,43

I had one of the first Pathfinder's and that thing was like a deck of cards strapped to my wrist.  This much newer model is not much bigger than a normal sports watch.  I tested the altimeter and the altimeter recording function while mountain biking, and it performed great.  I've used the compass just for giggles, not for navigation, but it seems to work great too.  The barometer is about the only thing I haven't tested, but it always turns on and gives a reading.  Of all those awesome tools, my most favorite is the timer.  I set it to 25 minutes when I go on break at work and I never have to check what time it is; I just go back when it goes off.  Because of that, I also know that the buttons can withstand several presses a day without shorting out.

B000WCOBJW,3.0,"First, let me say that it is a rather dangerous notion that anyone would take a non-GPS wristwatch seriously enough to depend on it for any legitimate use. These watches are not much more than techno bling.

PROS:
It's a techno-gadget and gadgets are fun. Looks decent, tells the time and date well. Solar and atomic time are excellent features and work well for me in the northern US.

CONS:
The Compass is inaccurate. I calibrated it by the manual. But often it thinks South is North. You could end up dead with that kind of inaccuracy.
UPDATE: After performing a northerly calibration about 10 or 20 times, it now seems to know which way is North. I still have no idea why the thing kept reading 180 degrees off previously. Regardless, I'd only use this compass to find a general heading. In NO WAY would I ever use this compass with a map in a legitimate situation.

The Altimeter is inaccurate. I set the base value to zero in my driveway, drive around all day, and when I return home it measures anywhere from -40' on one day to 200' another day. In fact, I can calibrate it to zero in my living room, come back 10 minutes later, and it will not be at zero. That being the case, how can anyone expect to climb a mountain and return with any kind of accurate data about their trek? Elevation alone isn't much use for hiking if you don't also know the distance you've traveled. An altimeter would seem more useful to an airplane pilot who only needs an altitude figure. However, the instructions advise against using the watch for such a purpose. So an altimeter on a watch doesn't seem very useful. You really need GPS for elevation over distance traveled. I'd prefer the graph to be shown in the largest portion of the screen so I can see the terrain as I cover it, with the number at the top of the screen and the time of day at the bottom. The way this watch records and stores Altimeter data boggles the mind- scrolling through records and pages of data and trying to delete this information has been a lesson in futility for me.

The Barometer is decent. It seems accurate to within 5 something-or-others. When it says 29.95 I get the same reading from my smart phone's weather report. But again, i'd much prefer to see the bar graph in the large portion of the screen, with the actual number at the top and the time of day at the bottom. It's been showing a steady trend downward for over 36 hours today, but no bad weather in sight by any local weather reports. Has no alert for approaching bad weather. One must consider the value of this compared to a weather rock outside one's window sill, where if the rock is wet, you can be sure it's raining.

Thermometer: let's face it, we're sporting a device whose sole purpose is to be worn on the body. Why should we have to remove it each time we want to see the ambient temperature? They can't fix this at this point in technological history?

The backlight, still, ridiculously shuts off after only 1 second, pissing me off every time. It makes sense to have this be user-adjustable on this watch, since: there's a lot more to look at than the current time, and this watch is rechargeable, so power usage isn't a real concern.

Illogical button navigation: let me tell you a very logical secret: UP should INcrement and DOWN should DEcrement. But this watch is backward, like so many Casios. By what logic should the top button decrement and the bottom button increment? Answer: only if you were to take the watch off your wrist and hold it in front of you with the band set horizontally left to right. But on the wrist all watches are viewed as though 12:00 were north. So the up/down buttons are annoying.

One more: why can't the date read like most other Casios? Why can't I have: ""Mon. 02.27""? Nobody needs to read the current year. I need a glance at which day of the week today is, which month we're in (for when the month rolls over every 30-ish days), and the number of day today is within the month. But this most useful feature is missing!

This watch looks ok, though rather plain.

Let's put this watch and others of its non-GPS kind in context: the MFRP is 300 US dollars. You can get one HECK of an awesome and accurate hiking GPS unit for that much with cash left over for accessories. I only bought mine because it was 50% off on sale. Moreover, GPS watches are beginning to appear in the 200-500 range, and the features of those things blow these ABC watches in the dust for not all that much more.

ABC watches are outdated, horribly inaccurate and lack some of the most basic logic on a techno watch, such as backlight timeout and button logic.

I'd buy these ABC watches for under 150 bucks, just for the gadgetry of it. But for real outdoor tracking, it's a FAR wiser investment to go with a real GPS device. Even better to bring a manual compass and map.","Non-GPS Watches are illegitimate, but fun novelty",False,4
B000WCOBJW,4.0,"I purchased this as my only watch I own with the hope that it will be the only watch I ever have to purchase again.  I haven't been able to test many of its claims to durability and shock-proof-ness, but it seems very rugged.  The material the band is made of seems like it is very durable.  It feels somewhat rubbery, but it's not uncomfortable, grips your wrist and shouldn't be uncomfortable when wet.

I really like the way it pretty much automatically does everything for you.  It keeps graphs of most of its data, which is neat and helpful in a watch.  I wouldn't rely on it as my ONLY compass, though.

It took a couple of days to find the signal for auto-time keeping, but setting the time zone it was accurate even without that.  (not docking points for this, as I didn't do the manual calibration, and I pretty much had it near everything it said NOT to have it near when calibrating, TV's, large metal objects, electronics, not keeping it near a window, etc)

B000WCOBJW,5.0,"i have owned this watch for maayyybe five years.  it is a tank!  i am a bowhunter, i am a backpacker, and i am a fisherman.  and for the entire time of ownership, i have been an engineer building a tunnel underground.  my watch has had a hard, hard life.  i've worn this watch several times traveling to 3rd world countries.  and it has never missed a beat.  only once, while working in this dark, wet tunnel has the battery indicator gone to the middle setting. i quick rest on a sunny windowsill fully charged it back up and it has been on high ever since.

recently the band pin broke.  i cobbled it together for a few months with a pin that almost fits.  eventually, two attempts later, if failed for good.  i sadly put the broken watch away and picked up an analog casio from Costco.  (nice watch too!).

i thought it was over.  no more atomic accuracy..no more ABC buttons.  damn.  on a whim i sent it in to casio repair.  they sent me notification that my watch can be fixed for $14 + $8 shipping.  woohoo!!  i authorized the repair and they sent it back in three days.  strapping that watch on was like seeing an old friend again. looking at the bill, it was expensive because all they did was replace ONE of the pins. the band and other pin are still the old ones.  wish they would have simply given me two new pins and a new band.  might go another five years.

i love this thing.  not to expensive, so if some pickpocket on some island takes it from me..  and damn accurate.  i love meeting others with similar timepieces and seeing the time synced up the the exact second.  i live in San Francisco, so the atomic syncing can be hit/miss.  mostly hits.  when i got it back from repairs it had been months since it last synced.  i had a hard time manually syncing the time, but it got easier in the evening.  it has connected every night since.

one day, i will own some mega money chronograph.  but i will always have a pathfinder on my ""hard"" trips.  mine is scratched and worn down looking, but the face is nice and clear.  my wife bought it from amazon for my birthday.  great gift.  i am wearing it now.  on high elevation hikes, it is not reading the same elevation as my brother's Suunto.  who know which is correct?  who cares.  the temp tells you some random temp average of your wrist and the ambient temp.  taking it off will give you a good reading, but could result in a lost watch.  i don't do it.

This Pathfinder is slimmer and more stylish than my last one.  The display is gorgeous and easier to read.  Time-syncing from California seems to be even more reliable, too.  I don't often use the barometer or temperature features, but I use the compass and it works great.

B000WCOBJW,3.0,"I ordered this watch 2 days ago for $195.00 through Amazon ""Prime"". I received it today and I see that the price is now $164.95. I decided to return it for that reason alone however, I am at 6 feet above sea level and the altimeter on the watch says I'm at -320 feet. I calibrated the barometer and now I'm only 300 feet below sea level. This is absolutely unacceptable for a watch of this type in this price range. The thermometer seems to be fairly accurate if you leave it off of your wrist for 30 minutes and it probably keeps time well. I would probably keep it if Amazon would credit me the difference ($35.00)and see if I could find out why the altimeter is so whacked but there is no provision for that in the ""returns"" page here on Amazon. Oh well... BTW I had a similar solar powered, ""atomic"" Casio watch a few years back that the light quit working after about 2 years so I was excited about getting this one. As I said, ""oh well"".

B000WCOBJW,4.0,"This watch does everything it's advertised to do, but you almost have to carry the huge users manual with you to be able to use all of the functions it has. I've had it for over a month and still am not familiar with how to do everything. It keeps excellent time. When I first opened the box it was a bit off and set to the wrong time, but the next morning after it picked up its time signal, it was to the second what the time standard on-line was giving. The altimeter varies quite a bit with barometric pressure, so your absolute elevation will change from day to day. I live at 79 ft above sea level according to the local marker, but the watch has read anywhere from 40 to 280 ft. The stopwatch function is a little difficult to read in the decimal fractions as those digits are in the upper part of the display, and are much smaller than the seconds digits. The only thing I really wish was different is the band. It's much longer than the bands on any other watch I've had, and could easily go around my ankle (I weigh ~155), which leaves quite a bit of excess band sticking out.

B000WCOBJW,2.0,"I am a fan of Casios. Although inexpensive they are among the most accurate and reliable timepices you can get.

This one breaks the mold. To begin with, mine did not keep time very well.  It could lose 10s of seconds a day.  I don't know how this is possible in a quartz watch but I saw it lose time against several other atomic clocks.

The altimeter/barometer is a flawed concept to begin with.  When you are climbing outdoors the reported pressure falls and the calculated altitude rises either because you are climbing or because the barometric pressure is falling or both, you can't tell.  The reported numbers can swing up and down by a hundred feet or so for no reason.  You have inaccurate reporting of an unknown mix of variables. Almost useless information.

Likewise, the temperature reported is not the temperature of your body or of your surroundings, but something in between, a useless number.

You can buy a much more accurate and useful compass for $20.00 at any store that sells them.

Altimeter is very handy when in the mountains, climbing 14,000' peaks in Colorado and skiing.

Barometer/temp is useful when on those 14ers to tell if the weather is changing quickly on you.

Compass does a great job of getting you in the right direction without having to have a separate device.

Atomic Clock updates keep you on the correct time all the time!

5 Alarm settings are very helpful (they will always go off based on your 'home time' zone, so an 8:00 am alarm on the west coast will sound at 11:00 am on the east coast.

Features other discussed that I will comment on.

1.  Thermometer or the barometer is very accurate, but I had to calibrate it 8-10 degree less.  It is also more accurate if it is off your wrist for a period of time.

B000WCOBJW,5.0,"I have a ton of Casio watches, including three old alti-barometer watches.  When this series came out, I waited a while and then jumped on it.  It has everything one could want.  Well, it does everything it says it should, and very well.  However, after about one year of use, I'm running into problems.  I fly for a living, and this is the watch I take with me.  I usually go to Europe five times a month and I wear this watch, when I'm home in the US this watch sits by a window to charge up and receive the atomic clock.
Well, the watch makes it to Europe, but on the return, it usually dies on me.  It goes from battery High indication to a dead screen with a flashing ""C"", meaning it went into power saver mode trying to recharge.  At this point it loses all information - time, date, altimeter settings etc...  The other day it started flashing an ""R"" and froze up.  Haven't found that in the manual yet.  But I'm giving up on it.  A watch is no good if it can't reliably show the time, and this one doesn't do that.
My guess is that the rechargeable battery is dead.  The watch is out of warranty now, so I'm on my own with it.  I found a place online that sells these rechargeable batteries, I guess I could give that a try.  Still, disappointing, you would think a solar watch would work a whole lot longer than a regular battery.

Edit:

I bought a new rechargeable battery for nine dollars from a NY online store and changed it myself.  The watch works perfectly now and hasn't dipped below a ""High"" charge since and that has been about a year.  It has taken a lot of abuse in the last two years and still works great although the plastic on the sides is pretty scuffed.  I changed the rating to a five star rating now since it works as it should.  Still not pleased that Casio sent it out with a bad battery.  By the way, it does receive the German and British time signals perfectly.  Haven't tried the Japanese one yet.  It is a little annoying that the watch needs to be told that it is in a different country though, rather than scanning for a signal by itself.  I usually don't bother since the watch is accurate enough for a while without updating.  Like most Casio's, it runs fast a few seconds every month if it doesn't update.

Update October 2011:

It is now a few years later.  The watch still runs on the replacement rechargeable battery I bought and replaced back then and it's still always on ""High"".  It was definitely a bad battery I got from Casio.  The watch itself is holding up well.  The silver is starting to scratch off a little bit which makes it look not so pretty.

Once you get them installed, one thing you should know is that it is practically impossible to use these if you wear running or hiking shoes, or any other type of shoe that has pronounced track patterns in the sole. The reason is that the sole track catches on the pedal itself, which makes it very hard to slip your foot in, and twice as hard to pull it out. Keep in mind that when you install these straps, you can no longer simply place your foot on the pedal... You have to slip/slide it in and out.

At one point all the guys I was riding with went to clipless pedals. I am not sure they were happier with them (they crashed a little at first with the clipless :-o). Clipless pedals did not make them faster up the hills than me.  Power grips allow me to choose to wear the shoes/hiking boots I like, and not be limited by what is compatable with my pedal. This is important to me. I like to find a lightweight hiking boot that has a very stiff sole to use with these most of the time, but they work fine with my regular athletic shoes for quick trips around the neighborhood.

On the positive side, i really enjoyed being able to pull up, and I felt good that my feet weren't going to slip off the pedals. The reason that I tightened the straps after two weeks is that my shoes were going a bit too far into the straps, and I was worried that would make it harder to get out of the straps quickly.

B0011ZH312,4.0,"This is a review of Power Grips 375mm written on 15 June 2014.  I have not received and will not accept any compensation or discount for writing this review or trying the product.  I am not employed by any manufacturer, distributor or retailer of anything.

I used plastic toe clips for over a decade so these were easy to get used to.  I just switched to dual pedals:  cleat on one side and platform on the other, so the plastic clips wouldn't work any more for me, which was a problem because I wear street shoes when biking short distances.  Still, for cleat riding I have to strap these up out of the way so they don't scrape on the pavement.  That's a better compromise for me than going no-strap no-clip when I wear street shoes.

Notes:
1.  I got the longer ones.  These straps are long.  I have plenty of room for my size 15 winter MTB boots.  I could probably ride with even my ape-sized heavy snow boots. My regular tennis shoes are size 13 and they easily fit with the strap in the shortest adjustment hole.  Did I mention these straps are long?
2.  I had to drill my pedal reflector mounting holes to 13/64"" so the screws would fit.  Not a big deal since the material is aluminum and there was enough ""collar"" around the hole, but check your pedals first to see if a 13/64 bit fits through the hole, and if it doesn't plan to substitute your own hardware or make sure drilling won't cause a problem.  These screws are much larger diameter than any pedal reflector stud I've ever attached.","Nice design, did some custom work",False,
B0011ZH312,5.0,"But not quite. They do not provide the feeling of solid connection to the pedals that a clipless pedal/shoe combination gives. On the other hand, they are more versatile - you can wear any kind of shoe with these; dress shoes, cowboy boots, sneakers, whatever. They do have to be adjusted precisely to fit the particular shoe you are using, and changing shoes may require readjustment. The idea is that as you rotate your foot into pedaling position, the straps should tighten just enough to hold the shoe onto the pedal, but not be so tight as to make it difficult or impossible to keep your foot parallel to the bicycle.

They are also challenging to get into, as their weight turns the pedal exactly 180 degrees from where you need it to be for easy entry - but it's no more difficult than old-style toe clips and straps, or those strapless toe clips that no one seems to use anymore. They would probably work well on a recumbent, where you could enter them from underneath instead of trying to flip them over from the top - especially difficult on a fixed gear where the pedal is moving. Also, the straps have to be mounted on ""quill"" pedals - there is no way to attach them to the molded plastic pedals so many bicycles have today.

Correctly adjusted, they do hold you on to the pedals well. The feeling of ""looseness"" can be remedied by using bicycling shoes with the cleats removed; these generally are tighter and stiffer than street shoes, but then you lose the benefit of being able to wear shoes you can walk around in when you reach your destination. Nevertheless, Power Grips are an acceptable compromise between clipless and open platform pedals.",Almost as good as clipless,False,
B0011ZH312,3.0,"these are good to use as a transition between platform and clipless pedals.

Getting them to mount to Platform pedals is a chore and you have to make sure the pedals have a flat vertical edge for the screws to go through or they won't work.  Only put 50ish miles on them so far so still getting used to the motion, but don't feel like my foot is gonna stay in when I'm cart wheeling (which I'm very good at), compared to a clip-less pedal.",Like them !!,True,
B0011ZH312,1.0,"If you can afford ~$45 for new pedals, and ~$80 for shoes, just do that instead.  It simply works much better.  Installing the pedals is easy, and the various cleat systems work well and are easy to learn.  Much better use of money than an awkward half measure like this.

I never got these fully working, the screw to adjust the strap jammed on one so while I could play with them a little, they never got properly installed.  The build quality felt poor.  On the problem strap, even when tightened, it would slip when you turned your foot.  The grips were difficult to get in and out of, I would not feel comfortable riding with these in traffic.  The problem is worsened if you have teeth on your pedals, which will act in concert with the strap to keep your shoe in.  By contrast, I have never had issue getting out of my SPD pedals quickly.

While being able to apply power on the upstroke is very valuable, I wouldn't want to install these on anything more than an exercycle.","Couldn't install, didn't look like it was worth trying again",True,

The Power Grips Extra Long Strap Set is the right size if you ride a mountain bike wearing military boots or any type of larger, rugged use boots.

If you already own and have installed the standard length Power Grips on your bike, there is no need to uninstall those in order to install and use the Long Straps.  Simply install the Long Straps on the opposite end of each pedal using some of the existing hardware and screws. If your present nuts are all metal and are not plastic-based locknuts, use Loctite thread locker on the screw and nut to help prevent the hardware from loosening (use the light-duty version of Loctite).  Make sure you use a zip tie (or para cord) to tie down the power grip that you are NOT using on your mission  or ride.  If you do not, your pedal may get snagged by a brush or obstruction while pedaling off-road and get injured.

Now, with both sized Power Grips on your mountain bike, you are ready to ride with less protective shoes for leisure, and ready to ride with more protective military boots for duty use--or as part of your Bug Out gear on your mountain bike!

I have a $300 pair of Sidi's and look pedals that I've used for 10+ years, but for this type of on/off the bike touring, I wanted something that would be easy and comfortable on and off the bike.  This setup was perfect.  One would think, if you buy into the whole pedaling efficiency thing, that I could not climb as well or ride as fast or efficient, but I can tell you that I did not miss a step, and I was very comfortable on/off the bike.  While other folks were fumbling around in there shoes at rest stops, I was walking around like normal.  There were very few people that passed me on the flats or on the hills, and like I said, I had no problems on the bike.  After my experience with the Power Grips, it has changed my entire perspective of pedaling.  When clipped in we have the perception that we are pulling up, when the reality is that we do that very little.  There is research on the net that shows that professional cyclists pull up a very small percentage of the time, and these guys are the best in the world.  What we actually do is pull back, and with the PGs you are able to do this (once setup for your shoes) quite well.  I have also made several fast club rides and had no problem beating and keeping up with the same folks as I do with my Sidi/Look combination.  There may be a bit of loss of efficiency, and if I were racing in a Crit or something where I had to hammer hard, I would most likely switch back, but for the type of riding most everyone who is reading this does, you will not miss a beat.  There is also some good information on this topic on the Rivendell and Sheldon Brown websites that may be worth your time.  All I can say is that I'm a believer.",Great for Touring,True,4

This is my favorite device for pedaling in standard shoes (usually Chrome messenger shoes, soccer shoes, or cheap BMX sneakers). I like these for the hands-free interface. (Flip the pedal up with the ball of the foot, insert shoe at a slight outward angle, and twist to normal position). You can easily adjust tension WHILE RIDING by simply turning your foot outward a little and shifting your foot back or forward on the pedal, so that when straight, the foot is wrapped more or less tightly by the band. I like the hipster-style exercise-bike looking dual-velcro straps also, but this is a cheaper option and well suited to beginners, exercise riders, touring riders, road racers who can't or won't use strapless pedal/SPD.","Simple, cheap, effective, perfect for retro grouches",False,
B0011ZH312,4.0,"I really like these Power Grip straps; they work surprisingly well to fix your foot to the pedal in lieu of toe clips and straps. As others have noted, they are pricey; however $20 for the standard version is still within reason, as a quality set of toe clips and straps will run you at least twice that much.

Are they well priced? Well, maybe not. Are they a pragmatic, economical solution compared to other options? Certainly.

In any event, they work great. I originally bought the extra-long strap set, thinking that I may need to use them to accommodate my boots, however I do not recommend them. I work in a job that essentially requires boots, and they're the only pair of shoes I really own anyway, so I wear them all the time. I really didn't like the construction of the extra long strap; it's not one contiguous strap, but rather two straps stitched together. I wasn't too confident in their construction, but they're made of a very heavy fiber and I figure they're fine, but not at all attractive. Perplexingly, the extra long straps use the same mounting system but a totally different system of adjustment, using pre-punched holes and screws rather than a simple retaining nut.

I like the system on the original straps as it's more finely adjustable. I never actually adjusted mine anyway; after taking them on a 30 mile trail I loosened them sufficiently that my feet slid into them comfortably. I found that my size 10 Timberland boots fit into the original strap set just fine, and will be returning the extra-long straps (which I might add are $10 more for just a couple of inches of cloth).

You'll have to get used to using them, though. I find that the best way to work with them is to stand over the top tube of your bike while keeping one foot permanently lodged within the strap, with the pedal rotated 45 degrees to the forward from the top. Then just stand on the pedal and in one smooth motion lift yourself onto the seat, and while slowly moving forward from the lift, slot your other foot into the other pedal. It's a lot faster and more convenient than dismounting completely and having to fit your feet back into both.",Bang for the Buck,True,
B0011ZH312,4.0,"I am new to road biking and didn't want to invesnt in ""clipless"" pedals and shoes given I ride my bike to and from the gym alot but I found the baskets I bought to be really flimsy and I broke a few sets of those so I found these and I am pretty happy. They don't take long to install maybe 10 mins if your competent or 20 mins for me. They arrive in a somewhat confusing package and I found myself kinda having to rig em to work with my pedals but I they should fit almost any steel pedal with little to no modification. They look pretty good but its obvious you have something on there that most people don't.

On my first run out with these I found myself stopping every mile or so to make little adjustments to the straps, they are very much adjustable just lip the ""strap"" further or pull it out more and holds pretty securely just make sure and snug it up with the allen wrench. I have pretty massive feet 13,W and these fit but not much room is left so they would be perfect for most people. I also love how thick they are. I was pretty concernd when I bought them because when starting off and getting your foot in you may drag them a little but these are soo durable you will probably never wear them out and if you do maybe its worth it to invest in the clipless.

Getting into them isn't the easist thing to do on the move. It requires good bit of moving your food around to get it secure but once your in you don't come out on accident, so there is a nice feeling of security but you don't ever feel like your foot is stuck should something happen,

All in all pretty solid, not expensive and with a few mods and a little shaking down they work great. For what they are I wouldnt imagine being much happier. One thing I would like however is the option for HIGH VIS markings or something. I had to remove my pedal reflectors and while I have lights on my bike would be nice they had something that came standard with the kit to replace it.

Power Grips have been around for a couple or three DECADES with hardly any changes.  Instead of a series of holes like a belt, the straps now are continuously variable in length to fit various shoe widths.
The concept was brilliant, whoever thought it up: tough, broad straps mounted diagonally across the pedal to enable the rider to exert power on the ""pull"" stroke but allow her or him to withdraw the foot quickly in case the bicycle is about to tip over.  It also means the foot can be inserted under the straps, then tightened, without using the hands.

B00140Y4JS,3.0,"I bought this from a local store (thus not verified here). I'm surprised how cheap it is because it feels like great quality. I am under 5', female with a petite build, so there aren't many chairs like this that won't suit me.

I bought this and the Helinox Swivel Chair because an in-store comparison wouldn't do. I asked co-workers to try both. Two ladies in skirts preferred the Quick-E-Seat (QES). A man about my height preferred the Helinox Swivel (HS).

The purpose for me is waiting in a long line outdoors. I usually just stand but figured, why not get a chair?

The QES folds and unfolds immediately. Even as short as I am, with the strap on my shoulder, it's off the ground and okay to carry. It feels very sturdy to me and seems easy to move along when a line starts moving. I also feel higher above ground than those low-seated options.

The HS is good on even ground only. It requires a relatively easy but tent-like assembly/disassembly, and sits low. The pros are that if sitting for hours, it's likely more relaxing (sit back, swivel, body support). But when it's time to put it away, you have to allow time and have space to disassemble. I am not sure how that would work if there's a large, fast-moving crowd.

The key for me is about what I can carry into the venue once the line waiting is over.

For me, that would be the HS which is lighter and folds into a bag. At a place where I'm getting a product and walking out -- the QES will do. But if I'm going to a Broadway show where space is limited, the HS is much more suited.

This is perfect, it is well made, high quality fabric and very sturdy, I believe this will last me a very long time.  I just received it so, I've only tried it out in the house on wood flooring and carpet, I felt very comfortable sitting in it, no issues with pinching, instability or tipping of any kind and it can hold someone up to 250 lbs.  I also like the addition of the beverage holder and how quickly the chair folds up when you pull the shoulder strap.  If I have to carry the chair while walking my bike, the shoulder strap not only makes this possible, but makes this very easy and quick.

B00140Y4JS,4.0,"Sturdy, I first saw these at a big box store and sat in it.  The back support m,akes a huge difference.  The triangular ones that have no back support -- and I think this same company makes that one, too -- is nowhere near as comfortable.  So, if you are debating with or without the back support, pay more for the support.

Construction is good, does fold up very well, and is quite comfortable.  I'm only 169 lbs, 5' 9"" though, so if you're a big person, you might want to find one at a store and try it first. It is much quicker and smaller than the ""bag chairs"", and I could use this for extended time, such as at a ballgame.  It's likely heavier, though, than you'd want to bring on a hiking  or backpacking trip (estimate 3 lbs) and if you are car camping, you'd likely want a real, solid chair (like a director's style chair).

Two small notes:  this does not have a bag to put it in.  A bag might have been tidy, but it does go into a small size without it, but it sort of opens up when you lift it, so a bag would have been nice.  And second, keep in mind that it's legs are close together, and if you use it on a soft surface (damp dirt, etc.), it'll push in far to the ground because your weight is over it.  It does not have a wide base of support from legs that extend beyond the chair itself; the legs are only directly under the chair.  I have no issue toppling over in it, but the legs are not splayed like a bag chair, so you could never, for instance, use this on the beach unless you bring it to hard, wet sand maybe.

B0015NA2L8,4.0,"I have been a lifetime student of numerous martial arts (Judo, Jujitsu, Karate-Do, Kenjutsu, Kendo, Wakizashi-Jutsu, Tanto jutsu etc.) both as a student and instructor.  I have purchased numerous types of different Bokken (Practice Bokken Samurai Long Sword-Katana) for my Samurai Aerobics classes. They have been made from various types of wood as well as some hard plastic models.  This model (40 foam rubber practice Bokken) I found to be a very good practice Bokken for the price.

Even though this is a wooden Bokken covered by rubber, it really is not designed to practice full contact training.  This is where some of the previous reviewers may have been mistaken, thinking the foam rubber covering would make it a good contact training weapon.  I personally thought this Bokken was fairly durable and rugged in my sword classes.  We would practice 100s of cuts and slashes as well as kata using this rubber covered Bokken.  We even had some light contact but not full power strikes (We would use a Kendo sword for full contact) with this model. One other thing, the rubber makes the grip very solid when practicing the cuts, slashes and combination techniques.

In conclusion, if you are seeking a fairly balanced foam rubber Bokken to practice your cuts, thrusts and kata with, you may want to check out this model.

There are some weird /exotic  seat designs out there, some much more expensive. But hands down, this Serfas RX Cruiser Saddle was the best for comfort, reliability and performance, no question.

Serfas makes a smaller seat that is best for youth or smaller people, the Hybrid RX saddle. The Hybrid RX has everything scaled down,...e.g. narrower, less padding, slightly shorter snout, made for a smaller person.

The product pictures are misleading. In the Amazon pictures, the Hybrid RX actually looked to be LARGER than the RX Cruiser pic though it is actually smaller. But I had to actually sit them side by side to understand the differeces. So even though the Amazon picture implies the Hybrid is larger,...it is in fact, smaller. The slightly larger, better built RX Cruiser is the best seat and little more expensive, too.

If you need max support, max comfort, max protection, comfortable fabric,... then the RX Cruiser is the one. I love it. Makes riding a joy and easier to ride miles longer. Wide but not too wide, longer but not too long. Just well proportioned. Supports each cheek bone without compromise or over kill. Like independent suspension.  On the smaller Hybrid model, my cheek bones did not sit in the sweat spot on the seat & was not comfortable. I've had this seat for several months now and cannot find any drawbacks.

B001MJYG8U,3.0,"I purchased this saddle to put on my 3 Spd Beach Cruiser. I have had a springer seat on it for about three years, but after getting more and more into cycling and exploring other types of riding, I found the spring seat to feel a little lackluster.

I have heard really great things about the Serfas Rx so I thought I'd give it a go.

Installation was easy, after all its a saddle. There is ample adjustment available on the rails an can be made easily and stay securely in place once made.
The feel of this saddle is nice, but I'm not sure it is what I was really looking for in a Cruiser saddle. Because of the upright riding position on a cruiser there i more body weight right over the spine and tailbone, which seems to really get transferred right to the stiffest part of this saddle, at least in my case. I didn't think that my spring saddle was really doing a lot of shock absorbing, but I was wrong. The difference is vastly huge when on the Serfas Rx.

Now, I will tell you that I am 230lbs, so that has a great deal to due with the comfort issues I am experiencing, plus I haven't spent very much time with this saddle. I have ridden about 8 times for about 4 miles each time (work commute) on this saddle, and I started to become more at home with it, so I will give it some more time before I make a final decision.

The price is very good and the quality of construction of this saddle appear to be by good as well. I can't see it having any issues performance wise, it may just not be the right saddle for my bike and bum.
As I said I'll spend some more time with it and see what happens.

I do think I will try the Serfas Rx men's saddle for my hybrid commuter and see how it feels on that bike as I have about 1200 mi on the stock saddle (Scwhinn) and its starting to show.

Cons: Pressure guage is way off mark and there is no way you are going to get 120psi+ unless you weigh 500# and can push a bsolutely straight down. The tire chuck is a bit hard to work so that you can keep all the air in the tire you just pumped up - so over pressurize and then check with a pencil type guage after you get the chuck off.

The pump, when asymetrically loaded, allows air to escape past the internal mechanism so air does not go into tire but to free air.  That said, I have pumped a tire to 65# with no issues if I concentrate on keeping a straight down load on the handle.  This requires usin both hands and pushing with equal pressure and this can be a bit tricky.  Once you learn the pump things should be fine but be aware that this can and does happen.

I would buy again because of the price but do not over pressurize because of the innaccurate guage.  The guage needs a bit of work by the mfg.  Have use for 6 months or more several times a week.  If you want to spend a $100 for a really good pump do that but otherwise this one is ok.",Good value,True,8
B001NXC7TA,5.0,"My husband and I are avid fishing people.  We catch anything from a small panfish such as Perch and Crappie, to huge monsters like Walleyes and Salmon.  The Rapala Rechargeable Electric Fillet Knife has made life so much easier when it comes to filleting fish.  No need to be always sharpening the blade like you have to with a regular fillet knife, and no cords to get in the way.  Everything stores in a neat storage case which makes it easy to take along on trips.  Holds the charge for a long time - we have yet to run into a problem with the charge dying in between uses. Having two different blade sizes is also a plus.

B001NXC7TA,4.0,"This is nice to have the liberty to not deal with chords hanging or worrying about power nearby... I prefer it over the plug in.. however the plugin will have a higher repetition of movements than the battery version, but not enough to warrant a buying decision.

NON-Rechargeable plugin - The only negative is that the plugin gets quite hot... as after about 20 fish, I have to start blowing in the vent holes to cool the motor... part of the vent fins are right where your hand goes and so plugs the holes.. but so far the knife still works great.

Rechargeable version - Works great!... my only negative is that if you get the battery wet ""like a wave splash on it"", it may not work the next day... at least mine worked perfect until that happened and I tried to use it again later.. now that particular battery flashes wildly from red to green on the charger when attempting a charge.. the knife still works great with the other battery.

You do have to learn how to press the button ""down"" and then pull the switch back to activate the blades... an extra safety measure that can be annoying.. the plugin doesn't have that issue.

Each battery will clean about 30 fish before dieing. A very nice tool to have away from power or when you hate fighting with chords.

Original: I've only had this a few hours but couldn't wait to post that this *is* a replacement for a general corded electric knife. All I have to compare it to is our old crusty (but trusty) kitchen gourmet model but I just compared them side by side on last night's leftover chicken breast. The cuts are the same, even though I haven't conditioned or re-charged the battery I used out of the box. I did not preceive a significant difference in power but there may be. Also, the long-blade (only 7.5"" unfortunately) is exactly the same size as our old corded model. In fact, they look identical except for the end shape (dull vs. pointed). The pointed end is more convenient around and along bones anyway, so there's no advantage to the old dull end shape. Although you can get a descent corded knife for about 1/4-1/3 the price, I'm very tired of the inconvenience and how dirty (greasy) that old cord gets. I bought this for myself for father's day! I might even take up fishing. I wish it had a 10-inch blade, but not enough to ding the rating 1 point (maybe 1/2 point).","Yes this is a ""general"" electric knife too...",True,

B001OXUZMU,3.0,"The adjustment mechanism on this board is pretty ingenious.  You can easily spin it and lock it down between 3 different levels.  It also seems pretty durable and doesn't appear as though it'll break due to heavy use.  The board on top is solid and sturdy, and there is a non-stick adhesive on the top that is only partially effective.  The adhesive on top is clear and has a textured surface to it to prevent you from sliding off of it when using it, but I still find the adhesive to not provide enough traction.  If you use the board with shoes it'll work fine, but if you use it barefoot and your feet are dry, or you're wearing socks, it's not effective.  They have some other producs where they use the black adhesive which will give your feet a much stronger grip, and I'm at a loss for words as to why they don't use that on this product.  If it were easy to replace the adhesive I'd give this product 4 stars, but it's going to be a PITA to get that clear stuff off of there and put on stronger grip stuff.  Other than that, it's an effective product.

Oh! Know that if you if you're going to use this board on a hard floor, like concrete or tile, it gets LOUD and annoying listening to the board always hitting the floor.  You might want to consider attaching something around the bottom board, perhaps an adhesive felt or something to mute the sound a little.  I use the board on a rubber gym floor and that keeps it relatively quiet, but on a tile floor, you can hear me using the board from outside the house!

B001UNX4Q8,3.0,"I know these are packed by the same people who make real MRE's, atleast that's what posted all over the internet, BUT...they are several problems with these.

1. No heaters : No where does it say that. No biggee, you can get a hexamine stove for cheap but you'll have to carry extra water and a vessel to boil the food in. Not a huge hit but it was the first indication that all was not what it should be.

2. Menu selection : This is a good or bad thing. I (luckily) got 3 meatloafs, 2 Beef Enchilada, 2 Chicken, broiled, 2 chick w/tomato sauce, and 3 Beef Stew. God Forbid I had got 3 Veggie Burgers or (gasp) 3 Ham/cheese Omelets (yuck). Not only that but the desert (chocolate cookies) and the Cracker w/ Apple Jelly was in EVERY packet...every single one had them. I know these are supposed to be camping or emergency rats...but some variation would have been nice. No bread (poppy sead or regular) and no cake loaf (lemon)...no fruit, no nuts...no nothing. OH..and they ALL had beverage, orange flavor..that's it...no coffee and no fake milkshake mix. These are definetly COST CUTTER MRE's!

3. The supposed 'real' accesories pack : One thing the internet lauded about these Superpaks was the access pack is the same as the military MRE's...NOT any more. I got a 3 tan kleenex's as my 'napkin'...a salt pack, a pepper pack, a wipe, a spoon (close but not exact).

4. Price : $74 delivered is ok. You can get REAL MRE's (I know they're illegal to sell but they are everywhere) for $85-$95 shipped. OR..You can go to any nice sized gun show and pick up cases for $70. So these were OK...but still NOT a deal..

3 stars...just ""ok"" is all I can say.

On the upside they were freshly made...so I can get some life out of them...which considering they are all orange drink, apple jelly, chocolate chip cookies...It will probably keep me from eating them.

B0023TG6PO,4.0,"It's a bucket. It holds things. A bit pricey for what it is, but I basically bought it to be used with the coaches bucket organizer bag.",Not bad,True,
B0023TG6PO,5.0,"Well, uh... it's a bucket... with a padded seat lid.  It does what it should-  holds stuff and acts as a seat when you need it.  I have mine wrapped with the Easton coaches organizer and use it religiously for baseball games.  Lid fits tightly, but I can get it off without breaking my fingers (or exhausting my patience).  This is not a ""thin, cheap"" bucket.  it is heavy/durable enough to take some abuse-  no distortion, no cracks in the bottom, handle is sturdy and mine is still perfectly secured after carrying everything short of Sakrete in it.  I have also used the padded lid/bucket combo as a step ladder on more occasions than I should.  Even with weight (190lbs) channeled through one foot right in the center of the lid, it hasn't cracked and doesn't feel flimsy at all.  It's also pretty much water proof.  I've had to endure a couple of LONG rain delays.  I took the organizer/wrap off of the outside, shoved it and a handful of mitts and other baseball sundries inside, snapped on the lid and voila--- no soggy stuff to contend with.  There are lots of options in the bucket/padded lid combo market.  Can't speak to the quality of any others, but this one works great.

B0023TG6PO,5.0,"Do you want to call pitches from between the on deck circle and the dugout? Do you want to throw sunflower seeds on the ground from 2 feet high when your shortstop forgets who is covering second on the steal? Do you need something to sit on while keeping the book and pretending you are helping? Do you want to sit down because you haven't exercised in forever? Have I got the bucket for you.

It also holds things. Usually baseballs, but that isn't the end of what it can hold. It can hold your drink, your wallet, your lineup cards, your scoresheets, your pencils, your phone, or your seeds. I've even put my mitt in it after warming up the right fielder between innings.

In addition to the bucket itself it has a nice handle that allows you to move it quickly and easily. More than once I've had to get out of the way when a live ball was heading right at me; the handle made this simple to do.

But wait, there's more. The lid is padded so it is soft on my big fat butt while I'm screaming at children to play better than me when I was a kid. It's a foam that seems to be water resistant, so you don't have to worry about getting your behind wet while trying to get that last fall game in while it is raining and slowly turning to snow.

There isn't a better bucket out there for living vicariously through your child while sitting down. I can't think of a single better way to sit at a ball game than just outside the dugout in foul territory on this bucket.

If you are looking for a substitute for another body to get the ball back to you, this is your rebounder.

B002CENQ94,5.0,"Ok, first off i love the design of the knife; it has a few interesting features that are supposed to aid in the claims that tops knives makes that make this knife what its designed to do. they say its supposed to punch through and cut aircraft aluminium, be able to be used as a breaching tool & also punch through wood doors and with a twist of the wrist separate that wood. i was skeptical. of those claims. i pretty much bought this knife as a survival knife for the woods, and if needed a close quarter combat knife; the original purpose of this knife was for those serving in the stryker groups in the military. After one incident id say this knife lives up to tops knives claim. one afternoon i saw a rather large alligator snapping turtle near my pond, seeing its a fish eater and the pond is stocked; i had to shoot it. afterwards it was still moving, so i decided to finish it off and put it out of its misery. i pulled out my Stryker, flipped it over and with one plunge the knife went through the shell; with a twist of the wrist it split the shell wide open. i only have two gripes about the knife in general. first, the blade doesn't keep a sharp edge; gonna have to work on that. second is the sheath. the belt loop is way to wide for a standard belt and the plastic insert is a bit wide from side to side, the knife will move around a bit and make noise as you walk no matter how tight you secure the velcro straps. it comes with a paracord leg tie down, if you feel like dealing with knots. or you can get a bed roll strap and slip it through the webbing on the back of the knife. that's what i did, it helps with the noise; but you end up having to adjust it every bow and then. i just let it hang freely and deal with the noise. this is a great all around knife, just check sharpness before going out.",love this knife!!!,True,3
B002NXRW62,5.0,"Bought this for an upcoming trip to a hot & humid destination. After some skepticism about bad reviews for some snap cooling towels, I came across Frogg Toggs and they all had glowing reviews, even if just a few. I decided to try them. They were out of stock on Amazon so that told me they must work! I went to Golfsmith's site directly and liked how I could see that it was available to ship (blue is more popular i guess.) Got 2 Khaki in stock. It comes in the tube w/ lid, nice if you want to store it in that while wet. The towel comes a bit stuck together but after reading directions you rinse in warm water and it loosens. Ours did not smell like i've read in another review. It has a textured side and a smooth side. The textured to cool, the smooth to absorb moisture. After wringing out excess water it starts to cool in a minute! Amazing and strange at the same time. It feels like a cold towel and you know it's wet but it doesn't get your clothes wet! You can wrap around neck or shoulder, or lay it on your lap or against your face, it's remarkably cool. After 2 hours I noted it was still cool. It says up to 4 hours depending on conditions, but you just keep wet and it keeps cool. You can wash it and it should last for years.

I read in some other online reviews that after soaking for a while they loosen up.  It wasn't mentioned however that you had to do this for every single use.  At the festival, we basically had to leave these in the cooler water overnight in order for them to not dry up and become stiff.  Perhaps this is the same with all evaporative towels but these are the first ive used.

My first use was while out on a kayak paddle on a slow moving river in direct sunlight and the actual temperature was just under 100f. I didn't follow the directions of wash it first since I came straight from the store to the water and had just tossed it in the kayak so it wouldn't  possibly get stolen out of my truck while I was away. Anyway I was about 2 miles from my truck when I started feeling overheated and stopped sweating. Not good, especially when paddling upstream back to the dock. I dropped anchor, took it out of the package and dunked it in the water and got it totally soaked then put it on my head and neck. In just a few minutes I was sweating again and felt like much better. About a mile further up it started to geta little breezy and I actually got chilly and goose bumps so I took off my head and just left it around my neck. I've washed it several times since and it dries like cardboard but I can still roll it up and put it in its carry pouch (the container it came in doubles as a carry pouch) but not being a big fan of smelling like laundry detergent I've started using unscented to stop the detergent smell when it gets wet that wouldn't come out before.
I've also used it on several occasions at work when it gets ridiculous humid, extremely hot or not , because unlike my clothes the water stays chillier than the surrounding temps.
The other dayis loaded a whole truck of cabinets by hand and felt wiped so I pulled the towel out of my truck, wet it and within half an hour I felt truly refreshed, though still a bit tired. I saw another co-worker who looked like he was about to fall over from working in the sun all day at the end of the day, his only defense against the heat/sun was soaking his hat so I ordered this one when I got home since my local fishing store didn't have any yet, it was delivered on a Sunday and I gave it to him on Monday. We had a cold front come through on Saturday so he hasn't tried it yet but if it turns out like the one I use, the ones I gave to my mother in law, daughter and a buddy, he'll really appreciate it when it turns hot and humid again.
I've tried many others that were less expensive or more expensive and they're more like wearing a dry weave shirt in that they're good when wet but dry out in no time unless you wear them your sweat moisturizes them, which for me is a losing proposition and I don't have time to frequently dip them in water. Yes they weigh less, look more fashionable and have the must have logo in just the right location but I'm not getting paid to advertise for the latest brand craze at the expense of my health and well-being.
When done with it for the day I lay it out flat and it's dry the next day and doesn't get that bacteria feces or soured laundry smell when wet again. I wash it every other week along with my safety vest and work gloves and line dry it outside (or inside of it's a rainy weekend).
I'll be buying a second one for myself at some point for grass cutting and kayaking so I don't have to remember to bring it home from work on non wash days as in Virginia the storms of summer don't care about my laundry schedule so I do the things I did in the sun as the weather permits.

B002NXRW62,5.0,"I bought another one of these for our trip to Disney as my husband had one. We were in Epcot the week of April 10th, 2017, when my husband who was wearing his, happened upon a handicapped man who had fallen onto the ground from his motorized wheelchair. He was a quadriplegic and on a ventilator. My husband is a paramedic firefighter and was assisting this man. He was laying on the extremely hot pavement and I knew what I had to do. I took my brand new cloth out of the cold ziploc it was in, and gave it to the man. My husband put it on his neck and told him to take it with our compliments. His wife was extremely grateful. I know this is a great cloth, my husband attested to that fact, but for me, it had a higher purpose.

B002NXRW62,1.0,"If you live an active lifestyle, or just want to enjoy the hotter spring and summer months, a cooling towel can be a heaven-sent.

My wife bought me two of them about three years ago, when practically no one was using them or had heard of them. I ended up pulling one out while I was volunteering to collect canned foods for a local pantry on a super hot and humid day in August. It was awesome. But, then I lost them. Like when your socks disappear. So, I ordered a Frogg Togg to replace the ones I couldn't find.

The principle is simple, you wet them, and a few moments later, they are still wet AND cool, offering lots of relief on a hot day.

The Frogg Togg comes mildly damp, inside of a very sturdy triangular tube. You're instructed to add warm water, which will begin to evaporate in minutes and you're ready to use. But what the directions don't tell you is this - the Frogg Togg is more a rubbery material. So, while it is soft and supposedly hypoallergenic - it doesn't irritate sensitive skin, it dries out very quickly and if you dampen and seal it in the tube, it will begin to smell like mildew in hours.

I've used mine a total of 2 times. And only once while working out. The other time, I simply threw it around my neck while standing out in the sun. And it smells terrible. And when it dries out, it is hard as a rock and flat as a piece of paper, which makes getting it back into the tube impossible.  It also doesn't stay damp for very long. While standard fabric style cooling towels stay mildly damp for hours, the Frogg Togg will dry out in 15 minutes, if you don't continue to wet it. Which you obviously can't do if you're jogging, or playing a sport. And remember, storing in the tube to keep it wet WILL make it smell. And also that sturdy tube? Well, it's so sturdy that you will bruise or cut yourself trying to get this squishy rubbery towel back into it while its damp.

Here's the biggest problem - it doesn't cool you down very much at all. Unless, you're at the gym, and the air conditioning hits it. Then it will amplify that coolest to great heights. But, most people that use a cooling towel will be outside. So......yeah, its not very good at what it should be doing. Fabric style cooling towels on the other hand, only need water, warm or cold, and they will get cool and stay damp AND cool for hours. And they won't irritate sensitive skin.

I'm putting in a return request today. I'll be going to back to the EnduraCool brand. Frogg Togg is not up to par.","Doesn't cool, Doesn't Stay Wet, Doesn't Stack Up To Competition",True,

Sometimes I'll even take an extra one and drape it on my arms to cool off as well. I really should buy these and sell them at the swim meet. I'd make a ton of money because everyone needs them.
  They are super easy to use just keep them damp. They do work better for our dry heat, not sure how well it would work if it were really humid. Had some friends come for denmark and they took some home because they liked them so much.i will never go through an arizona summer without these towels.
I understand that the 1-5 star rating is to help both buyers and sellers. Here is a breakdown of how my 1-5 ratings are determined:
 5-star rating that means that I truly love that product and it has features that put it above and beyond what would normally be expected, and it is something that wowed me and I am truly glad I purchased it and would purchase it again. Also I recommend it to everyone and anyone!

4-star ratings are items that do exactly as would be expected of the item, is of very good quality, but does not stand out significantly in any way unless I specifically state why it stands out. But all in all, this item is a solid item and is still highly recommended. It just didn't have the wow factor that my 5 star ratings would have had.
3-star ratings are given on items because my feeling about the product is neutral. I do not consider it a negative, but it just did not wow me, or there is nothing of great significance.
1 or 2-star ratings are rarely given unless the item is completely worthless and not worth the money, and I am only giving that rating as a warning to others. Some items have received lower ratings because of the way they were made or put together, and it is getting that review because of the quality of the item, which is specifically described in my review. It has to be pretty bad to get these ratings from me!",they really work!!,True,
B002NXRW62,3.0,"Works decently to cool off your neck, but it just makes me want to use it for my face as a towel. Cleaning and storing it has given me some problems however.
After just 1 use, I cleaned it with cold running water and a little bit of dish soap and put it into a ziplock bag with a little bit of water. The next time I pulled it out there was small black dots all over it. I would assume this is mold...which sucks.
I would recommend this towel if you have a specific event thats going to be super hot (ie: vacation to the beach exc) but not for daily use as the risk of mold is high (going by other people's reviews too). I would recommend storing it DRY like others are saying, as mine was quick to mold.","Decent towel, watch out for mold spots if stored wet!!!",True,3
B002NXRW62,4.0,"Overall, I will start by saying this is a good product. I live in Phoenix, AZ. We started this summer with record high temperatures ranging from 115-118 degrees Fahrenheit. So.. I knew that with an upcoming camping trip and a horseback riding adventure, I was going to need some 'stay cool' help. Everything the prior reviews have indicated was 100% correct. These things smell terrible straight out of packaging. You are instructed to wash them first which I did. These do effectively cool. It is slightly surprising how much cooling actually takes place, but it was a life saver.. or so I thought. The specs said up to 4 hours cooling time I believe. I can only imagine that this is tested indoors where a/c is running. with a 2 hour horseback ride these things were bone dry within an hour. I used my personal water bottle in 115 degree heat so that my daughter would still have a cooling pad and still have drinking water for herself. It is what parents do, so I am not upset about that. I feel like a better representation of how these would work outdoors would be more realistic. Obviously people who live in hot places want these items. 4 hours and 1 hour are very different when contemplating outdoor activities. They are effective as long as you have a continued source of water, these would be very helpful. If you do not, you will find yourself like we were high and dry. When these dry they are stiff like leather and not easily put away. Overall, a good value, but just remember what is needed to make these functional for whatever function you are attending.","Great Product, but misleading on usage time",True,13
B002NXRW62,4.0,"This does feel surprisingly cool.  I tried it at home at my desk on a warm day, and it was uncomfortable after a while.  Felt a bit like having wet clothes and coming into an air conditioned room.  Outside, it feels more appropriate.  It was a little thicker than I expected so not as floppy as a cotton towel would be.  I bought a much thinner one at a big box retailer, and found out that the thinness is easier to use, but due to how little water is in there, that one gets warm fast.  So this thicker type is much better for actual cooling since it holds more water and I think it transfers heat slowly, which makes it cooler.  Basically in the thin one, the water warms up from my body warmth and though it is cooler than not having it, it does not feel really cold.

It had an unusual smell right out of the container.  I ran it through the washer and that basically got rid of it.  The smell wasn't bad, but I suppose some people would have a problem with it.  The only thing I can compare it to is some Japanese mushrooms are sold dried and you soak them in water for a while then use them for cooking. It had a similar smell to some of those.","Feels much cooler, but a it is thicker than I thought",True,2

B002NXRW62,5.0,"Five 14-hour days in 96 F heat at Disney more than proved to us that these make a significant difference in keeping you cooler. My wife did not care for the feeling of it and initially neither did my daughters but soon the girls were insisting on one of their own. It's not icky-sticky but does have a wet, somewhat rubbery feel. Wasn't uncomfortable to me at all.
I kept mine pretty wet just using tap cool water so my shirt became a bit damp only where the cooling towel was at times but never too wet or nearly saturated. Used with less water it left no wetness or dampness at all on my shirts. Even on white t-shirts it left no stain or trace of having been on my neck all day. No skin irritation at all.
After an hour of standing in lines in direct noon sunlight (heat index over a hundred) it was still providing a very nice cooling effect. Eventually it will lose the coolness but if you take it into air conditioning even for a few minutes, the towel really gets cooled again and retains it. It's like recharging a battery. Rotating the towel surface touching your skin every so often also keeps it cooling longer.
We also tried the Ergodyne 6602 - it works but doesn't get as cool or retain the chill like these Frogg Toggs do.
Disney is crazy not to be selling these instead of ridiculously weak battery fans on cheesy squirt bottles. I lost count of the people who stopped us and asked where to get these. Also saw dozens of others with cooling towels during our week.
I consider this a must-have now if I'm going to be out in the summer heat for several hours.

It works well on hot days and keeps you fairly cool and from being dehydrated.  The quality is pretty good, and it is comparable to other cooling towels I've used.  The size though is very nice which kinda makes it stand out for me.  Because it is large, I think it holds more water within itself and keeps you cool a lot longer.  if it starts to now be as cool, snap the towel and it activates it and works again.

There are a lot of assorted colors available.  I recommend the Frogg Toggs snap towel because of the size of the towel and how much longer it seems to keep you cool.

However, there is another use for the textured side - as a shower mat! I have used this many times in places where the shower stall is slick or the area outside the shower stall or changing area is dangerously slick. The textured side provides a very nice grip against your feet in either case and the smooth side stayed put on damp (not flooded) smooth floors.

B002NXRW62,5.0,"Went to Taiwan in late June of 2015.  They hit record highs (over 100 F) while I was there, and boy were these things a life saver.  My family kept stealing mine from me in the beginning of the trip before they believed it would work.  You bet they started soaking theirs each morning & bringing it with them!
The key is to oversoak them (so much so that they're dripping) then GENTLY wring them out (trial and error here).  You're aiming to get these to -almost- dripping.
I found that if you ride that dripping edge these can last 5-6 hours without needing new water (probably less in more arid climates).  The beautiful thing about them is that you can flip it or wring it out onto itself to cool off a warm side really quickly.  Also, if you fold them carefully, you can shove these into the plastic containers they come with then cap them.  Seals in the water pretty good & keeps them moist for later!

I haven't had any problems with mold or odors or anything like that (and in 100+ F temps you sweat a TON) and used them for a week straight.  I just rinsed & wrung them out 2-3 times each night in fresh water.  In the mornings they'd still be damp, but smelled clean.  Drying them is a little trickier since they dry pretty rigid after use (not as soft as when you first get them new).  So if you want to store them in a certain way/container you need to half dry them out then fold them how you want & only then let them dry out completely.",Over 100F? No problem!,True,

So, I hang it and then I can't roll it back up because it is as stiff as a board at that point until it is put back in water. This makes it difficult to store.

B002NXRW62,3.0,These towels are alright to have when it is real hot out. They stay cool for a pretty good amount of time even when it is very hot.

Also they suggest you store it wet. Be warned it will mold, It looks and feel like the same material used in a synthetic chamois.

B002NXRW62,4.0,"My husband uses these all the time in the summer and just raves about them. He loves how they feel around his neck and he thinks they do a really good job at keeping him cool while golfing and/or doing yard/garage work on a hot sunny day. They feel cool, but not wet which is really nice. They also seem to retain the moisture for a long time before needing to rinse again. The moisture doesn't really transfer to your clothing either so it's not like you have a wet rag draped around your neck that soaks your shirt where it touches. This is a big plus.

I knocked one star because when they do start to dry, they get very stiff--think of a wet rag that was frozen while draped over something. It becomes uncomfortable very fast at that point until you can get it wet again. My husband also just leaves these on his pile of dirty clothes and they dry stiff in whatever shape they were on the floor, which makes them hard to put away.

With winds blowing up from Africa and our rental homes not having AC, these towels proved invaluable for actually allowing us to sleep despite the sweltering temps.  They would remain cool and damp until around 3am, so I would just get up and re-wet them.  We would not have been able to sleep without these at our disposal.  The only thing I think people should note is that they DO feel a bit damp and will leave the surface they're used on damp as well.

This is a good product because it can retain water easily, and if the towel soaked too much water, just wring it out a little and can put it around your neck without it dripping everywhere.
I use this product at work. Unfortunately, due to high temperatures, and stuffy, humid air, it gets very hot at my place of work. Because of how hot it is I have to rewet my towel frequently because it can evaporate quickly.
Only problem I had was, that I thought the material of the towel is too thick and I couldn't really tie this towel around my head like a head band.

B002NXRW62,4.0,"This towel gets remarkably cool when wet. It does have to be repositioned often as it absorbs the heat of the skin it is touching. I haven't tested it for an extended period of time in extremely hot and *humid* conditions yet. It works pretty well in dry conditions. The material is quite soft. One definite drawback is that it cannot be stored as directed without getting mold and mildew.  Unless you use this pretty much on a daily basis, you have to let it hang somewhere and dry out to keep it from molding and smelling horrible. However, it does seem to return to its original properties once you get it wet again. Also, the Varsity Blue is a beautiful color, but it does bleed/fade significantly when you wash it.  I can only assume this will eventually slow down or stop after a few more washes. On the other hand, the lime green one did not bleed/fade at all.","Remarkably cool, but don't store it wet for very long.",True,

Once it starts to warm up, just hit it with the garden hose, rinse and repeat. Good for 20 minutes or so each time.

The next week, I started to notice that black spots started to form deep in the fabric of the product.  So...I continued to use it.

The following week, the spots were spreading, were darker in shade and getting larger and were more numerous.  So, I got about two weeks out of it before it started to mold like crazy.  To contrast this, I had a TYR shammy for about two years and never once saw any mold...I only tried this product out because that shammy was stolen along with my car (before it was found set on fire by an interstate! wtf!)

B002NXRW62,3.0,"I purchased this product for use while baby-wearing as it keeps the parent and the child cool. This is a very genius solution to this problem that many moms are just now discovering. The towel arrived in its container moist (definite disgusting factor) but I read that this was to keep it pliable and was normal. Washed like a dream and hung to dry. Which then turned my Chill Pad into a rock-hard piece of chill pad. The instructions say to store moist in the original container (which has some holes in the lid for ventilation) but many reviews stated they did just that and ended up with moldy chill pads. No thanks! After seeing how stiff this dried, I re-wet it, then dried it in a more pleasing shape (folded in half and then in half again) so it was easier to stack in the cabinet. I store mine completely dry on a shelf in the garage. Doesn't take long to re-wet and use. Overall, not a bad product, if you don't follow the manufacturers instructions for storage.

feels great when wet but you can't roll it back up wet so it can be stored away, it will never dry, i tried.
you have to let it dry out flat or lay it bent over something, then it gets stiff as a board and try to bend it after that, good luck, you can't, it took up so so much room in my workout bag, i couldn't handle it, i had to throw it away. lesson learned, stick with cotton type towels.",stiff and regret it,True,

As with any device that relies on evaporation to cool, this works best on low humidity days (don't have many of those in Alabama).  Even on relatively humid days it works well enough to use.  I am surprised at how much water the ""fabric"" is able to absorb and hold... This isn't your typical towel.  Looks like I'll have to by another for my son.","Bought to give away, but I'm keeping it for myself",True,
B002NXRW62,5.0,"I used this for 5 days during the music festival Bonnaroo. In mid June, temperatures in Tennessee can reach up to 90 degrees F and in an open field with minimal shade, this chilly pad was a LIFE SAVER. The relief and coolness I felt by putting in around my neck, on my legs, or even on top of my head was invaluable. Idk how I would have survived without it. Since the festival, I've taken it to sporting events where the stands are brutal with heat and sun rays. It can also be used as a cool place to sit down on hot surfaces. The pad gets very stiff when it dries out, but not to worry! One dip in water and it is as flexible and comfortable as ever. It's amazing how long this pad stays wet and cold. I soaked it at 10am and it stayed moist and cooled me down until around 6pm the same day. It's nice to re-wet it for maximum coolness, but the pad really does stay moist all day!

B002NXRW62,1.0,Total waste of money. Just a rubber(or whatever) towel. Does not stay cool and dries almost as fast as just using a cloth towel. This thing provides no benefit at all vs a wet towel.

B002NXRW62,4.0,First off this is not like putting an ice pack on yourself. I was not expecting super cold results for this product. I live in SW Florida where summers are brutal with high humidity. But it does certainly help keep you cooler than you would be without one. I ordered the Varsity Blue and the Khaki. I think this will really help when riding my motorcycle this summer. Generally it cools to about 15-20 degrees than the ambient air temperature. Might not seem like much but a blessing for where I live. I ordered the headband as well.

B002NXRW62,5.0,"This showed up just before my walk yesterday in the Florida heat with my dog and my 11 months old who I wear in the ergo baby carrier. Just a few days ago it finally got too hot for us to be able to continue going on walks. It's vital for my health, my dog's health, my dog's sanity, and my sanity. For baby carrying, this is about the best solution imaginable. I will modify how I use it next time to maximize the evaporation, because when it's stuck between you and baby, not a whole lot of evaporation happens. I'm thinking of slowly feeding it through from one end to the other and back again.

While I was walking the dog, my husband was out and got sunburned. I put the chilly pad on his burned shoulders and it is 1000x times better than the cooling effects of aloe vera because it lasts seemingly forever.

Maybe I don't know my colors, but when I think Varsity blue I think of the dark blue used for sports jersey's?  Not a big deal.  I will still use it, just wish it was the color I thought I was getting.

B002NXRW62,4.0,"The Frogg Toggs Chilly Pad did a pretty good job keeping my neck cool during a 15-mile bike ride, but I found it a bit of a challenge to keep it in place.  The ever present breeze that comes with a bike ride made it difficult to keep it on my neck.  I even tried putting it under my bike helmet and wearing it like a French Foreign-Legion cap, but that allowed the loose ends to flutter in the wind and dry out faster.

I still give it four stars, because it does help cool you down as long as you keep it wet.  If you can carry an extra bottle of water to keep the pad wet, the Chilly Pad does what it was designed to do.",Cool,True,
B002NXRW62,2.0,"The Chilly Pads are slightly better than a cold wet towel.
I suppose if I was stranded in the Sahara desert...

B002NXRW62,5.0,OK - I'm sold on these Frogg Toggs! They are definiately worth the money - especially if you have an athlete in your home. These towels lasted an entire 14-hour baseball day in the middle of July in the Memphis heat - although I did re-wet them several times. What I love is you can even use warm water and the towel feels cool afterwards. So I pack water bottles outside of my cooler and am able to use them to refresh the towels. They are also ample size.

Read no further and buy this towel,True,
B002NXRW62,4.0,"The chilly pad comes in a plastic package inside of the case. Once you open it up all you need to do is run it under water and hand wash it with mild detergent and rinse the detergent out with water again. After that you are ready to go. The first time I used it, I squeezed the excess water but left an ample amount soaked in so it wouldn't dry up too quickly. You don't need to worry about it dripping. If anything, all it does is leave a small amount of moisture on the skin. This product stayed cool for about 4 hrs in 85 degree weather. I was starting to get too cold after using for several minutes. In higher temperatures you will probably need to wet it again more frequently. After you are done using it, wash it so that you may remove dirt or anything else that might have accumulated. Wring the water out but leave it slightly damp and put it in a large ziplock bag and put it back into its case. If you leave it out dry completely then it will turn stiff as a board. But you can always run it under water if that ever happens with no problems.",Great Cooling Pad,True,

B002NXRW62,2.0,"I had high hopes but little faith. It is one thing to use this in Arizona but something entirely different in Florida.

When they are dry, you can possibly take an eye out with the hard towel! The solution to this? As soon as they come out of the washer, we fold them up and just let them dry as is, and put them into our sport bags. When we get to the action, simply wet them down, and wait for the towel to ""hydrate"", and you're good to go.

B002NXRW62,4.0,"I wanted one of these from the moment I moved to the desert. I finally got one after 5 years. I work outdoors alot, and it gets HOT here as anyone could guess. I carry a fairly decent sized cooler with me and it is full of ice. I put the chilly pad in the bottom and ice on top. After an hour, the ice has started to melt and the chilly pad is ready to save the  day. Since the technology uses evaporation to really be fully effective, this is a great tool for a very dry arid area. However, when the monsoon season rolls in, and the humidity rolls in, it is far less useful. Like I said before, since the chilly pad uses evaporation technology, when its humid out, it just makes you feel a different variety of wet. I personally love the chilly pad. I just don't use it 2 months out of the year due to humidity. If you live in the southeast USA, or the midwest, I might try something else. I have lived both places and couldn't see it being very effective there.","Works great, especially in the desert of AZ.",True,

B002NXRW62,4.0,"I use this Frogg Togg Chilly Pad to help me keep cool while playing golf.  I wrap it around my neck in between shots, which appears to help my body cool down.  Towards the end of the round, I sometimes get a little headache.  However, I haven't had one when using this Chilly Pad so far (knock on wood).

My one concern is that the pad dries up pretty quickly (around 3.5 hours) even in cool weather (around 70 deg F). By 2-2.5 hours, the Chilly Pad isn't as effective (although still remains cool) unless you re-wet it again.  I played at one course that didn't have water dispensers, so I wasn't able to re-wet the Chilly Pad in the middle of the round.  This can become a problem during a typical weekend round that lasts 4-5 hours, and the tail end is when you likely will benefit the most from the Chilly Pad.  Aside from this, I think this product is great.

This product is very easy to use.  Note that when you receive the product, you have to wash it first.  Apart from that, you drench the pad,  squeeze the excess water off, and it's ready for use.",Great but needs to be drenched every 2 hours,True,

B002NXRW62,4.0,"I was skeptical that the Chilly Pad would actually deliver as promised, but believe it or not, it does. Using the product is easy: take it out, get it wet, and enjoy the coolness. A few comments:
1 - When you are done with it, try and lay it somewhere flat and let it COMPLETELY DRY. If you put it back in the plastic case, you will find it gets moldy. I believe these can be machine washed, which should fix the problem, but why even bother with this? Just wring it out, and lay it flat to dry. The pad will be completely dry (and hard) within 8-12 hours. Then you can literally fold it up for storage and later use.
2 - The chilly pad works well but it does have one nagging issue (why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5): when you wear it around your neck, the water in the pad tends to migrate down to the ends, leaving the spot right on your neck less wet (and therefore cool) than the ends. A workaround is to wrap the towel so the ends are up on your neck, too.
I've found that moving it around helps this problem. I've gotten nearly an hour of cooling with one of these in 90+ degree weather, without having to get it wet again.

All in all, a decent product for the price.",These things are legit!,True,4
B002NXRW62,5.0,"I'm a student pilot...in Texas. In case you did not know, Texas gets friggin' hot in the summer.

Long story short, I saw an ad for a similar towel from a different company. Using athletes, I guessed it should be a decent product. I researched it, and found the reviews to be so-so. Meanwhile, I found the Chilly Pad while researching. The majority of reviews were giving it a thumbs up. I'm a hard sell on reviews because, well, its mainly from housewives who watch Oprah, and dudes who want the exact thing they saw online, and bitch, piss and moan if just one thing is off then right a review about it.

We used washcloths but this is easier and the cooling lasts longer. Only drawback is don't dry it in the dryer because it stays in the shape it drays at. I recommend wringing it out well, folding it up in the shape you want to store it in, and let it air dry overnight. Easy, simple.

One more thing . . . I'd like the size to be wider, more like a 24x24. It is more useful and covers areas better if you want to cool someone that if hyper thermal or having a heat stroke.

I had tried the neck wraps that you soak in water, but found they were only cool until your body warmed it up, five minutes, tops. Like having a hot towel around your neck. I happened to see the Chilly Pad while searching for anything that would work for me in the summer, read all the reviews and uses, care, etc.. I thought I had to try it. It wasn't real hot yet, so the price was about $12+, shipping included. That price went up after summer kicked in, so a very seasonally priced item. I'd pay $30+ to have this!!! Maybe more, because of how it works so well to keep me from having heat headaches and dripping sweat! It keeps my neck and chest (it's 33"" long)cooler, so that my head doesn't explode from heat at work. Wringing out water keeps it damp enough, but no wet tee shirt. What is different is that you don't need cold water, or you don't have to fridgerate it it any way! The air blowing on the 'cooling side' of the cloth cools it! The sweat-absorbing side helped keep the dripping sweat to a bearable minimum on the worst humid day! I've used both sides in their capacity and this really works! It's washable in the wash machine. When it starts to dry, I just poor some water from my drinking cup, or water fountain to just rehydrate it and that is easy!!! I have even removed it to my abdomen area and got heat relief there.

Thankfully, I made it home before the basket became totally useless and not secure at all. I took a look at the velcro to see what happened and it was broken.

B003B7QFE4,1.0,"When we first got the basket we absolutely loved it, who wouldn't? Putting a small but functional removable basket on the front of your bike makes picnic trips so much easier. We only put roughly 5lbs in the basket because adding more weight causes the handles to be heavier, go figure, and makes it harder to turn. This is pretty standard of baskets and is not the fault of this particular basket.

For the basket to be put on properly it must go one way. The handles must be lifted up 90 degrees and then placed on the holder and when the handles go back down the basket is locked. Up until 3 weeks ago I loved this idea, now I hate it. Having a detachable basket is great, but this design needs more fail-safes than that. 3 weeks ago my mother and I went on a bike trip, she had this basket on her bike and 24 miles into our 58 mile ride, she hit the perfect bump that caused both handles to go up to the 90 degree position and release the basket. Since the basket sits over her front handlebars the basket fell infront of her bicycle and she then flipped over the handle bars. We were only going 7mph according to my bike computer. However due to her fall she shattered her left elbow and required sugary to fix her broken bones. For this basket another fail-safe must be implemented, another clasp or zip-tie or even a Velcro strap on one or both of the handles so this type of accident does not happen to anyone else.

If the event with my mother never happened I could have easily given it a 5/5 stars, but I feel compelled to give it 3/5 because there is a lack of fail-safes with the removeablity of the basket from dock.

So if you do buy this basket, or already own it and browsing reviews, I implore you to add a zip-tie or Velcro strap to at least one of the handles so this does not happen to you.","good, ish.",True,
B003B7QFE4,5.0,"I was tired of carrying all the tennis supplies on trips to the courts or lunches during picnic outings.  Plus she thought a basket would look cute on her bike.  I looked for one that could possibly hang behind her on the back of her seat; her seat has one of those old-style metal bars around the seat for pulling roller skaters.  This one looked like I might be able to put the hooks on the bar and the round grommet/clamp around the seat post.  However, when I tried it upon arrival, it wasn't the clamp but the vertical height that was the problem: the holder could mount ok, but she sits so low and the basket was too tall that it rubbed on the wheel.  No problem.  Mounting on the front was very easy.
I was pleasantly surprised that it is actually two parts: the basket and the holder.  The holder has the hooks and a velcro strap that holds the bottom portion against the front tube of the frame.  The bottom of the basket sets on two forward-pointing lower hooks and the top locks in by two extensions from the carry handles.  When you lift the handles, the basket can be inserted/removed easily; when in position, lowering the handles locks the basket onto the mount.  Quite chic!  So chic, in fact, that she doesn't even realize she's doing all the work!  And I'm enjoying her enjoying the ride!",So SHE Can Carry Stuff For A Change!,True,
B003B7QFE4,5.0,"Let me start by saying I have limited options for baskets on my bike.  I currently have a wee-hoo on the back (so can't use a back basket) and a co-rider on the front (so can't use any with mounting brackets as there's no room on my handlebars to mount anything).

I chose this one after looking at a few because it looked easy to mount, would fit my bike, wasn't too big, and the price was right.

After first opening the box I was impressed by how solid the basket is.  It's heavy duty wire, not the easily bendable junk baskets.  The attachement to hook it to the bike, however, wasn't looking so good.  One of the bottom hooks was bent differently than the other making the basket crooked when I hooked it together.  This was easily fixed by placing the piece on the ground and pressing firmly, bending the hook, until both were bent exactly the same.  I bent a little too much because then i couldn't get the basket on the top hooks at all, so I did the same thing but the opposite direction until the metal was bent just perfect to fit tightly on the basket.

Seeing a few other reviews of the basket bouncing had me worried that it would come off, but adjusting the metal hooks on the attachement piece made it a tight fit; it doesn't move around at all while i ride.  I recommend getting a good fit between the 2 pieces before attaching to your bike.

I've seen some reviews saying that the handles bounce up and unlock, but I've never had them even bounce a little, much less fall off! Just in case, I have a pair of butterfly hair clips that I use to secure the handles to the basket when it is on my bike, but when I forget to use them, I still don't have any trouble. My only problem was with the velcro fastener that keeps the base of the basket mount on the bike. The buckle snapped off within days of installing it, and I had to get a little creative with the velcro wrapping to get it to stay. Since them, I've been biking problem-free. Just be careful not to overload the basket, or the weight could tip your bike.","Great basket, but maybe a little cheaply made",True,
B003B7QFE4,5.0,"I love this basket! It's very easy to put on the bike, it attaches with hooks over the handlebars and a velcro strap.
The basket separates from the bracket simply by lifting the handles, so when you get to a store you can easily take it with you.
It is white vinyl coated metal, very sturdy and durable, and looks nice. I put a small towel in the bottom of mine so that small items do not fall through.

We go bike riding in the evenings for exercise and having this basket has added to my enjoyment. I can stop at the grocery store and pick up several things with no worries as this basket is strong and holds a good amount of stuff. I've filled it with heavier groceries (bag of sugar, cans of soup and tuna, grapefruits, etc) plus my water bottle, glasses case, keys, phone, bike chain, and still had some room, and with all of that weight, it did not effect steering at all.

I am an engineer, and the way they lock the basket to the bike it very well done. . . very secure, and yet a breeze to detach and re-attach.  This is a great purchase.

Also keeping the basket on the bike in the garage in South Florida did it no justice as the paint peeled off from the rust forming below it.

I've dropped mine a bunch of times with no damage and then just recently dropped it in the parking lot on concrete and just the cap broke, the glass did not break.

PROS:
-Glass! No funny tasting water.
-Looks pretty
-Handle on the cap makes it easy to carry as well as open
-Tight seal with no leaking
-Markings on the side of the sleeve to show you how much water you have (in both ml. and oz.)
-Wide opening makes it easy to clean and drink, no messing with small straws  and parts that can get moldy etc.
-I love the 22oz size for keeping at the office or taking to the gym.
-the design of the sleeve allows you to see how much water is still in the bottle

CONS: (or more aptly tradeoffs)
- With glass you have the tradeoff of it being heavier and breakable
- I also own a stainless steel insulated water bottle that keeps my water cold even in a hot car. Since this isn't insulated it won't keep your water cold.

Like another review said it is a wide mouth opening so be careful when you tilt it to drink as there is a high potential for spillage if agressively tilted. On that same topic the top is not as easy to get back on but really is not that big of an issue, my grip with it is it is not attached so you have to hold the cap or set it down while drinking, I was a hug fan of the plastic ones with the button pressed mouth that let you consume the beverage a little easier but hey at lkeast this isn't going to give me a toxic plastic stuff right?

B003BFYZE8,5.0,"I travel a lot for work and quickly realized how much waste I create by drinking bottled water all day. I hated throwing away all those bottles week after week, not to mention all the money spent. I'm also becoming increasingly aware that plastic cups and bottles are not good for you to always be drinking out of.

This 22 ounce bottle is fantastic. It holds so much that you inevitably drink so much more water too. The lid is great. It stays on securely and you don't have to worry about it being stored on its side in your bag. The handle is a great feature as well; Its just so much easier to carry or hold with a finger if you are carrying other things. Super convenient addition.

What sealed the deal for me is that you can leave the silicone on when you wash it. How convenient! Love this bottle. Part of it (unfortunately not all) is made in the USA too. This bottle is worth every penny.",Drinking water easier and less in the landfill,False,

B003C7WBCS,5.0,"The product came as pictured and the holster that comes with it actually seems to be of decent quality. I think the size is good for home use or to keep in your car if you want a bottle that has a decent amount of spray, but still is not too bulky. I would not recommend this particular bottle for wear on your person if you want to keep it concealed since there are many smaller bottles of pepper spray available, though the holster will work well for you if you aren't worried about hiding it. The bottle is 4.5 inches tall. I bought this in December 2011 and the expiration on the bottle is November 2015 so expect about 4 years of shelf life. Sabre is a reputable company and you definitely want to buy any type of personal defense item from a well known company so you don't find out upon use that it is not effective.

They are very tight, although I have an average sized head, causing a headache after just a few minutes. There is no way I could wear these for an extended time. The quality of construction is shameful, considering the price, as other reviewers have also posted. There is sloppy gluing of the ear pads and very cheap feeling plastic parts. The loose piece of foam that covers the battery in the ear compartment does not inspire confidence that it won't just fall out and become lost. Although it is American made, that does not necessarily denote high quality. There are very high quality Chinese made products (as well as poor quality).

Grabber Warmers.

My wife is just like so many women (though I'm sure some men fit this description, too) in that her extremities JUST CANNOT stay warm on cold days.  Perhaps other women can empathize here, too: not only is she uncomfortably cold when she's outside, but even when she's inside she keeps on feeling the discomfort for hours afterward, too.

But getting her these Grabber Warmers has REALLY helped her.  In her words, ""they are life savers.""

She said they're neither TOO hot or TOO cold, even when she's back inside, and she tells me they have really made a huge difference on winter days.  ""They're never too hot,"" she told me. ""They're just perfect.""

Additionally, they last for hours, just as they advertise. It's nice when a product does that.

Finally, I asked her to rate them and she never hesitated...and you can see her five stars at the top of this review.  We keep a stock of them ready ALL WINTER.  If you have cold extremities, you should, too.","A Real Life Saver (or, I Suppose, TOE Saver)",True,2.0

They take a little while to reach maximum temperature, so I suggest putting them on 30-45 minutes ahead of time so they're super toasty before you brave the elements (once you get out in the cold, heat loss will make them feel not as warm; that is normal). If you're having to brave arctic temps, I've found that putting these on your base layer of socks, and then adding another pair of socks over top of those helps to minimize heat loss even further. When you get back into a temperature controlled environment you'll be amazed at how warm they'll start to feel again. They do exactly what they're supposed to, and do it quite well.

I was tired of having mud and other junk flipped up on my shirt every time I rode, but I didn't want to get the full-on commuter fenders.  This fender is quite light, yet it blocks all the crap that my tires kick up and is substantial enough to not flop around while riding.  I am impressed how firmly it mounts to the bike with just the seat post strap.  I really hate bike parts that rattle when you hit bumps, but this thing is solid.  There's a cross-rib on the underside that I had to notch to clear my brake cable, but after that it went on great.  Once you adjust the strap length to fit your seat post, the buckle allows quick mounting/dismounting.
My only issue with it is the bright orange strap that is used to mount it to the seat post.  It's not that apparent from the photo, but with the rest of the parts being black, the blaze orange strap really sticks out.

B0049ZFP7U,5.0,"This fender is hard-core.

I originally tried out the SKS X-tra Dry Rear Bicycle Fender, but I am short and have a women specific frame. Thus, my seat post doesn't extend particularly far above my rear wheel. In order to fit the X-Tra Dry model on my bike, I would have had to angle the fender way up in the air. I've seen people around campus with that setup. It not only looks silly, but I doubt it deflects the spray well.

I was thrilled when I found this Dashblade model. I can attach it to my seat post and it angles straight out. It is wide and catches all the spit from my rear mountain bike tire. Tip: If you're worried about it being stolen, it's easy to detach and there is a triangular opening on the fender that you can use to attach it to your U lock. Otherwise, I've seen people wrap hose clamps around the quick release clasp to deter stealing.

Pros:
contours to wheel
sturdy
easy to attach and remove via quick release clasp
adjustable (both fender angle and length of fastening straps)
rubberized material on strap keeps it securely fastened
wide design catches mud well

Cons:
none really, it's not a beauty, but it's for a mountain bike

For any mountain bike users, I HIGHLY recommend this.

You simply cannot make these things leak! Beware as they ""spit"" from built up pressure when you first drink from them at times. Have NOT found a better water bottle for being active!",spill proof,True,
B004J8GCTW,5.0,"I am going to be totally honest.  I have used dozens of different types of water bottles and have never loved any as much as I do these.  When I drink water, I want to be able to DRINK the water - not have to suck it out or just received a few dribbles.  With these Contigo bottles, you actually get about as much water out at a time as you would drinking out of a regular cup - YAY!  Huge bonus points from me for this!!  Also, I love the ease of using them - simply push in the button on the back of the lip and tip up - out comes your water.  When you are finished, simply release the button and your cup is sealed - no leaks at all.  I have tossed my bottle around several times - upside down, sideways, you name it and no leaks.  Another thing I love?  The handy clip!  It is beyond awesome!  Now I can easily clip my water bottle to my purse strap, my tote bag, anything and I am good to go.

The only downfall to this product is that it does sweat.  I simply put a can koozie around the bottom of the bottle - it only reaches about half way up, but it works great.  Keeps the ice and water colder longer and no drips from the sweat get on the table or where ever I sit it.  It is also nicer to have the dry koozie to hang on to rather than the wet, slippery bottle as well.

My two kids love these bottles as well!  I had originally bought the 3 pack to have one for me and one for each of them to take to school.  Then I came across the smaller kid sized ones and they decided they would like to have the smaller ones.  I ordered a set of those as well and the kids are in love.  Now they use these taller ones around the house and the shorter ones will make the trip to school and back with them.  After reading the reviews previous to buying these, I do want to mention that I have made these strictly water bottles - no pop, milk, etc - simply because of the reviewers that have brought up concern about the ability to clean within the lids mechanism.

I loved this set so much that I even bought another as a wedding gift!  I highly recommend these bottles and am so thrilled that my search for an ideal water bottle has come to an end!",As close to perfect as you can get!,True,

For mornings in the 30s, this over an under armour base and long sleeve jersey have been fine.  When it falls into the 20s or teens, or when there is a lot of wind, I add a fleece layer.

B004N628JS,2.0,"I bought these for the single zip off sleeve.  Which means there are two zippers (one on each side) but the sleeve is all one piece between the two sides.

Couple other aspects I am not a fan of:
1) The back pocket.  It has a zipper is from top to bottom, so the opening is sideways making is easier for items to potentially fall out if not closed well.  I prefer the dumper pocket in the back (like most jackets have) so that you can ""effortless"" put things in and reach things without worrying too much about zipping it up.

2) There is no way to carry the jacket if you want to take it off complete.  Other jackets I have will collapse into the rear pocket and that pocket has an elastic belt built in so you can take off the jacket fold it away and wear the pouch/belt around your waist and continue riding.

The removable sleeves are nice for when it warms up during a ride, although they're a bit tough to remove while on the bike.  I find that I have to stop briefly to remove them.  The pocket zippers can be a little hard to operate with winter gloves on, but that's pretty normal.

Many reviewers claim these jackets run small, but I generally wear a Large regular jacket, and expected a cycling jacket to be more form-fit. I am 5'9"" tall, 209 lbs.; which translates to: skinny arms, flabby chest, flabby gut, thick neck. The jacket is very well tapered in the arms for cycling, but I still have room for a thermal layer or two if they are thin. If you're more fit, I suppose the chest/waist might end-up being a bit baggy rather than my ""it fits barely but comfortably."" Muscular arms need not apply. So for me this jacket was ""true to size,"" and will stay that way as I lose weight.

I've found Pearl Izumi products fit me in general, and their hi-viz (""screaming yellow"") is one of the most obnoxious (i.e. visible!) in the cycling clothing I've tried; so I am somewhat partial to their gear these days.

It is super light weight and thin, but despite feeling frail it seems remarkably durable. Packs really tiny, smaller than the generic windbreaker I had been using. A little more cold than a generic ripstop nylon windbreaker, but not badly so, and in some ways will make this a better all-season jacket. I'm partial to using multiple thin layers I can shed as needed anyway.

I did not get this for rain (I have dedicated jacket and pants for rain riding), so likely will not test that. Haven't tried removing the sleeves yet, too cold around here still.

For comparison, I did try-on a Performance Bicycle version of this jacket at one point: those run smaller, and while the sleeves are bigger (for you muscular types), they are alot longer too. I tried the XL (the Large was too tight) and the sleeves went way past my fingertips.

ADDENDUM 1/27/14: As mentioned above, I bought a second jacket in black. The Screaming Yellow will be for daytime recreational riding on my recumbent, the black one will be for commuting where I want a little less ""eeek"" factor (since I already have a reflective vest). BE AWARE the ""Black"" picture for the product shows ""Black Plaid"" and the jacket received was solid black with white accents (white zipper, etc.). I had a feeling that might happen, so was okay with that.",First impressions are promising,True,
B004N628JS,5.0,"Bought this jacket mainly for colder-weather bicycle commuting.  The zip-off sleeves come off quickly, and are a handy feature in spring and fall where morning and evening rides require different amounts of clothing.  I'm on the fat side of XL most of the time, and with this jacket in XL I am able to layer a couple light wool sweaters underneath (at that point I'm filling it out quite nicely, look out ladies).  With the aforementioned layering, I've used this jacket down to about 0F.  If I have any complaints it would be that the construction seems sort of flimsy, but it's held up for over a year now so I guess I was wrong about that!",Nice jacket,True,
B004N628JS,5.0,"Unlike the Izumi jerseys, the jacket fits as expected.  It does a good job stopping wind.  This plus good thermal layers will have you ready for a cold weather ride.  The back pockets are nice since you can't easily get to your jersey pockets while wearing the jacket.  The grippers don't do a great job though of stopping the jacket from riding up your back while riding.","Good fit, Stops wind",True,
B004N628JS,4.0,"So far I've only had the chance to wear this jacket once. I read that some other reviewers said it runs small, but that is not my experience. I'm 6'2'', weigh 185 lbs, and this jacket is a bit baggy for a Large. I considered returning it but got lazy and now it is mine. It did keep me warm on my morning ride. I pulled off the arms when I warmed up. I couldn't imagine doing this while on the bike, but with a quick dismount I was able to remove them fairly quickly.",Solid jacket,True,
B004N628JS,5.0,"This is a really nice jacket. I bought it too large though. It ran bigger than I expected. Usually these jackets run really small so I order it a size larger. I wish I just had ordered the size I normally do. My fault. It is very nice fabric, nice and soft, and breathable too.",Biking jacket,True,
B004N628JS,5.0,"I bought this to act as the top most layer of my winter Cycling kit. Sizing chart was accurate. It's a great top layer, well designed with detachable sleeves for the inevitable warm up you get once underway.

Pretty decent water repulsion. It's good for 20 mins of light rain with little seepage, but the heat retention goes a long way to mitagate the chills of being caught within a deluge.

Honestly, It might be too warm for the gentle Georgia winters. I've worn it a half dozen rides this winter season, and I've take it off ( entirely ) on all but once. Most of these rides have been ~ 45 - 50 degrees. On the 25 Degree ride, I kept it on the whole way.
It's compact and light enough material to cram into the center/back pocket of the jersey underneath, detached sleeves no problems.

Only complaint = I bought two of these, one for myself and one for my wife as we cycle together and she feels strongly that we match... ( both White Jerseys ).  The pattern and layout of the ladies version is cooler looking than the men's, not sure why.

B004N628JS,5.0,"I recently was riding in Pisgah National Forest.  It was 33 degree fahrenheit at the time, and all that I had to have on was a long sleeve t-shirt and this jacket.  It is warm without making me sweat.  A nice additional that I forgot about until last night is that the sleeves zip off, and as a bonus when you zip them off, both come off as one piece.  Also, there are many vents in the jacket to keep it breathable.  Highly recommend for winter riding.",Great Jacket for winter or cool riding,True,
B004N628JS,4.0,Great jacket!  It fits tight which is okay with me! The only complaint is that the cuffs need to fit tighter!!!,Classic!,True,

B004N628JS,5.0,"Hard to convey how much I love this jacket.  Had an earlier version for years, and didn't think they could improve upon it, but I was wrong.  I've had this version for . . . going into my third year, now?  Have worn it a ton as a shell for winter cycling, or as a warmup outer layer for cyclocross races.  The zip-off sleeves make it incredibly versatile:  the one piece I'm sure to pack with me on any sort of trip, most seasons, if there's any chance I'll be outside exercising at all (which is usually a given).  This past year, I started running in it, mostly just the vest so far, and it keeps the windchill at bay perfectly on chilly fall days you don't necessarily want to wear a ton of insulation for:  usually a long-sleeve base layer and this vest is perfect for me, lately.  Yesterday, the conditions finally warranted a run in the full jacket, sleeves and all:  about 40 degrees and mildly raining the whole time, along muddy dirt roads:  that's what inspired me to finally write a review.  For me, this one jacket has been a perfect shell for year-round cycling, and so far it's proving perfect for running as well.",Versatile shell for cool- or cold-weather endurance activities,False,
B004N628JS,2.0,"I wear it on a cloudy morning when the temperature runs below 50 and lot wind. I only wear a short sleeve base layer inside and then this jacket.

I felt obvious difficulty to ride my first 10mi, at first I was so disappointed that my body degrades so quickly that I just didn't ride for about 3 weeks and I can't even make it. Fortunately at that time the sun rises and so as the temperature, I took off the sleeve and only wear it as a vest. It was so different.

I think the design runs too loose, when I have the sleeve on I think I was like a parachute...maybe I would survive wearing this jumping off a plane :) I don't get it why they design the sleeve so loose, you won't wear a sweater when ride, will you? (maybe I am wrong, maybe in far north you will really need thick cloth when ride)

And another thing I don't like is body is also too loose. I put my iphone and one energy bar in the pocket, when at the aerobar position, those things dangles there and keep knocking my thigh, which is annoying.

I don't think I ordered a larger size as the length of sleeve and body is just fit. I won't wear it unless it is really necessary in the future. Maybe I'll just wear it as a vest to keep my core body against wind, and wear a thick long sleeve tight top as a base layer.",Too much wind resistance,True,
B004N628JS,4.0,"This is a really good value. One item that is both a shell and a vest and works fairly well. It is very easy to remove the sleeves to convert and they come off in one piece. The nice part about the way the sleeves come off is the back section then opens up a vented mesh area on the vest, giving better venting when using in ""vest"" mode.

The front pockets are a nice touch I guess, but I don't typically use front pockets on bike gear. The rear pocket is one big pocket that sips from the side - a bit odd in my opinion though I guess you could though the sleeves in here that way. I would prefer at least two back pockets.

My primary complaint is about fit - though this is very personal. I find it just a bit too loose. I got a medium, and am typically a M or L depending on the cycling gear. This M is awfully large on me, leaving extra windage. Lots of room in front. I am not skinny biker, I have a bit of a stomach, but this has room for a much larger gut then I have. I would be concerned that a S might be to small in other dimensions, but it would probably work. For comparison, I have a Gore vest in medium that has a very form fit but really is about perfect for me. I wish this fit more like that. Consider ordering one size smaller if your not sure.","Good value for convertible jacket, but could be better",False,
B004N628JS,5.0,"I'm 5'-7"" and 170 lbs and usually wear a 16.5""/32"" dress shirt.  The medium fits perfectly.  The sleeves are a tad long, but I don't mind because they won't creep partway up my forearms if I'm in the drops for an extended period.  Converting this to the vest is easy.",Great adaptability,True,
B004N628JS,3.0,"Some folks here have commented particularly on the arms, and I'd say I have to agree.  I'm stocky but not huge by any means and the X-Large was somewhat restrictive in the arms for me.  I'm going to return the jacket and probably not bother getting another.",Just watch your sizes.,True,
B004N628JS,4.0,"Overall I like the jacket, but it isn't the most insulated thing, i.e., wind gets through, and it should not.",Good Jacket,True,
B004N628JS,4.0,"I'm 5'-7"", 140lbs, 31"" waist, 36"" chest. I own a Small PI vest which has a snug body hugging fit. I wanted the jacket between snug and a bit loose, the latter like my Novara convertible jacket, so I ordered a medium. Big mistake.

CONS:
1. Sizing: The shoulders are a true medium but not the chest/waist nor the arm lengths. Zipping the jacket then pulling the chest fabric outwards left me with 7-9"" of extra fabric. I like my jackets a bit loose but was not expecting to wear a tent. And the sleeves are 35"" in length.
2. Amazon charged an additional $11 to exchange medium to small.
3. Sleeve fabric on the thin side so riding in temps less than 40 degree is not appropriate as wind chill comes into play.
4. Not too keen on rear vertical zipper. Easy to open but hard to close [zipping upwards on loose material.

PROS:
See update

****************************************************************************************************************************
04.02.2013 * UPDATE *

Took the bike out for ride this morning in cool mid to high 50's overcast temps.
1. The small fits as a small, not snug and a bit loose [perfect], but the sleeve lengths are 3 inches longer than they should be.
2. Very snug underarm fit which disappears after a while. It's not the sleeves but the underarm seam.
3. Additional [thicker] front panel fabric for wind protection/blocking.
4. Sleeve fabric is thinner and does little for wind proofing/wind blocking, more like wind resistant.
5. Elastic waist cincher and lots of pockets.

Overall not bad but pricey. Would give this convert jacket 3.5 *'s.","Sizing differs per product, xtra exchange charges",True,
B004N628JS,5.0,"Just this once I ignored my usual PI size of medium, being influenced by the comments that this tends to run small.  Got the large, and it hung off me.  I exchanged it for a medium and all is right with the world again - perfect fit.  Everyone's story is different and maybe I'm just a mutant, but if you have a size that tends to work for you with PI gear consider sticking with it.","Great jacket, sizing issues",True,

- style
- pockets
- can convert easily into a vest
- good wind breaker

- don't get oil on it, the white will stain.  if you do, use dish soap immediately.",Great jacket for different temperatures,True,2
B004N628JS,5.0,"I've only worn this jacket once, while cycling on a cool 60 degree day. Very bright and easy for traffic to see. It breaks the wind well and keeps you warm enough on a cool day, but I doubt it will work in temps below 50 degrees. It's a thin material, so it will only keep you so warm. I hope to get some more use in the Spring and update my review.",Cycling Jacket,True,
B004N628JS,5.0,"As with everything I've bought so far from Pearl iZUMi, the jacket has been great! It has definitely lived up to the brand quality, and I've loved it for fall and early winter riding. I don't know what all needs to be said about it, so here is a simple list of the things I love and the few things I dislike.

Pros (in no particular order):
- Ultra lightweight.
- Superior wind blocking.
- Very warm.
- Zippered pockets.
- Removable sleeves. (Can be worn as a vest.)
- Form-fitting.
- Very durable (despite its light, thin feel).

Cons:
- Slightly awkward sleeve removal/attachment.
- Rear pocket awkward to access.
- Neck zips up a hair too high.
- Pocket interiors are mesh, so sweat comes in contact with stored items (i.e. you need to ""baggie"" a cell phone).",Great! Consistent With The Brand.,True,9
B004N628JS,5.0,"I have used this jacket for a number of rides some down to 25* so far (with layering) and have been very pleased with it. Great for cutting the wind, good venting and did a great job shedding the rain in the few storms that I have been in. I even took a tumble this last week and even though dirty and covered with rocks and prickers from the shrubbery I went through it had no flaws..","Tough, Bright and fits great",True,2
B004N628JS,5.0,"There is a spectrum of waterproof/breathability.  At one end, you have waterproof.  At the other end, you have breathability.  This particular garment lands closer to the breathability end of the spectrum.  It's exactly what I was hoping for when I purchased it.  I commute on my bike.  I generally ride 30-minutes or less, in-and-out of traffic.  If the weather is really bad, I drive or take the bus.  I wanted a jacket that didn't cause me to build heat on my commute, and I was willing to sacrifice an element of water/wind proofing.  This jacket is perfect for my needs.  It's highly visible, blocks most of the wind, and blocks light/moderate rain for short durations.  In other situations, where real protection from weather is needed, this jacket would not suffice.

The garment is convertible.  I haven't used it as a vest yet, but I did break it down to check it out.  I have to say that disassembly and reassembly was a touch more complex and time consuming than I suspected, but it only takes a minute or two.

As a commuting jacket, I wish it had more reflective tape/piping.",Where this lands on the waterproof / breathability spectrum -,True,2
B004N628JS,3.0,The jacket fits well. It is definitely a nice looking piece to have out on the road. Maybe it was just me but I thought I would be getting quite a bit more resistance against water and wind as the title of the product suggest than the actually jacket actually has. I wouldn't suggest using this as your only barrier in the rain.,"Great Jacket, a little bit pricey for being the level of weather resistance",True,5
B004N628JS,5.0,"I worried that the zipper would be annoying to remove the sleeves, but it really wasn't that bad.  Only 2 zippers on the front of the vest (the smartly placed zippers do not rub on the skin), and off goes the sleeves.  My husband looks awesome in it and the fit is great for a man.  My husband's medium Pearl Izumi Elite Convertible jacket folds up a little smaller than my XS Sugoi Versa Jacket (due to my jacket has magnets).  I am kinda jealous and starting to wish that I had bought the women's Pearl Izumi Elite Convertible jacket instead.",Great looking jacket,True,
B004N628JS,5.0,"This is an extremely well designed light weight convertible riding jacket. The high vis yellow is bright and visibility always helps when riding.  The design, materials and construction of this jacket are superior, just what I've come to expect from pearl Izumi.  Fabric has a nice soft hand for a wind breaker.  Zippers on pockets are beautifully installed and nearly invisible.  Fabric around the collar is soft and absorbent. Well ventilated to breathe while riding.  Sleeves remove fairly easily even while wearing though not while riding.  Sleeves can be pulled on  quickly while wearing and Velcro will hold them snugly in place, but rezipping the  front sleeve attaching zippers really requires removing the jacket.",Perfect riding jacked,True,2

B005DWER40,5.0,"I basically got this basket because my mountain bike with front suspension doesn't allow for installing any other basket in the front. Simply, the brakes/shifters wires are taking up the whole space and any extended basket must be mounted on the wheel which doesn't work for the front suspension.

The basket and its bracket are of very high quality. It is well built and feels very sturdy. The basket was very easy to install and very easy to attach/detach. I tried to load it with heavy stuff from the supermarket (several pounds, not quite sure how much, but they were heavy), and the basket was fine with them. No problems.

The only thing I don't like about the basket is that, even without any load, it feels to be ""heavy"" on the bike when it is parked. You don't feel this problem when driving the bike, but you feel when trying to park it. Basically, the front wheel with the handle becomes so unbalanced to a point that the bike can't be parked stand still (using its little leg) with the basket installed. It will tend to tip over very easily!

B005DWFVGI,2.0,"More evidence that there's no free lunch. I really wanted a Burley Nomad I saw on Craigslist for $100, but I was too slow and missed it. I should have either waited to find another used Burley or just paid the steep price for a new one. I wanted those three things you can't have all at the same time: fast, good, and cheap.

The Allen Explorer trailer is okay, and I do use it every week for groceries for me and the wife. For that purpose it gets me by with no problems. If that's all I wanted to do with a bike trailer it would be fine.

However, I have just started cycling to gigs (I'm a musician) and when I need to bring my own amp it's really awkward. When I think about covering real miles with a trailer my gut feeling is that this one is heavy, slow, and prone to wearing out faster than one made with an aesthetic/ethic/IDK similar to the bicycle itself - you know, ultralight, rigid, smooth rolling, made to last for decades or more.

Lately every time I have to drive my car I curse this trailer and start thinking about biting the bullet and paying for a Burley.

Besides the weight and general clunkiness of the trailer, a couple things stand out as reservations regarding a recommendation on the Allen Explorer. First, the tires are pretty weak, as others have pointed out. 30 PSI is no joke - I had a blowout after I forgot and pumped them up to 50, which is what is embossed on the tire itself; but I was able to ride home with no inner tube - even with a load of groceries - so mark a point for the cheap tires. The other thing that bugs me is that the floor of the trailer is nowhere close to rigid. It hasn't caused any problems yet, but it makes feel less enthusiastic about this trailer, and pretty much rules it out as a long-distance candidate.

For anyone thinking about getting this trailer, I would just advise you to think long and hard about what you might possibly want to do with it. Don't be like me; I've had this thing less than a year and I'm already thinking about putting down another $340 for a trailer that is very similar but very much better. I'll be lucky to get a third of my money back out of the Allen trailer.",good mate for a department store bike,False,4

B005DWFVGI,3.0,Wish it came with two bike connectors instead of one.,Three Stars,True,
B005DWFVGI,5.0,"Let's get the big controversy out of the way first: The trailer as a whole is great but as others have reported the tires that come with it are junk. But it's so inexpensive - I paid a few pennies more than eighty-four dollars here on Amazon - I didn't hold the tires against it. Since I read the reviews before making my purchase, I expected the tires to be low quality Chinese junk. I don't know if the tubes are equally crappy because I haven't yet needed to remove the tires to look at the tubes. I haven't had any trouble with them yet but if I have flats or blowouts I've got the right size tubes in my spare parts box already since the front wheel of my recumbent uses the same size tubes (16""/305 x 1.75""). If I ever take the trailer any real distance I'll bring spare tubes for it just as I bring spare tubes for my bike on such a trip. And while the tires are junk they aren't going to be holding the weight of an adult, only a max of 70lbs and usually a lot less, so I don't think they'll be a problem. If the tires do prove to be a problem there are a bunch of 16""/305 tires in my local bike shop and here on Amazon, some relatively inexpensive but plenty good enough (such as Kenda Kwests) and others a bit more expensive but really, really good (such as Schwalbe Big Apples or Marathon GGs). For now I'll use the included tires and tubes until they wear out or cause a problem; I am prepared for but don't expect a problem and they should last a year or more before needing replacement.

I am moving along an asymptote toward a nearly car-free lifestyle. I do most of my local travel, errands, and visiting using a bike; mostly my Sun EZ-1 Lite recumbent although I also have an early-90s Schwinn hybrid and a little Dahon folder. The one thing I found myself still wanting a car for is to do shopping trips that involve bulk items such as paper towels, larger potted plants, etc. The solution to this is a cargo trailer. There are lots available and I did my research, eventually settling on the Burley Travoy. Unfortunately, there is no good way to get the Travoy's hitch to work with my EZ-1 because it has no seat tube and the rack is too low to the ground; too bad because I really liked the ability to use the Travoy cargo trailer as a handcart. After spending over a month trying to come up with inventive ways to get the Travoy hitched to my EZ-1, I went back to research mode and narrowed my choices down to the Burley Nomad and the Allen Sports ACT200 Explorer. The Nomad is a very high-quality trailer from a company well-known for its high-quality products, with more interior cargo space and a higher weight capacity than the Explorer. The Nomad is also lighter because it has an aluminum frame vs the Explorer's steel frame and a much better-designed hitch using an elastomer vs the Explorer's universal joint. But the Explorer had two things going for it that I liked a lot: It could be quickly converted to a convenient handcart mode and it was way, way, WAY less expensive than the Nomad. Even at the highest prices I saw for the Explorer (around one-hundred twenty five) and the lowest I saw for the Nomad (around two-hundred thirty) there was a one-hundred dollar difference - you can pretty much buy two or three Explorers for the price of one Nomad. Even if the reviews claiming that the Explorer's included tires and tubes were so bad they would need to be immediately replaced were true, the Explorer remained a bargain. So I decided to at least give the Explorer a try since the price was so appealing and it had that handcart mode.

The Explorer cargo trailer comes almost fully assembled in its box. Just lift it out of the box, unzip the zipper, pull the wheels out of the cargo compartment, pop the wheels on, then attach the hitch arm to the trailer. This takes barely longer to do than it does to read about. After that, attach the hitch plate to your bike's rear axle. I purchased two extra hitch plates directly from Allen Sports (they're not available here on Amazon) in order to have a hitch plate on all three of my bikes. This is also trivially easy to do, although it's possible with a quick-release rear hub that you'll find that the hitch plate is thick enough so that the skewer won't be long enough with the hitch plate attached. If that's the case, go to your local bike shop or look around here on Amazon or another online store for a longer skewer; they're not expensive and they're easy to find. The hitch plate fit fine on my Schwinn (quick-release skewer) and Dahon (nutted axle) but not on my EZ-1 (quick-release skewer) but I had a longer skewer for the EZ-1 sitting in my spare parts box so that didn't slow me down.

I did experience a moment of confusion when attaching the wheels. At first, I thought that the wheel axles were supposed to go under the trailer bed, partially supporting the trailer bed. But the first time I put a load into the trailer bed, the trailer bed sagged down and the axles poked into the sides of the trailer. I communicated via email with Allen Sports and they told me that the axles are SUPPOSED to poke into the sides of the trailer and in fact the cargo compartment is reinforced in that area to prevent damage. This is not apparent in any of the pictures or videos I saw before my purchase but you'll see the reinforced patches right away as you pull the trailer out of its box; I thought they were just decorative at first.

Before putting the wheels on, pressurize them. The tires on the wheels are rated for 30-60PSI but there is a stick-on label on the wheels that says ""30 PSI MAX"" so pump them to 30PSI, no higher. If you don't have a pump with a pressure gauge, get one. If you over pressurize and the crappy tubes pop the crappy tires off the rims or the crappy tubes =POP= that's probably your fault, not the fault of Allen Sports or Amazon. By the way, the wheels are mostly plastic but they seem to be perfectly round and straight; weird if you're used to ""normal"" bike wheels with separate hub, spokes, and rim but they seem to work fine and certainly there should be no need for truing these wheels or using rim tape to protect the inner tube from the nonexistent spokes.

The universal joint at the end of the hitch arm which attaches to the hitch plate on the bike works fine. It's a good inexpensive way to allow the bike to move in relation to the trailer without damaging the hitch arm, trailer, or bike. The trailer can flip over without affecting your bike (other than the drag if you keep riding, of course), or you can lay your bike down on the ground without affecting the trailer. An elastomer would be better as a universal joint can get stiff or even experience damage if movement occurs around more than one axis simultaneously; but of course the universal joint is much less expensive and that's what you get with the Explorer: An inexpensive solution that works.

I don't notice the empty trailer behind my bike at all, except for the noise of it bouncing around on the potholes. The first couple of times I used it on smooth roads I had to keep looking back to be sure it was still there; when empty, it doesn't affect the handling of the bike at all and even though it's 20lbs empty I didn't notice it even on uphills. Loaded with 60lbs of soil from the garden store, sure, I noticed it going uphill but on the flats or downhills it was like it wasn't there except when starting or stopping. Of course it's harder to ride uphill pulling more weight and it takes a little more effort to accelerate and you have to give yourself more room to brake to a stop from a high speed. Physics, DUH! The trailer itself, however, rides better with a load than without because at 20lbs empty it bounces around on rough road quite a bit but even a modest load, another 20lbs or so, helps to keep it from bouncing around. Low-pressure tires designed for shock absorption, such as the Schwalbe Big Apple, would probably reduce the bouncing while unloaded.

The zippered compartment, when zipped closed, is 26"" long/19"" wide/7"" high which looks and functions larger than it sounds. It's good for small items and pizzas. For most shopping, the zippered compartment works nicely and holds quite a bit of stuff, more than the two baskets on my Schwinn combined. It's also good for keeping things inside clean (freshly washed laundry, for example) and dry (the cargo compartment isn't waterproof but if you get caught in a sprinkle for a short time it's better than nothing). The cargo compartment also has an interior divider that can be zipped up or folded flat, leaving a slightly larger space in the rear and a slightly smaller space in the front. It's hard to get stuff into or out of the rear space when the divider is zipped up because the top cover gets in the way. It might be useful for people carrying only a few items, or if you want to be able to reach some items easily while keeping other stuff covered. But I haven't used the divider yet, I just keep it unzipped and folded flat, leaving one large space in the cargo compartment. I often find myself unzipping the top, laying it mostly flat on the trailer bed, and then putting bulky items on top of that. The interior side panels have three tie-down ring anchors each and I keep three long bungies and a cargo net to use with them; the cargo net for multiple smaller items and the bungies for big items like a box I have to bring to the post office.

One of the things I like most about the Explorer is handcart mode. To go from trailer mode to handcart mode, just detach the hitch arm from your bike, unscrew a big black knob on the trailer, swivel the hitch arm from horizontal to vertical, then screw down that big black knob to tighten the hitch arm in that position. It's great for shopping because you  fill it up as you walk around the store, unload it at checkout, then load it back up again after paying with no need to waste plastic or paper bags. No need to compete with other shoppers for a cart because you have your own and no worries that you're buying too much stuff to bring home in a single trip. It's not quite as useful or convenient to use this way as a Travoy, but at 1/2-1/3 the price of a Travoy the Explorer is plenty good enough.

To repeat the point of the first paragraph of this review: Please note that my 5-star rating is not a comment on the quality of the tires and tubes. I've seen the tires, I agree with other reviews that they are crap. I haven't seen the tubes (because they're inside the tires and I haven't yet needed to remove the tires) yet I have no doubt that they're crap, too. But I haven't had issues with them and I have spare tubes on hand if needed, and replacement tires are easy to get if and when needed. The welds on the steel parts as well as all the other bits of the trailer don't have the quality one would get from Burley but everything is functional and strong. Given the price, this trailer is an excellent value. You can pay more (a LOT more) and get better quality. You can't pay less; I don't think there is even a half-decent cargo trailer made by anyone available for a lower price. The handcart mode is invaluable for me and the standard axle hitch attachment makes it usable with any bike, including my EZ-1. I would recommend it for anyone looking for a bargain cargo trailer and for whom the 70lb weight capacity is sufficient.

edit 2015-01-17: I've been using the trailer frequently for a couple of months now and I remain very pleased with it. However, note my comment above about the universal joint. Last night while bringing home pizza for the family, the joint locked up and the trailer flipped onto its side while I was making a turn. I had to disconnect the hitch and ""work it"" with my hands to loosen it up, after which I reattached it and completed the ride home without incident. I have a feeling this will happen every now and then. Infrequently, but it will happen. Universal joints usually work fine, but they can lock up as mine did last night. While I'm not deducting a star, it would be better if Allen Sports replaced the universal joint with an elastomer or even a metal spring.",Quality of some parts fairly low but this is a great value for a new cargo trailer.,True,5

B005DWFVGI,5.0,"Past week I went to supermarket and I bought 20 bottles of wine and a six of yogurts, No Big Problem for the cargo trailer.
Some times I use it to take the trash from my house to the trash container, just I have to move the arm from horizontal position to vertical and that's all",Nice and strong Cargo trailer,True,
B005DWFVGI,4.0,"The trailers frame is very well constructed and sturdy. The fabric enclosing the frame is also rugged. The zippers which secure the top are good. There is very little assembly with no tools required. Just loosen up the quick release for your bike's rear tire and mount the front hitch and then attach the towing bar to that hitch and the one on the trailer using the provided pins which have spring clips to keep them in place.

Oh, and air up the tires and pop the wheels onto the trailer. Yeah, about the tires... This is what makes an otherwise great product not quite so great. I guess it's also why they can sell it fort such a reasonable price. These are the thinnest, cheapest crap tires and inner tubes, like something for a kid's toy you'd expect to be worn out just a few days after Christmas. Although aired properly to the recommended pressure (30 to 40 pounds) one blew out within a week just sitting on the patio and the other one was already half flat from a leaky valve.

However, since the rest of the trailer is of good quality and the price was so low, it was worth it to me to invest in a pair of REAL tires and inner tubes so I could put the trailer to practical use for the purpose intended - the occasional jaunt to the grocery store.

The tires and inner tubes are standard 16 inch size available at most bike shops.

I would have replaced the plastic wheels with standard metal ones too, but the wheels are not standard. They have a quick release thing built into the hub which snaps onto the bike sort of like a socket wrench onto a ratchet. So you can't mount regular bike wheels on the trailer.

But the plastic wheels are of pretty good quality and rugged, so, after 4 months of occasional use, they are still holding up okay. As far as I can tell there are no bearings inside the trailer frame where the axle of the wheels attach, but the wheel axles and the shafts they fit into on the trailer are all made of steel so it seems rugged enough for many miles of use, although you might want to spray some wd-40, light oil, or something in there if you are planning to put lots of miles of heavy use on the trailer

Unloaded, the trailer is quite light, and I've had it flip over once while going around a tight corner making a right turn a bit too fast. Due to the pivoting action of the hitch this did not cause me to tumble too, though, and the trailer suffered no damage, but it did make me start exercising more caution. Fully loaded with a week or two worth of groceries, I doubt that the trailer could flip over unless you are very fast and careless.

One other note: If, like me, you are a bit paranoid about the trailer or it's contents being stolen while you are at the mall or whatever, a Master lock, model 140, is just the right size to fit into the hitches. I use one at both ends, instead of the spring clip pins that come with the trailer, to secure the towing bar to the bike and also to the trailer. I also use a tiny padlock to secure the zipper pull tabs together so the trailer's cover can't be opened easily.

In conclusion, this is a good little trailer at such a reasonable cost that it's worth upgrading.",Good trailer but lousy tires,True,41
B005DWFVGI,4.0,I use this trailer to haul my gear to work for business trips. It is sturdy and pulls nicely. It has eyelets to bungee items on top for extra capacity. Very easy to attach and detach. Wheels have sealed bearings and come off by pushing a release on the hub. My only issue was with the tubes bursting at the seams and the tire bead coming loose. This was with the recommended 30 psi. I purchased different tubes and used liquid tape on one of the rims to keep the the tubes from pushing the tire bead off the rim. Now all is good!,Nice functional trailer,True,5

B005IMGT8W,1.0,This company is fraudulent they make a decent product but there is literally no warranty support as claimed. Every review Ive read online has parts missing when received.

B005IMGT8W,3.0,"This set is unnecessarily expensive. I own Cap Dumbbells, fixed, exactly like these but uncoated with rubber, just not the whole set. I've purchased them from Amazon and from Dicks, who also sells them. They are good Dumbbells, solid, straight, so-so knurling.

Here's the skinny.  You can hold a 5-pound Cap dumbbell in the same hand as any other dumbbell simultaneously.  Try it when you see these at a big box store,  the five pounders are tiny, with tiny heads, and when you cross the handles, they are easily lifted together, one hands with any other heavier dumbbell.  I have fairly small hands for a guy and I can do it.  When my wife dies it, she likes to use eight inch Velcro straps, just Anazin search them, to hold them together; I just do it without straps.

If you can do as I say, and the weights individually in Amazon are cheap and free shipping, you can do as I did.

These prices are on Amazon now.  Two pairs of five pounders is 20 bucks.  A pair of 15 pounders is 30 smackeroulians. Okay, so what does that give you?  Per hand, you can lift 5, 10, 15, or 20 pounds, depending on what you hold (e.g. Two fine pounders per hand s ten pounds). That might be enough for a person with a total outlay of fifty bucks.

Want more? If you buy two 25-pounders for 40 more clams total (based on current price), now you can do 25 and 30 pound lifts per hand.  You would have a total investment of ninety bucks.  Only ninety bucks to go up to thirty pounds (stand sold separately, if you care about such things). That is much, much cheaper than the price of this set.

If you want more than thirty pounds per dumbbell, buy a PowerBlock Elite set (I've done an extensive review of that set) or an Ironmaster set...much better use of your money.

Hope that helps. Some may not want to hold two Dumbbells at a time...all I can say is to try it when you hit the big box store next time you're there. Hope this helped.",Buy uncoated.,False,2

B005IMGT8W,5.0,"Positives:
Small footprint, compact and stylish, looks good in any home gym particularly those cramped for space. The grey and black compliment the standard color for all of the equipment I have in my gym. The weights are perfect in size and dimension, they do not roll when placed on the floor and you can add additional weights from just about any local department or sports store as you develop and your requirements change.
Negatives:
The stand isn't straight when put together (tweaked a little) this results in the stand not being able to sit flush on a flat surface. However, when the dumbbells are on the rack, it is very stable. There is a very strong chemical smell coming off the product (It maybe that the paint is off-gassing, not sure) but over the few weeks I have ad the product in my gym the smell appears to be getting weaker.
Overall, I am please with the purchase, they match, look good, have a small compact footprint and do what dumbbells are supposed to do. I think it was money well spent.",Love Them!,True,3

B005WT02ES,5.0,"I am really happy with these gloves. I was previously using a cheap pair of touchscreen gloves but they were very thin and not ideal for cold winter weather. They were also getting a bit worn and actually did not work very well in that I needed to press very hard on the touchscreen in order for them to work.

These gloves are mostly what I have been looking for. They are thick and warm for the winter yet are not overly bulky or too puffy to use with a touchscreen device. They are comfortable and are made of 2% spandex material which stretches and conforms to your hand and finger shape. I also like the rubber-like grippers on the lower parts of the fingers and throughout the palms of the gloves which help grip your device and keep it from slipping out of your hands. These gloves also have extra long material at the base of the gloves which helps keep your wrists warm and keeps cold air from getting in.

These gloves are unique in that the entire glove is made from conductive yarn/fiber. Most touchscreen gloves only have conductive material on two or three fingertips but with these gloves you can use any part of the gloves with a touchscreen. These gloves also seem to have more and/or better conductive material than other touchscreen gloves I have tried.

B0067PIEVE,5.0,"I have been using these for six months. I just ordered six more boxes. I do a lot of shooting, bench rest, skeet, handgun and hunting. I have used all types of hearing protection and these are the easiest, most comfortable and effective for me. Large shooter's muffs provide a little more sound reduction but they are bulky and contact the rifle or shotgun stock and interfere with proper shouldering and aiming. Foam plugs are difficult to get reinserted when you remove them to listen to conversation. These reseal your in your ears easily. A few minutes after you put them in you forget they are there. My most recent outing was a week long pheasant hunting trip to South Dakota.  At the end of a drive in the field I would pull one slightly out to unseal one ear so I could hear what my hunting partners were saying. Several times during the hunt I found myself searching my pockets for my ear plugs only to find them in my ears. That is how comfortable they are. They are re-useable as long as you keep them clean. I went through three pairs because I got dirt on them from my jacket pocket. They come in a little plastic box that you can replace them in when you remove them from your ears.

These are very comfortable for wear but take a little longer to get situated.  They would ideally be for wear during longer duration when taking them in and out wouldn't be necessary.

This sticky sort of putty adheres around the outside of the ear canal rather than retention by filling the inside.  You roll them into a ball then press them all around your ear canal.  This way, they don't fill up and cause discomfort inside the ear canal.  They are more comfortable for long duration.

The downside is that there is no way to clean them as it's just a putty.  After a few uses the putty isn't good any more.  In this sense, they might not be the cheapest.  But the comfort outweighs the cost.",Good plugs but not cheap,True,11

I used them on a recent trip we took as the motel we stayed at was on the noisy side.  They allowed me to catch plenty of shut eye and I never heard a thing.  I don't know of a better ear plug out there.  I do have one problem with this type of earplug.  In order to block out sounds, I have to shape them to fit in my ear canal or I can still hear too well.  But sometimes I plug it too much and it makes my ears hurt like they are popping as I descend into water too far.  So I've learned to carefully place them in the canal without too much force.

B007FMAGM8,1.0,"I purchased these to qualify my patrol AR rifle (.223) at work since they will not let me qualify with my scope or 45 degree red dot. I had no intention of using them for anything but to qualify once a year (50 rounds). I figured they will work at least long enough to qualify.

My first impression after opening the package was that they were not made very well. I figured there was no way these were Magpul; they had to be knockoffs. I put them on my rifle and headed to the range.

First, I had to pull the front sight post all the way up to even get close to a zero. I had to pull it up so far, it went past the locking pin that keeps the post from turning. My rounds were still too high but close enough for me to wing it. Second, the rear sight broke half way through qualifying. It would no longer stay up on its own. After a little duct tape, I made them work for a few more rounds. I qualified, but with an embarrassing score for an Army trained sniper. I put my scope and red dot back on, then threw these things in the trash. They looked better there than on my rifle. The only reason this review has a star is because Amazon won't let me give zero.

B007FMAGM8,2.0,"So I bought these for an airsoft gun I own, and really wanted these to be cool, but you get what you pay for I guess...

They are made of a pretty decent plastic material, and have a cool ""flip up"" feature, where you press down on the back or little tab on each sight, which releases the spring so they flip up. It is pretty satisfying to do that

BUT...the plastic piece with the hole on the rear sight on mine is permanently slanted and there is nothing I can do about it...The sights also aren't that centered when you mount it to a rail so if you are shooting something long distance, you may be shooting WAY off, however it isn't as noticeable up close...

also there is NO way to adjust the elevation up and down on the rear sight, just left to right.

Overall I'm not too thrilled about these sight, even for an airsoft gun.. I WOULD NEVER use these on one of my real rifles, as they wouldn't be accurate at all.",Not that great to be honest...,True,

These don't flip open easily. They do not sit on the rail right. The back sight is literally cracking because of the cheap plastic that it was molded from. No wonder they were so cheap. These are knock offs...",These can't be magpul,True,
B007FMAGM8,4.0,"I have a lot to say about these sites.  First, as indicated, these are ""training sites"" which translates to, only use them on 22, paint ball or air rifles. Would they work on your .223? Probably, but I would definitely buy the iron sites for said rifle system. Thus the major price difference between these and your standard Magpul iron sites!  Putting it simply the low recoil of the three I mentioned (and tried them on) will prevent these plastic sites from malfunctioning (snapping open or closed, moving on the rail et al).
  They were quite a bit tight mounting to the rails on my Ruger Archangel 556 frame and I had to tweak them a bit to line them up properly. Others here have already done a great job touching on the limitations of the rear site, but it isn't a deal breaker, you can still get plenty of good usage out of these sites with just very slight modification.",Dont love 'em but they do what they need to,True,
B007FMAGM8,1.0,"Honestly, I didn't expect much to begin with when the cost of this set is still cheaper than either a front or rear genuine Magpul MBUS (authentic MBUS sights NEVER come as a set). With that being said, I didn't expect them to be complete garbage either. I was wrong. They don't lay down well, the rear sight aperture wiggles when flipping the sight up (forcing you to push it back in place) and I actually broke the rear sight when putting it on my .22 upper. I have the real MBUS sights on my 5.56 upper and the comparison is like water and wine. Not only is the construction of the PTS sights horrible, they look horrible too. There are a lot of burrs and excess flashing on the edges from the molding process. Despite the dolled up ""made by the PTS division of Magpul"" claims, these are just some Chinese knockoffs. I wouldn't depend on these for even my .22 upper, and I don't do air soft but I wouldn't even recommend them for that. DO NOT BUY...YOU WILL BE SENDING THEM BACK.

B007FMAGM8,2.0,"They are definitely cheap, Chinese copies of the quality American made Magpul product.

Both front and rear sights took some muscle to work onto my rail, shaving some of the plastic off in the process.

The rear sight seems a bit loose and I doubt it will actually hold zero at all.

The front sight is so tight that the lever portion that locks the sight in place (up or down) sticks to the rail and doesn't pop back up as it should. I have to file down the insides of it so that it works properly.

B007FMAGM8,4.0,"At the price paid i'm not gonna complain about these sights. I knew before buying these that I would be putting them on a low recoil .22 and that they were knockoff's, but pretty good knockoff's to be honest.  I wouldn't use them as back up sights on my AR but on my .22 I have no fear even using them as the primary sights.",Held Good Zero on my .22,True,
B007FMAGM8,3.0,"The Magpul MBUS sites are very nice set of sights. My M&P 15-22 came with the original Magpul sites. I decided to swap them over to my SIG 516 and buy this pair of PTS sites for my M&P 15-22. There is a noticeable difference in quality from the original Magpul sites and this pair of PTS sites as you would expect considering they are about half the price. The plastic seems to be a harder and more brittle type of plastic on the PTS sites. As you may Artie know the original Magpul sites are made with DuPont polymer.
One of the things about the PTS sites is there is no graduated indicator for windage adjustment on the back of the site like you would see on the original Magpul ones. Also on the rear flip up sight there are two diameters of peephole to look through. On mine when you flip up the rear sight the narrow diameter peephole always flips down with the momentum and doesn't stay where it should. I will have to figure some way to tighten things up so it doesn't flip down every time.
Another issue I had was that the rear flip up sight did not want to flip up when you push the button. I had to take a knife and scrape off some of the plastic in order to get it to flip up with the push of the button.
If anyone out there is wondering if they should by this instead of the original Magpul sites just to save a buck there's definitely a difference in the quality. Do not think that you are getting the exact same sight for a cheaper price because they are quite different in quality. There are some very minor differences in the molding of the plastic as well as the labeling on the sights. For example, you can tell the original Magpul sites from the PTS sights because the PTS sites have a Allan key screw and the original Magpul sites use a flathead screw. So if you know what to look for you can tell when somebody's using the PTS sights or the original Magpul USA ones.
I started to give this product a four star rating but I just couldn't bring myself to leave it that way. The original Magpul USA sights deserve five but I would really give this one about 3 1/2 if that were possible.
In summary, if you're looking for really high quality and durable sites that can withstand a beating fork out the extra money for the original Magpul USA sites. But if you want to save some money and maybe you're putting this on airsoft or like me on just a little 22 that won't see a whole lot of beating this is a good way to save some money. Keep in mind, though, you might need to tinker with these a little bit to get them to work properly.",Half the price and half the quality of the original Magpul MBUS,True,2.0

B00806CFOK,5.0,"I used calipers quite a bit before switching to this, but man I'm glad I did.

Style: If you are a hunter, or just prefer the camo look, you will like these. The camo and the material look really nice, and feel good on your wrist.

Usage: One thing that I didn't like about calipers was that you had to click to trigger to open them, and then click again to close them. If you plan on shooting 50-100 shots in a sitting, that is a long time just messing with that. With the hook, you just grab the draw string and pull. It feels fluid and natural.

Options: The level of customization is incredible. Being able to adjust everything from the length of the hook arm, to the pressure sensitivity of the trigger, to the length of the trigger pull allows you to make the release perfect for YOU!

My only tiny complaint is that if you have smaller wrists, then there is a lot of slack on the strap. It looks a little goofy, but it doesn't actually affect the function of the hook, but I figured it is worth pointing out.

B008X3BNM0,4.0,"Purchased this lacrosse goal for my son so he could set it up in the backyard, but just as easily take it to a friend's house or to the park.  This goal is surprisingly lightweight yet extremely sturdy.  Even after whipping hundreds of VERY HARD shots at this net, the frame barely budged (and I didn't even have it staked to the ground).  Set-up time is about 10 min max, and take-down is even quicker.  The netting seems quite sturdy, and feels like it should last quite several years (time will tell I guess).  All of the poles, clips, ties, stakes, etc. are well fitted making assembly quick and true.

One word of caution though...  Since the front of the net is held up by tension from the ""whip"" style tent poles, rather than rigid steel piping (like on a real lacrosse goal), it makes it difficult to attach a shooting target.  There's really nothing solid for the target to attach to.  This isn't a really a flaw with this product, just more of a design restriction players should be aware of.

That net is a regulation heavy steel net, with a 'hector the rejector'.  We've had it for a few years and it gets left outside all year, so the strings and the 'hector' are deteriorating.  I thought this net would be a great replacement because it can be taken in during the winter.

Well yes, and no.  This is a regulation sized net, and it is pretty sturdy, but in trying to be both sturdy and portable, it is neither as sturdy as a regulation net nor as portable as claimed.  It IS portable, but it takes a good 5-10 minutes to set up, and the same to take down, and it's VERY hard for one person to take it down alone.

THE GOOD:
+ Regulation sized net
+ Sturdy enough for practice
+ Reasonably portable - you're not going to want to take it down every day, but you *can"" take it with you on vacation etc, which is excellent.

THE BAD:
- Cumbersome and irritating to put up and take down, especially alone, even after a dozen times
- Not as sturdy as a 'real' net... more for casual practice shots than hard shooting or 2 person playing(at least at a high-school level, probably just fine for younger kids)

The neighbor kids saw her out playing with this and they came over to try it out too. It's nice that there is a carry case to put it all back into if you want to disassemble it and take it elsewhere.

B008X3BNM0,4.0,"The assembly of this 6' X 6' net is straightforward, particularly after you've assembled it and disassembled it once.  When you break down the goal, it's easy to get back in its portable pouch, which is about the size of a very slim golf bag (i.e. one you would only carry three clubs in).  Putting the net in last seems to work best, otherwise it's difficult to get the metal rods all the way in.

While the net can't take repeated Gait-brothers'-type lacrosse-stick slams, it is good for goal-defense practice and for shooting on goal.  The net comes with four metal hooks to secure it on the ground.  While these work well, I did notice that one of the tension-tite arm poles (the springy poles on the back of the goal), was bending differently than the other one.  This, it turned out, was due to the goal's being placed on slightly uneven ground, so be careful when anchoring everything down with the hooks.

The biggest issue I see with the goal is that the net is secured with Velcro strips along the base.  Over time, the Velcro will lose its effectiveness and will have to be replaced.  While this isn't a big deal now and Velcro is readily available in the marketplace, I thought it worth mentioning.

CONS:
Heavy--weighs in at 20.2 lbs

The SKLZ Quickster Lacrosse Goal is an easy-to-set up lacrosse net.  SKLZ is an excellent company that puts out creative, high-quality equipment.  As with all of the SKLZ gear that I have used, this net is well constructed and easy to set up.

There are simple instructions for putting the net together, but it is basically straightforward.  I have one of SKLZ's practice soccer goal and the set up with the netting and tension arms is nearly identical. Once you get the hang of it you can build it or take it down within minutes.  At 6'x6' the net is regulation size.  (As it is not fully constructed of tubular steel, however, it cannot be considered an NCAA regulation net.)

The net is constructed of high-quality materials and bore the brunt of any torture that my 17-year-old and his friends could muster with a lacrosse ball. When they say that the net can withstand a 100 mph ball, I was at first skeptical but I now believe it. The net took a lot of punishing and never tipped over, even when the ball hit the posts.  The four stakes, when placed correctly, really do keep the net stable.  My son was highly impressed (and it's not easy to impress a 17-year-old lacrosse player).  When you're done, the whole thing deconstructs and fits into a long sac with a shoulder strap for carting around.

If there's one disadvantage to this net, it is that it is hefty.  Amazon puts the weight at 20.2 pounds and that's a lot of weight to carry around.  This is not something that you're going to want to casually move from place to place but something you might throw in the car if you are going to the park for a family outing and your kids want to practice some lacrosse.

All in all, a great lacrosse practice net.  Recommended.","Easy to set up, practice lacrosse net--somewhat heavy",False,
B008X3BNM0,4.0,"This thing is pretty heavy, so ""portable"" is in the arms of the (be)holder. But that also means it's well-made, and has stopped plenty of soccer and other balls we've tossed into it. Some of them were being chased by our dog, who got tangled in it but the netting didn't break, so a plus there. The only negatives are that it does take a little while to set up, but not too bad, and the corners feel a little bit flimsier than they could be. I note in other reviews here that some have broken, so I guess we'll just have to be extra careful when resetting it up elsewhere. Other than that, a good solid net with strong framing, though it could come in under the 100 price point to offer more value.

All in all, worth it if you need the extra strength to catch fast balls like lacrosse or maybe jai-alai if you live in Miami, and prefer to keep it in one place, or don't mind a mildly heavy lug session. Just be careful of the corners.",Solid,False,
B008X3BNM0,5.0,"I have several portable goal/net items.  This is my second from SLKZ, the other being a portable soccer goal.  Understandably, the soccer goal is much smaller than regulation size (8' x 5' as opposed to 24' x 8').  This product is a regulation size lacrosse goal (6' x 6').

What's in the box?  Well for starters, after you open the box you find that everything is in a a nice black carrying bag, of decent thickness and with a should strap.  The bag includes:
* Lacrosse net
* Jointed frame
* Ground anchors (4)
* Instruction guide

If you have set up something before (other portable sports goals, tents, etc.) which use jointed frame components, you will probably be able to figure the set up out with minimal, or no, referring to the directions.  Even if you've never done this before, you probably are looking at 15 minutes or so, and that only the first time out.  Once you've done it once, it's a 5 - 10 minute job, at most.

Once set up, there is a decent amount of tension on the frame, so you want to set it up properly, and more importantly, be careful when you disassemble it.  Release the tension on the rods carefully.  Not that they are overly dangerous, but they have tension so you just need to be reasonably cautious.

Although this is regulation 6' x 6', it really should be used for practice, possible a light scrimmage, which I think is how it is advertised.  I can't imagine an official would allow you to use a net with tension rods in it for a real game any way.

The frame is steel, painted orange (of course!), and the tension rods are fiberglass.  The net is 2-play, white and durable.  Everything is well made.

As far as performance, this goal is very secure once the ground stakes are in, and it handles the ball very well.  My college age son has a fairly hard shot, and the net held the ball fine every time.

I like everything about this product.  The only thing that is a pain at all is putting the product back in the carrying case.  Like most products that have a carrying case, they never seem to go in quite as easy as they come out.  I advise rolling/wrapping the net up as tight as you can, which helps it fit more easily into the case with the frame.  You can get it back in the case though, it is just a tight fit.  The case sort of wraps shut and secures with velcro.",Here's The Scoop!,False,

It appears to be well constructed. Not flimsy pieces of ultra thin metal. I was assembling it indoors, which proved a challenge because I couldn't use the ground stakes to hold the bottom down while I attached the upper portion of net. The bars that hold the upper part and straight when you attach the upper portion. Then you have to use a bit of force to bend them while you attach the bottom portion to the legs. Not horrendously difficult, but you will need to assert yourself against the net.

Overall, I'm pretty pleased that it took less than 20 minutes to assemble the entire thing and my kids were able to start playing with it.  Once the top and bottom pegs are attached, you just wrap the velcro straps around the poles in about a dozen places. Once the weather warms up it will be moving outdoors, but after having it here for more than a week, my little girls couldn't bear to see it standing in the corner any longer and I caved.

B008YA107U,5.0,"I bought the white ones after I had found some in black at a store near me that are 2% spandex. Originally had intended these for alpine skiing but I am back to no socks at all for that. Both of these are very comfortable and IMO are calf socks not crew. I easily pull them over my [big] calfs and do not stress the toe/foot area at all. The toes have extra material to absorb and transfer moisture along with the back of the heal for comfort. Everywhere else it is ultra thin to a mesh over the instep. The pattern under the arch is thicker in the colored areas. I rarely have an issue with bunching of the sock under the foot. The overall stitching design allows the foot area to comfortably wrap the foot without excess tension or slipping while firmly being held on the leg and stays put on my calf even under extreme maneuvers skating. I will be buying more. Funny this was the only model ultrathin that the Oregon Outlet store did not have in stock [only ankle ones which I gave some to a jib skater I know] when I visited in May, and they had every other crew sock they make in stock it seemed. I have used these now for 4 months and the 2% ones are starting to show some wear in the spandex but still perform well. I have used these at least once a week every week since I got them so minimum of 32 hours per pair over 4 months on the rink. Sometimes I find myself wearing them hours after I skate.

Two dives into the trip she was saying she didn't like the display and preferred her old computer, and I was hoping that more familiarity would take care of the problem. The second day we started with a 100ft dive and that is probably when the Zoop had a fatal mishap. It was dead when we hit the water for the second dive.

B009F1924K,4.0,"A few observations after using it for a few dives:

1. 3 minute safety stop.  If you want a longer safety stop, you'll just have to do it manually since there is no option to increase to 5min.

2. Safety stop count down only shows minutes, not seconds.  Maybe it's just me, but showing the number of minutes AND seconds remaining would be nice.  Gives you something a little more interesting to look at I guess when you're waiting at 15'.

3. Download to the computer works with the appropriate USB cable just fine, but isn't intuitive to work.  I'm just used to my iPhone automatically syncing I guess, but the Zoop you have to go into the menus and tell it to connect to the computer.

4. Buttons are a little harder to press then I'd like, but it's not like you have to be He-Man to make it work.

5. Generally speaking it is pretty easy to use and the display has a lot of information on it.  But you will need to most likely use the manual to set it up before you use it and refer to it the first few times.  There are some things that seem harder to bring up in the display (like your dive history) then it probably should be.

Not for serious divers.",Follow up to the Gekko model failure!,False,4.0
B009F1924K,5.0,"Here are the features I found important in choosing the Zoop:

1.  Big, easy-to-read display.
2.  Ease of use.
3.  Nitrox ability.
4.  Audible alarms (user-adjustable as to whether they sound).
5.  Altitude setting.
6.  Personal adjustment (to make the computer more conservative).
7.  Ability to record the dive data manually
8.  User-replaceable battery.

Here are features that I did not consider important, and the Zoop, being a basic computer, does not have them:

1.  Air integration.
2.  Tri-mix or ability to switch gases during a dive.
3.  Compass.
4.  Fresh-water setting.

In terms of easy-to-read display, the Zoop gets an A. To give you an idea of the size of the display, the outside diameter of the bezel is 60 mm, or about 2-3/8"". The display itself is around 40 mm, or about 1-3/4"". Although the computer will show the current time, it is too big to wear as an every-day wrist watch (and the display turns off after five minutes of inactivity).

The display does not have a back-light, but I don't miss that feature. In all the day-time diving that I did, the display was always really easy to read. True it was in the Bahamas, where the water is very clear, but at 134 feet, there was no problem whatsoever reading the display. On the one night dive that I did, I had a light, and I could read the display with the aid of the light. If you were into night diving, the lack of back-light might be a deal-killer.

In terms of ease-of-use, the Zoop gets a B+. The default display shows the current depth and maximum depth, the elapsed time of the dive (""DIVE TIME"") and the no-decompression-stop time remaining (""NO DEC TIME""), and the current temperature. If the dive becomes a decompression dive, the time needed to ascend, including stops, is shown (as ""ASC TIME"") in lieu of the no-decompression-stop time remaining. It also automatically goes into a count-down for the three-minute safety stop when you ascend to 20 feet. At the surface, the surface interval and no-fly time are shown by pressing the TIME button. All of this is pretty straightforward and thus intuitive.

But the Zoop doesn't get an A on ease of use because some of the other information is not so intuitive and can only be understood after studying the manual. This is a problem with all dive computers, I suspect (unless they have a scrolling plain-language display--and there may be none that do because of the limited space on the display).

I don't understand one reviewer's comment that he couldn't distinguish the no-fly symbol from the no-dive symbol. So far as I can tell, there is no such no-dive symbol, and I don't know what might be confused with the no-fly symbol (an airplane with the word ""no"" above it). In any event, I have corrective lenses in my mask, and none of the symbols was hard to read (even if some of them are cryptic in the absence of careful study of the manual).

The manual could have been written better, but it is adequate. In some cases the manual is understandable by a novice dive-computer user (or perhaps to anyone new to this device) only after doing some dives and getting some data on the computer and also getting some experience using the computer in different situations. After a while, through trial and error and reference to the manual, the menus become second nature. A few of the warnings, however, require some memorization.

There is no printed manual, and I found it a big help to print out the .pdf of the manual with two pages to each sheet of 8-1/2"" x 11"" paper and to print on both the front and the back of each sheet so the pages fit compactly in a binder. It's important to be able to flip back and forth because the illustrations are often on different pages than the associated text.

There is an online class that teaches the Zoop, and my device came with a coupon that gave me online access for one year. Even if there no coupon is offered, the course only costs $4.99. Here is a link:

[...]

The alarms feature gets a B. The only user-adjustable alarms that sound are the ones set for maximum depth and maximum time. There is also an audible alarm for exceeding the ascent rate or exceeding the ceilings for a mandatory safety stop or for a decompression stop ceiling. The audible alarms are adequate in terms of loudness--but just barely. That may be less of a problem as I get more accustomed to the sound of the alarm and thus perceive it more readily. There is also a visual ascent rate indicator, and the audible alarms are accompanied by visual indications (either blinking or a word or symbols) on the display.

The user can set the computer to display imperial or metric units (feet or meters, F or C).

In terms of battery life, I purchased the computer a little over a year ago, and it still shows four bars (the maximum) for the battery.

Yeah, the cable is expensive, but one argument in the company's favor is that the cable includes the cost of the software, which can be freely copied whether the company allows it or not. Since I don't do enough diving to need a computer program to log my dives, I found manually writing down the essential information and entering it into a spreadsheet to be sufficient for my purposes. The only information that would be tedious to record would be the profile of the dive, the depth of which is shown in the logbook mode every 30 seconds.

The band is so long that it curls around the wrist until it covers the display. I had to keep pushing it away to read the display until I trimmed it (easy to do). But because I don't know how thick a covering might one day be on my wrist, I only cut the portion that overlapped the display, leaving a band that still left plenty of room to cover a thicker exposure suit.

The Zoop is reputed to have a conservative algorithm, and on one dive, I went into deco mode, though no one else did. According to the divemaster, the Zoop doesn't like the 45-minute time surface interval that was used for our dives, preferring instead a one-hour surface interval. Since all any dive computer does is to predict whether (and for how long) you have to decompress to avoid getting decompression illness (aka ""the bends""), diving within the limits established by the computer does not prevent you from getting an ""undeserved"" DCI hit, though that would appear to be rare. I wanted a conservative computer so I have no complaint about the conservative nature of the Zoop.

The other main contenders in this price bracket are the Mares Puck and the Leonardo Cressi. I haven't used either, but I suspect you can't go wrong with any of these computers. Just look for the features that you know you want (and find out through your research about the features that other people wish that the computer had) before making a choice. For example, some complain that the Cressi does not automatically count down for the three-minute safety stop. Whether that is correct or not (could be user error), that would be a deal-killer for me. But others who only dive in groups with a divemaster who directs the safety stop or who wear a watch with the computer might not care.

Having used the Zoop for 17 dives in the Bahamas and having studied the manual, I am satisfied with it, and I consider it an excellent device for the price. For $250, it gets five stars.",An excellent device for the price,False,138.0

This computer is not good for night diving.  There is no backlight and the display glow fades quickly.

(Don't get grossed out by my milk crate. It's grey so it matches my bike AND it works great hauling my groceries which is sometimes 6-2 Lts of diet soda!) Anyway- the gadget is perfect and maybe you have the right wrench with which to tighten the nut. I was using needle nose pliers.
LATER:  I got lazy and used blk zip ties to connect the gadget to the crate. It's sturdy and the zip ties match and it saved me a trip to home depot. I'm really happy with the light being higher up.

I guess there isn't a set industry standard when it comes to this. Also, it only comes with 2 mounting bolts, and clearly has 3 holes for 3 bolts. Why not include a set of 3 so that all three can be used if needed? Seems incomplete otherwise. It will work for the purpose of holding my HS 100, but it lacks in it's mounting design when mounting it to a rack itself. At least in my case. It may work flawless with another rack.

I since then purchased the Topeak MTX Trunk Bag, which doesn't quite fit with this rack mount in place, so I had to modify it slightly (i.e. cut a small piece off it). That said, if it weren't for the new bag, this device would do a very good job.

If you're handy enough to know that you need a special mount for your rear lamp, then you're probably handy enough to install it okay. My CygoLite Hotshot 50 (which is a FANTASTIC light, by the way) is now capable of being securely mounted, yet very easily removed to prevent any ""tea leaves"" from stealing it. Thus, I can feel a little bit safer on the roads.

I don't begrudge paying the price I did for it. Now, if only CygoLite could make the release tab 2 mm (1/10"") shorter, it would be prefect. In similar circumstances I would definitely buy this again.",A handy way to attach your CygoLite HotShot rear lamp,True,

B009VUB0Q8,4.0,"Ok, so I'm updating my review as my last one was more negative than it should have been. Originally, i was frustrated with the insanely tight locknuts that I mistakenly thought required two tools to tighten - one to hold the head of the screw and another to turn the nut. In actuality, only one tool is needed. This is because the head of the screw sits into the hexagonal depression on the face of the mount. So to install, it only requires that you place your thumb over the screw head to keep it in the hexagonal depression while turning the locknut.

Turning the locknuts are still kind of a pain while the rack is on, as it requires maneuvering either a wrench or hex nut driver underneath the rack. I did happen to have a wrench that was just small enough, but it still required adjusting with every turn. I installed this mount on a touring bike, so I would have liked to see a system that would have been easier to manipulate on the road. I will say, however, that once you have the locknuts sufficiently tightened, it feels pretty bomb proof. I can't imagine needing to worry about this thing for many years.","Decent enough mount, but included hardware makes installation difficult",True,

B009VUB0Q8,2.0,The lock nuts are far stronger than the plastic housing that encapsulates the nut and keeps it from spinning as you tighten = it strips out.  You're then stuck with a half tightened bolt you can tighten no further = loose mount.  Poor design,Poor design,True,

B009VUB0Q8,4.0,"While I don't like to rate reviews on shipping I must say that this item came 2 days before the expected time. Excellent. Now, the mount itself is great. If using on a Topeak Explorer rack you will come across some difficulties if you don't heed my warning. Here is how to install:
1. Use a ratchet screwdriver with a 5/16 nut.
2. Make sure that the hex portion of the screw is facing in the same direction of the light (don't place the nut under your Topeak rack).
3. Use a 5/16 bit
4.. Scrunch your hands and finger tips small enough to get under your Topeak rack and begin to turn.

This is made out of a decent amount of plastic. Nothing extremely durable. If I was riding a mountain bike I'd probably have to buy a few more spares considering the bumps a MB takes. For my hybrid I think I should be fine, even though there are those occasional pesky pot holes. My main concern with the plastic is the outer side of the nut. As you begin to tighten the bolt from underneath your rack the outside plastic will being to wrap and strip. Just be sure to not tighten too tight.

I use this with the amazing Hotshot SL 50 Cygolite rear back light. I love this combination. I've been riding for 5+ years and I'm not sure why I haven't purchased this combo sooner. I highly recommend this mount.

Beside this, I was able to immediately register the item as instructed on the booklet that it came with. I have since downloaded the app and have also used the training videos on the website.

B00AAI2AIC,2.0,"If I could rate this jacket for function and design separately, I would give the function five stars and the design zero stars.  This is a very nice, quality jacket.  But the design dimensions are absurd.  That's putting it mildly.  A reviewer on Columbia's web site was 6'3"" and bought a medium.  So I called Columbia customer service and asked about the sizing and was told to order a large.  I don't know if there was a Thermarator I but the II sizing is ridiculous.  I'm 6'2"", 190lbs+, 33"" waist with a 35"" sleeve.  The large was so big that the sleeve lengthy was to the tip of my fingers.  Probably at least a 38"" sleeve.  Only chimpanzees and NBA athletes 6'6"" and above have 38"" sleeves.  And the jacket, which is really just a fleece layer, was so big I could fit another Columbia jacket underneath it.  I looked like Humpty Dumpty.  Luckily Amazon customer service was great.

The medium still has long sleeves.  Probably 36"".  And the sleeves are pretty large in circumference in the forearms so it has sort of a bizarre look unless you have Steve Garvey forearms.  Yet, the midsection of the jacket is so tight when I zip it up that there is no way I could get anything underneath it except a thin shirt.  A sweater?  Forget it.  Wildly bizarre.  With a t-shirt or thin layer under it, the medium is generally flattering if you have an athletic build.  I'm keeping it because I had a coupon and got a great deal.

From my experience Columbia's sizing is all over the map.  That is a major quality issue.  So, even if the fabric and workmanship are good, the quality process surrounding sizing and fit is sorely lacking.  Not just in this product either.",A very bizarre design,False,8
B00AAI2AIC,4.0,"I definitely like the look and fit of this jacket. I'm an athletic build 5'11"" 175, 40 shoulder, 32 waist, and a medium was perfect for me. I know the sizing is always the hard part. Now, I read some reviews about people saying this was great for snow storms, winter blizzards, etc. No way. I'd give this a comfort rating of about 45-60 degrees. Maybe as low as 30 if your insulated well, but I'm from Chicago. No way this would cut it in that weather. Oh,and yes, the inside is shiny because it has Columbia's ""Omniheat."" You really can't tell when it's zipped up even half way.",Nice fall/spring jacket.,True,
B00AAI2AIC,4.0,"I've decided to update my review. While I still think that this jacket isn't great in windy conditions, it's actually pretty warm on cold windless days. I've been wearing it to walk my dog, and with a base layer can stay comfortable in temps between 25 and 30 degrees Fahrenheit for over an hour or more. So that's pretty good considering how light the fabric is. In my original review I hadn't worn the jacket while doing any type of physical activity. So in the wind or just being outside in the cold, the jacket isn't that warm. However, if you're doing a physical activity and can get your body heat up a little bit then the jacket will retain body heat at a comfortable level.

Original review: I was very excited to order this jacket, but unfortunately I feel disappointed now that I have it. Unlike many of the other reviewers I really like the color and I feel as though the jacket material feels nice. A lot of reviews mention the metallic liner, which is very disco, I was however looking forward to having the liner because of all of the great things that I have heard about Omni-heat. I have had the jacket for a few weeks now and have worn it in a variety of settings, with that in mind I will tell everyone to not waste their money. Not only is the jacket not warm but it is in fact less effective than a long sleeve t-shirt. The knitted exterior of he coat does absolutely nothing to trap heat and the Omni-heat liner is useless at best (at it's worst it is still very metallic and easily seen, people point it out and laugh all the time.) This jacket is less warm than any regular fleece that can be purchased for less than half of the price. Using this jacket as a template I would say that Omni-heat is little more than a gimmick, one that I unfortunately fell for. I would give the jacket a one star review, but I do like the way that it looks. Overall, I would say that his jacket would only be useful on days where the temperature is over fifty degrees and there is no wind, but then on a day like that you probably wouldn't need a jacket anyway.",Not warm (when windy),True,

UPDATE: Several people were asking what I thought about Fitbit Flex. I got one and compared it to the Jawbone UP here:  http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CVXEEYIAIR0W/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm

A couple weeks ago I received my Fitbit One Wireless Activity Plus Sleep Tracker, Black after a few months pre-order wait. I had it two full weeks, got to know and learn it, and lost it swiftly. The fact that I lost it so easily made me decide to try Jawbone Up-- thinking that if I lose my arm, I've got larger issues... My review will be a comparison of these two devices for those trying to decide between the two. Early spoiler: I recommend Jawbone Up over the Fitbit One for most people. I'll tell you why...

UPDATE: There is an Android app now for the Jawbone UP. At the original time of my review it had not been released. Please check their website for which models have been fully tested/supported.

Hardware itself

The biggest frustration I had with the Fitbit One was that I wanted to use it for daytime activity monitoring and for sleep monitoring. Using it for both activities included moving the device from my belt clip, taking it out of the rubber clip, putting it in the wrist strap, and reversing this process each day. It felt like a chore after a few days, and some mornings I even forgot to put it back on my belt after showering & changing. These issues aren't faced with the Jawbone Up because you can leave it on your wrist at all times-- even in the shower. No annoying loss, no annoying moving it from clip to pouch to clip, no forgetting it at home in the morning. The Fitbit met it's ultimate demise after only its second fall off of my belt. It's so light and in rubber, it didn't even make a sound when it left me and met the ground. It was never found. Long live my FitBit One on however many belts it ends up on before it's lost again terminally...

Battery Life & Charging

Battery life on the Fitbit One can be as much as 14 days. The Jawbone Up is rated for 10. Both devices include a USB dongle for charging, and charge in about the same amount of time. Both charged fine when I used my iPhone charger to USB for their dongle.

Syncing

The Fitbit One bluetooth sync's wirelessly to an iPhone if you want, or to a PC. The fitbit comes with a charging dongle, a bluetooth adapter-- which must be used as it won't work with most or all other bluetooth adapters already built in to a PC. Plan to use up one or two USB slots for the Fitbit One. It's not a constant sync-- you have to initiate the sync if you want it to sync ""now"". Update/clarification: It does sync automatically on bluetooth if you use it with your phone, but not constantly. You can force a sync any time you want.

The Jawbone Up syncs by removing the cap and plugging in to the headphone jack of the iPhone. At first this felt like it may be a step back from the Fitbit One, but ultimately it's simpler and I waste less battery having bluetooth activated on the phone all the time. It's simple, works reliably, and you can sync to multiple devices if you want.

Wearing

The FitBit One is quite small and the rubber belt clip is smooth and small. Many users simply drop the device in the pocket, but I'm not one to let that happen and risk loss-- ironic because I lost it via the belt clip. I also have some belts that it would't clip on, so I found myself doing creative things like clipping it inside my change pocket.

The Jawbone Up is basically a bracelet-- and a stylish looking one at that. I found that the fitment guide on the back of the box ran a little large, so I originally bought a medium. After wearing, it felt too tight. I returned it for a large. I have so far been very happy with the large size. I recommend using the print out PDF from the Jawbone site as it clearly marked me as large when the plastic guide on the box made me think medium. They recommend going ""up"" a size.

From a daytime perspective, the wrist band of the Up hasn't bothered me at all, and actually I see it and it reminds me to move! I never saw the Fitbit One, and thus thought about it less often and had fewer reminders. More about reminders in functions/software!

I do wear the Jawbone Up in the shower, and have had no issues with that so far. It feels sturdy without feeling stiff. You can manipulate it by squeezing to fit tighter, looser, reverse which side meets which, etc. It isn't a ""bendy straw"" style where it holds shape. It always holds the wrist shape. The rubber on rubber is what lets it grip more or less. It doesn't feel heavy or annoying.

Software

Aside from the functionality of wrist vs belt clip, the software is really what differentiates the Jawbone Up from the Fitbit One for me. The Jawbone Up software is infinitely more useful, visually appealing and informative for me than the Fitbit One software. The Jawbone software tracks your performance over time and so does the Fitbit One-- but the Jawbone analyzes your data and makes observations-- ""Hey you had 2x your normal amount of deep sleep last night-- did you do something different?"" and other observations like that. You can also compare your sleeping data to your day's activities. The ability to view, review, and drill down/compare your data is easier/simpler/more automated and more enjoyable on the Jawbone Up than on the Fitbit One.

Fitbit supports some more social features-- like sharing to Facebook. Both support having friends in the system who also have the device that you can view/cheer on, etc.

As far as food logging goes, I'm not a huge user of this feature yet. What I do know is that the Jawbone Up supports scanning barcodes on food to capture what it is and content. The interface to browse and add food is far more visually appealing in the Jawbone Up than in the FitBit software.

About sleep monitoring: I don't know if it's accuracy or philosophy, but from a span perspective both units were accurate. I actively tell them when I am about to drift off and when I'm done sleeping. From there, the data varies. The Fitbit One would say that I woke up some 20 - 40 times per night! Maybe each time I roll over it thinks that qualifies as awake, I don't know. The Jawbone Up rates that much less, but also gives me info on ""deep sleep vs light sleep and awake times"" which I find more useful than just knowing how many times I was awake. I've found this analysis interesting because some nights I'll feel like I slept all night, but don't feel rested in the morning, and the Up will conclude that I didn't have much deep sleep at that night. That allows me to look back at my day before and contemplate why: too much caffeine too late? Too little exercise? Too much food to late? etc. Helpful data to influence how you live your days.

Both of these devices sync your data to a website. I personally rarely visit either of these, and don't plan to, thus my lack of review on that regard. In the iPhone age I only go to a PC when it involves a lot of typing, for the most part.

Functions & Added Benefits -- most of my conclusions here are about the Jawbone Up.

Fitbit One: It has an altimeter. This is how it guesses how many flights of stairs you've climbed. It also counts dual propeller flights I found accidentally on a recent business trip. If your'e a person who is not interested in tracking sleep or want to spend the least, this device could help you start getting an idea of your day & night activities.

Jawbone Up:

-A ""power nap"" feature that utilizes data from your normal light sleep cycle at night to determine optimum number of minutes for a power nap under 30 minutes. You can initiate a power nap by a series of button presses on the wrist band.

-An inactivity reminder: The wrist band can vibrate you every so many minutes that you're inactive, and you can configure this in the iPhone app

-A wake up alarm, at a custom time and you can additionally have it wake you at ""an optimum time around your alarm"" depending on your sleep cycle

Both devices allow you to customize your stride or calibrate the distance walked.

I'm still only in my first week of owning the UP, and I prefer it over the Fitbit One. To me, the Jawbone Up is more of a ""holistic life data device"" due to the software and the fact that you can wear it all the time. The FitBit fits more in the fitness data device for me, because of the lack of insight the software provides on the phone and the fact that it isn't as simple and easy to wear all the time. I'm an IT guy who spends too much time in front of computers, a lot of time traveling, and generally not feeling like I am active enough. I wanted these devices to help me improve my awareness of wellness, activity and sleep results. For me, the Jawbone Up was the right answer all along.

You might know that a year ago the Jawbone Up was released and recalled within a month. There were some technical reliability issues and the company took the opportunity and almost an entire year to rework the device, refund all customers and let them keep the potentially failure-likely device. They have some impressive videos at their website about how they re-worked the device.

Both devices are good devices and neither had any critical flaws. n that, I hope this review may have helped you decide which fits your needs most. I plan to respond to any specific questions below so feel free to ask!",A comparison to Fitbit One -- The Holistic Wrist,True,"4,862"

B00AE1TWE0,4.0,"Been using this for a little while and wanted to share some observations.  Technically, compared with other fitness wearables I own, this should only get 3 stars but it gets the 4th star for one very important reason: the battery life is amazing.  My other devices have to be charged every 2 to 4 days it seems but this one is still showing 10 days in the free UP app after a full charge and 2 days of wearing it.  I keep mine in my pocket because there's only so much wrist real estate and because of this it's not good at knowing when I'm actually sleeping.  A few months ago I had the change to test out the Up3 and with it's heart rate tracker (and because I wore it on my wrist) seemed like it was better at tracking sleep.  App is decent but doesn't seem to have quite the community of Garmin or Fitbit.  NOTE: this is the original Up that syncs by taking off the silver cap on the end revealing a 3.5mm headphone jack (also how you charge it, with the charging cable) and plugging it into your devices headphone jack.  Mine wouldn't sync on 2 devices til I found that you have to have the volume at max level prior to plugging it in.  Now it syncs fine with both.  If you're looking for a durable, basic step/activity tracker with excellent battery life look no further.  If you like all that but would actually like to see your progress throughout the day without having to take it off your wrist and plugging it in I'd get the Up24 with its wireless bluetooth syncing with iPhone 4S and newer iPhones or the newer UP2 or UP3 which can sync via bluetooth with iPhones and Androids phones and devices.

B00AE1TWE0,5.0,"I love this UP by jawbone.  I have an Apple watch that tracks me and my steps and flights of stairs all day long.  I wanted something to track my sleep and naps and show deep sleep.  This is great.  I bought used so it was dirt cheap but it does so much!  It even has a smart alarm that will wake you up when you aren't in a deep sleep.  The band vibrates to wake you up, so it doesn't wake my husband.  It provides a lot of insight to my sleeping patterns, etc.

It does everything and more than what I expected.  I love the UP software and prefer it to the Apple Activity or Health apps (I use all 3 to get all the best features of all of them).  The UP software motivates me every day to eat well, step, and get to bed on time.  The UP syncs with my IPhone so the UP software has all my steps all day long even though I am not wearing the UP band.

I only have to charge the band every 10 days or more because I only wear it at night.

This old style UP has a hidden plug that you have to plug into the earphone of the IPhone.  It does not continuously sync by Bluetooth like the new ones.  This is not a problem for me using it at night.  I have no need to know the data immediately because I am sleeping.  I plug it in every morning to transfer the night/sleep data and then I switch to my Apple watch.  The UP software monitors/syncs the daytime steps continuously all day by syncing directly thru my IPhone via the Health app.

I couldn't be happier with my UP by Jawbone.  I have had it a month and it has worked flawlessly.  We will see how long it lasts?  All I know is it was worth it just for the software alone.

I highly recommend for anyone using an Apple watch to add night/sleep tracking and to have a more motivating app that uses both the Apple watch and the UP data.",This is a must have for Apple watch users!,True,

B00AE1TWE0,4.0,"I bought this because I was torn on a Jawbone or FitBit and wanted to see if I would even make use of it before I purchased a more expensive one. It is supposed to track steps and sleep. The steps it tracked well but the sleep doesn't track really. You have to put in the time you go to sleep and time you wake. Then it does a few hours as light sleep and then a few as deep sleep and repeats over and over. Very generic not really tracking like other models. I do like that it tracks steps though. It also tells you how many calories you burned. You can also add a food journal and the thing I really like about that is you can just scan the barcode on the food and add it that way instead of typing it all in. Another good thing- charge it for 24 hrs and you get about 9 days use out of it before needing to charge again. Bottom line, it's great at a $20 price point but it does have limits to its capabilities.

B00AE1TWE0,3.0,"I bought this as a replacement for the MisFit, which I had given up on after approximately 3 very frustrating months. The Up cost almost twice as much. And while I liked it well enough, it died around the 6 month mark giving me about twice the length of use I got out of the MisFit. However had it not died, I'd likely still be using it. I was leary of wireless syncs after the MisFit, but the Up was frustrating in a different way. I'm kind of shocked I never lost the end piece while trying to sync or while charging the battery. But it would usually eventually synch and it was relatively reliable in capturing my activities. My pedometer will do a lot of what Up does for a fraction of the cost, but the extra features the Up offers are addictive. I think I would sum it up by saying the Up had a lot of potential, but this version is limited. Due to the issues I had with it and the fact those I knew using FitBit seemed a lot happier than those I knew using Up I did not replace it with another Jawbone device.",And while I liked it well enough,True,

I like the up3 app better than the up24 app (better sleep graphics in particular), but I like the operation of the 24 (and the power nap) better.

B00AE1TWE0,3.0,"Let me start by saying I am late in getting this product as it is now discontinued.

I chose this product over the competitors because of its versatility and water resistant features, but also because it looked more like rope bracelet than a fitness tracker.

While it is handy that it records my steps(as long as my arm is swinging), it doesn't do much of anything else without my prompting. I can turn it to sleep mode, but the only way it tells when I'm sleeping is when I am not moving my arm. I don't move while I'm trying to go to sleep, so it constantly assumes that I fall asleep in four minutes every night.

If I want to record an activity I can track it by starting a stopwatch. I honestly haven't played with this feature enough to tell whether it is as smart with your activities as it claims. But since it's motion activated and has yet to measure heart rate, I can't imagine it's an accurate exercise indicator.

Along with not having a heart sensor, the technology is not yet small enough to wear without impeding daily activities and getting lost/caught in my sleeves or work gloves. That is one flaw with the lack of a clasp.

I really want to like this product but I am not a fan as I have to do all the work myself through the app as I manually sync the bracelet myself.

Maybe when heart sensors are added, the band is smaller, and wireless charging becomes a commonality, I will consider owning one of these. But for now, I will not be paying for this product or its bulkier successors.",Obsolete,True,

I looked at a couple other activity trackers as well, but I kept coming back to the Jawbone.  Even after looking over thousands of reviews, most of them not very good, I decided to take the risk and buy it anyways in the gray/silver.  So far I have no problems with it.  It syncs easily with my phone (without the use of Bluetooth with is a big plus for me cause it drains the battery so easily), it fits snugly around my wrist (which I don't mind, it's still very comfortable and doesn't move up and down my arm all day), and it's hardly even noticeable (I like that I had the option to buy it in a neutral color so I didn't have to worry about my outfits always matching, plus I can still wear my bracelets and jewelry and it blends perfectly with them).  I like the app as well.  The graphs and the coach and the food scoring is very helpful and very encouraging.  It syncs with MyFitnessPal and dozens of other health/fitness apps (my FitBug didn't do that), which is a plus for me as well, because I like being able look at everything in one place.

UPDATE:  I contacted the Jawbone company and they replied with several fixes for this.  I was able to reset it with the help of a technician.  They have an online support page as well which I was not aware of. I wondered why there wasn't a book on this, now I know that there is support.

B00AE1TWE0,3.0,"Received as a Christmas present 12/2014. By 04/2015 my button had stopped working, and a bubble had appeared under the rubber on the band. I heard how crappy this band preformed when exposed to water, so I took precautions and removed the band when I showered as well as trying to avoid as much water contact as possible when washing my hands. That didn't seem to make much of a difference though, as I'm pretty sure what happened was water damage related.

The twist design I like in some ways because its easy to take on and off, but it catches on things all the time which becomes very annoying. Since this model is discontinued, I feel like this review is a moot point, but I'll certainly be hesitant to get another one of Jawbone's wearable products in the future.

CONS: Circular Design catches easily, not as water resistant as they claim, button is very flawed design
PROS: Seems to track pretty accurately, the app is good, manual syncing so doesn't drain battery life",Maybe go with a Fitbit,False,
B00AE1TWE0,1.0,"I'm updating a previous review. I've gone through two ""Jawbone 24"" fitness bands since December, 2014. Their active life seems to be around 3 months. I received my first one when it was a Christmas gift (around $125.00 6 months ago) and had to replace it in March, 2015 ($110.00). Now it's June, 2015 and the replacement is dead. It won't recharge. These ""Jawbones"" aren't reliable and the company that manufactures them doesn't seem to want to honor any ""warranty"" that allegedly comes along with their product. Two Jawbone 24's I had lasted less than three months each. No replacements were offered/sent. The store where the first one was purchased eventually replaced it for free and ate the loss themselves. These products are, in my opinion ""junk"". I'm going to spend a few extra bucks and get a good fitness watch or another brand of a fitness band. These guys are off of my ""to buy from"" list. Note how the price has dropped from $149.00 to $35.00 in six months. They know their product's inferior too.",Buyer beware. Product is not reliable.,False,

Called the support line as I am still within my 1yr LIMITED warranty.  They don't have any other UP24 in stock so they are sending me the UP MOVE.  The whole reason for ordering this particular item was for the ""idle alert"" and the ""vibrate alarm"".  I have severe back problems and work a desk job.  This product kept me from sitting for too long by silently letting me know that it was time to get up and walk around.  The MOVE does not have these features so it is virtually useless to me!!!!  I am so upset that I spent so much money last year and now I get something that won't even do what I want it to do.  I get a whole $50 gift certificate to use on a future on line purchase for Jawbone but why would I want to spend additional money just to upgrade.

So far the only issues I've noticed it occasionally I have to push on the end when I connect it to my phone to synch. This is more than likely just an issue with my phone case. Battery life is great and recharging is pretty quick. Rather than let it run completely down, I've started charging it while I'm in the shower once it drops to about 30-40% which works out to every third day or so. The tracking apps are very good and it is the best alarm clock I've ever owned.",Good fitness tracker and excellent alarm.,True,
B00AE1TWE0,5.0,Great!  I was surprised to see how little sleep I was really getting.,Great!,True,
B00AE1TWE0,2.0,"First the good points.  The band is great, but the app is better.

1) The band is very comfortable and you can shower with it on.  Probably wouldn't want to swim, though.
2) The step count can be off significantly until you calibrate the band.  Once that's done it'll be close.  Never perfect, but close enough. (I evaluated it by counting off 1000 steps, then syncing the band and comparing.)
3) I found the sleep tracker to be incredibly accurate.  However, while the information provided was fascinating, I couldn't see any practical application for me personally.
4) The app integrates with other health apps and I LOVE this.  I never used the food tracker in the UP app but rather linked the info from MyFitnessPal.

Now the negative.  Suddenly without warning one day it didn't count any steps but the battery was showing 30%.  I performed a reset as per Jawbone's website. That fixed it for 6 days. Then it began flashing and vibrating until battery depleted. Reset didn't help. Call CS and they determined it device was defective. Stuff happens and I don't blame the product.

The unit is in warranty and I expect they'll send me out a replacement.  INSTEAD they tried to downgrade me to the UP MOVE rather than send another UP24 or replacing with the current model UP2.  I objected and was told I would have to wait 8 weeks or possibly longer for them to get a one in stock.  They refused to replace with the current model, which actually costs less than the UP24 did.

Instead it syncs with the USB adapter that one normally uses to charge the battery.

Since I typically only have to plug it in to charge the battery once every two weeks that was a problem.
Combined with my desire to monitor my activity in real time, for the most part, this was just not going to work.

B00AE1TWE0,3.0,"Initial review- received 4/14/15.

After extensive research into fitness trackers, I decided on this older model Jawbone Up.  I like that it's a non Bluetooth device.  Probably not a big deal, but figured if I was wearing this all the time, it would be nice to not have a signal beaming from my wrist all day long.  And syncing up using the headphone jack takes 30 seconds maybe.

I play a lot of basketball and wanted something like this to track my movement and give me some feedback about daily activity.

Within 20 minutes of a rec league ball game, my cap was lost.  I poked around online and this is apparently quite common, so much so that Jawbone offers a free one time replacement cap. They were, to their credit, quite personable and easy going on the phone about the replacement.  However, the fact that this device lost its cap, exposing the headphone jack and possibly subjecting it to damage from sweat or physical contact, does not bode well.

I like the Up app, and am looking forward to continual use to get a sense of what trends and activity pattern feedback I'll learn. But I wanted to write an immediate review echoing what others have apparently experienced: the cap easily falls off.  Hopefully the replacement will prove to me more secure.  I'd like to like this device, but I suppose time will tell whether I'll be able to confidently endorse it.",Beware Insecure Cap- Fell Off Almost Immediately,True,
B00AE1TWE0,5.0,"I bought this band for my wife who's trying to get in shape,  it's simple with its lack of wirless connectivity and display,  but it's effective in every way I need it to be.

B00AE1TWE0,4.0,"Let's face it. I bought this because it is inexpensive compared to other trackers but I have to say I am happy I did.

The UP Band doesn't have bluetooth or any other wireless connectivity for uploading your data but it doesn't take long to just plug into your phone. The battery life is amazing, I get about 10 days out of mine.

I had heard that the UP Band isn't very accurate but so far that hasn't been my experience. Typically I look at what my milage is before I go for a run and when I get back it accurately reflects how far I went. So in that regard I think it is great.

The companion app has the ability to add foods that you eat throughout the day if you are looking to lose or gain weight. Plus if you don't like the way the UP app tracks food then that's okay because you can connect with other tracker apps like myfitnesspal.

The sleep cycle tracker is great. It seems really accurate. I tend to wake up in the night and it always shows me when I woke up and for how long which seems on point. It has really helped me to form some better sleep habits. The only downside is that I sometimes forget to switch the band from active mode to sleep mode.

Overall I really like this product and for the price it can't be beat. Let's not kid ourselves, chances are we will buy a tracker, use it for awhile and then we will start to forget to input activities or wear it, or we don't want to wear it to a dinner or a meeting, so go with the smart choice, get the one that's priced right and does a great job.

B00AE1TWE0,2.0,"This product was GREAT at first, especially for the money!  It tracks steps, floors, workouts, and sleep like it says and the app is VERY easy to read and use.  the actual band is a comfortable but a little bulky all around.  I am left handed and wore it on my left arm, it would leave indents on my wrist or make it hard to write (I know I could of wore it on my right but it feels weird).

This band also is NOT the bluetooth connected band so you will have to plug it into your phone for it to read your steps.  Again not a bad thing just though I was getting the bluetooth one (should of known for $40)

Here is where I don't like it.  I have only had it for 2 months and heard all of the stories on the battery dying and not working.  Mine never did this, however, when it logged my sleep it would say I slept for 33 hours!  Even after manually logging the time it would say ""YAY 400% of your sleep goal was met"".  Again not too bad but then came the step miscounts.  I would say ""you've taken 5,500 steps"" and then when I would update it later it would delete my previous steps and only account for 1,200 or so.

This was just the cheap retail version so obviously I got what I paid for.  If you are serious about tracking your day and night movements SPEND THE MONEY.  I hav heard the UP3 or whatever the heart rate one is is the best one to get.

B00AE1TWE0,5.0,I love this tracker and the App.  It's been really useful to working out and learning about my sleep cycles.,Fantastic,True,
B00AE1TWE0,3.0,"I'm a late adopter of fitness trackers - I usually wait for tech to come down in price and for some bugs to be worked out before running off the buy anything, so once I saw the UP going for less than $40, I decided it would be a good time to buy it. I considered doing a lengthy review like I did for the TKO Fitness Tracker, but I think bullet points will work for the Jawbone UP:

The Good:
- Holds a decent charge
- App is well executed
- Relatively accurate
- Built in vibrating smart alarms
- Sleep tracking is extremely useful
- Comfortable to wear
- Water resistant
- Simple sync

The Bad:
- Proprietary charger
- Too easy to press multi-function button, I've woken up with only 2 hours of sleep data several times
- Not fully waterproof
- A LOT of people seem to be reporting poor quality control

Overall, it's not a bad fitness tracker. It's relatively accurate, has a well designed app that accompanies it, and charging it only once a week has worked great for me. On the other hand, I just can't get over the multi-function button design...it's too easy to press, particularly in your sleep. After several nights of waking up having turned off sleep mode while sleeping, it has become too unreliable for one of the main reasons I purchased it. If Amazon allowed half stars, this would be a 3.5 star review but as is, I'm posting it as three stars. Recommended as an intro into the fitness tracking world,  but the jury is out on whether I'll be continuing my use of this device.",Some unavoidable design flaws.,True,
B00AE1TWE0,2.0,"I got my Up through a Groupon, but so this in no way reflects on Amazon, or the vendors selling here. This is strictly about the product.

I purchased my Up in November. Since I'm writing this at the beginning of March, that means I have about 3.5 months of use to evaluate.

I have liked the software, for the most part. I came from an older Fitbit Ultra, so there were some differences to get used to but overall, I think I get good data from the Up. I'm not hugely concerned with have an exact count of my daily steps, as long as my data is consistant, so I've never gotten that accurate with it. It tells me each day how I've compared to other days, and that is what I need right now. I've been a little bummed that the interface is limited to my phones, but I can deal with it. One serious oversight is the inability to use it with an Android tablet. I cannot understand why the software is not available on my Nexus 7. But as I've said, I've dealt with it.

The activity is based on steps, so if I am riding my bike on my trainer indoors, it doesn't do me much good. However, being on my wrist means it's always with me, and works to track my sleep better than my Fitbit did, because I never remembered to put on that silly wristband with my Fitbit (my fault, not theirs! but it still points to the convenience of having it on my wrist.)

The apps on both the iPhone and Android are very similar, so there is no confusion going back and forth between them. Plug your Up into the headphone port while the app is open, and it syncs. Fairly painless. I do wish I had gotten wireless syncing, but that is on me for not paying attention to exactly what I was buying. Charging the Up is pretty easy, too. I actually put the charging cable in my truck's USB adapter, so I plug it in on the way to work, and have never killed the battery. Battery reports that it will last 9-10 days, which is enough for most of my journeys.

Each morning when I plug it in to sync, I get little encouraging messages, health notices, and recipes. I also get a synopsis of my activity the day before, and a challenge for the coming day. I really appreciate the challenges, as it often pushes me just a little more.

The interface has but one button. Setting workout mode, sleep mode, and everything else is done right there. I really only used the sleep tracking mode, as my workouts are often measured with other tools (remember the bike?). I did like the vibrating reminders to move, or get ready for bed, and really liked the vibrating alarm in the mornings. Very effective to wake me up without disturbing my wife.

Over all, the software and feature set is pretty good and easy to use.

The ""okay"" part of this is that I am a big guy with big wrists, and even though I bought the large, putting it on my wrist always feels like I'm going to break something. I haven't, but I always feel that way. The coloring on the rubber coating is wearing off where it sits on my wrist. Not a huge deal, but worth mentioning.

The bad is the rubber itself. I have been plagued with an exterior rubber ""housing"" that wants to stretch, grow, wander, and otherwise be a pain in the neck. It first came lose on the end with the cap and made it more and more difficult to put the cap on or to charge it. I finally used an Xacto knife to trim the rubber back until I could put the cap on, but it has been a constant battle. The last few days, I've noticed the rubber starting to grow around the button on the other end. Today, I noticed that the rubber on that end has split around the button, which I can only assume will/has compromised the water resistance of the unit. I discovered today that this problem is a common issue with these devices, seeming to happen about 3 months into ownership.

Honestly, in spite of the functionality, I would not be able to recommend this device to anyone because of the problems with the rubber. There doesn't seem to be any ""fix"" anywhere on the horizon, and there doesn't seem to be any acknowledgement from Jawbone that there is a problem.
The problem seems to have extended to the UP24, as well, so I'm not sure that is a valid answer. I'm going to keep trimming for now, and see what I can find as a replacement.",I have liked the software,False,
B00AE1TWE0,5.0,"I love how it keeps track of my sleep and activity during the day.  I try every day to reach 100% or 10,000 steps.  It also buzzes my wrist if I've been inactive for over an hour.",Great catalyst to get moving!,True,
B00AE1TWE0,4.0,"2/1
Love this bracelet.  Good fit and easy to use with the free app on my Android.  I can't believe how much more I am moving and how aware I am of my activity.

Update 3/14
At first, I loved this item.  It was fun to see my movement and sleep.  I also connected a free app to track food intake and it coordinated all of it on the Up app.  However, at the six week point it quit tracking data.  I followed the instructions for a soft reset and it began tracking again.  However, it quit holding a charge.  A full charge (usually 7 plus days) died in two hours.  This happened twice.  When I tried to charge it after the second time, it quit charging.  I contacted the company and was told I was still under warranty and they would send me out a new band as well as a pre paid slip to send in my current one.  I will revise this review after that process as long as the new one keeps working.  I do see from the other reviews that the six to eight week point seems to be the death of this device.

After one week I had not received any notification of shipment of my replacement.  I called back and they said my color (blue) was out of stock.  They weren't going to contact me, just let me wait until it was stocked again.  I told them any color was fine and the lady was very helpful and sent it to me via 2 day shipping for free.

It is working fine for now, but so did the first one.  I will update at the 8 week mark (which seems to be the death time for these).

The only downside of the product is that its very easy to lose the cap that covers the plug and that sometimes he had some trouble with syncing the band with his smartphone because it DOES need a wifi or cellular connection in order to syncing your activities, so keep in mind that.
In the positive things we can say about it is that the material quality is nice, its very easy to use it, just have to plug it and its done, no buttons (just for sleeping and snoozing), has some useful features (alarms for remind something, activity buzz, sleep tracking, etc).

B00AE1TWE0,4.0,"I purchased the UP Jawbone as an entry level band to track my fitness.  So far I like how the app works and the fact that I have evidence that I'm not as active as I think .. lol.  I only get 3K steps a day .. no wonder why I'm gaining weight!

I think wearing the band is ok, in general it's comfortable, but it gets to a point where I want to get it off (same as my watch) and I really disliked sleeping with the band ( just bugged the heck out of me all night and I couldn't wait to take it off in the AM), but I at least can see my sleep pattern.  I'll probably stay in the Fitbit family and upgrade to a more modern model when I'm over this band (or it stops working!) .. Otherwise, I'm happy with my purchase.","So far, so good ..",True,

B00AE1TWE0,1.0,"This item is garbage.  First off it is a pain to plug it in to your phone every time you want to change something or get your stats but I knew that going into it.  Second there is no display so back to having to plug it into your phone to see how your currently doing.
Lets go through the list of features.  First it is supposed to track steps but what does it really track.  It says to wear it on you non dominant hand but should you do something using the hand it is on non fitness related all of a sudden you have reached your goal.  An the other side I have been walking around the house and it vibrated to remind me to get moving.
The sleep tracker I thought was cool at first as well as the alarm that woke you up at the best time in your sleep cycle.  Well it doesn't vibrate had enough to wake me up, not even sure if that works.  You have to manually put it in and out of sleep mode.  Many times I wake up, push the button and apparently I had already woken up.  The only thing on it that seemed to work without fail was the 30 minute reminder to go to bed.
The most annoying thing at all is plugging it in after a full day of activity, or great nights sleep, it syncs and there is nothing there.

B00AE1TWE0,1.0,"I bought my Jawbone Up (black - medium) at Costco and began using it about a week ago.  I have had a whole line of fancy pedometers... Fitbit (first gen - clip on)... Misfit Shine (worked 2 mos and died - hated how it looked - but was easy to see progress on actual device without app)... and a few others along with a the old school peds. The Jawbone UP is not waterproof - which if fine with me.  I am just a regular person (kinda old and not tech savvy) and these are my simple observations and opinions.

THINGS I LIKE
*Super easy to put on...take off
*comfortable to wear... I have an ""average wrist"" and the medium fits perfectly... not to too tight or too loose. I think their reference on the size is accurate. At Costco they had a plaque... ""place your wrist here"" which was a no-brainer. It was about $59.00 - a reasonable price I think.
*I love the information it provides, the encouragements and the sleep tracking. The info it provides is by far the best compiled in my opinion.
*The jawbone Up will go for about 7 days before it needs to be charged again - seems reasonable.
*I really like the personal challenges and encouragement to succeed.

THINGS I DON'T LIKE
*Inputting the food is really cumbersome and editing is next to impossible... the ""scan"" barcode option is interesting, but it doesn't work - or at least I have never found even ONE barcode that uplinked. ... so I linked my jawbone to myfitnesspal (free food/activity log app) to help with that issue.
*The odd settings - like ""power nap"" etc.. you have to keep the little 5 page instruction booklet on how many times to push the tip etc to do a few ""extra"" things... Also, I have ""tested"" the power nap option twice and it failed both times. It did not buzz at the 26 minute mark as advertised. Minus star for that.  Would be great it had worked. (Note:  I have NOT yet tested the ""alarm"" or other features)
*No way to check progress ON the device itself - you must review on your smart phone app

I sure hope I don't have the issues that others have reported.... like it stops working after a very short time.  I actually like it the best so far, therefore I have grand hopes it will work for a reasonable time - at least a year.
I WILL BE UPDATING MY REVIEW AS I USE IT AND/OR WITH ANY ISSUES.

MARCH 9, 2015....  So... right around 2 months of use and it has completely stopped working. Will not sync, will not charge, will not reboot. A complete loss of data. A complete failure.  I did the ""troubleshooting""... emailed them, as directed, when the troubleshooting was unsuccessful.  I provided them a phone number, however, I have not received a call.  Honestly, as carefully as I cared for and used the UP, it should have lasted well beyond 2 months.  I really had begun to enjoy and rely upon it.  So I am horribly disappointed I would like to have an Up that worked for at least 2 years! 2 months is ridiculous.  Will update further if there is anything worth reporting but at this point I would not recommend purchase unless they can figure out a way to make them last more than 2 months.
MARCH 12.... I finally received an email ""conversation"" with someone from Jawbone, with instructions.  Sadly there were EXACTLY the same instructions I had already gotten AND tried from the troubleshooting section on the app.  ARGH.  So THEN that contact says they would like to call me... could they have my phone number and address and a time that would be convenient to call.  I explain I am traveling for business, in Nova Scotia right now, so the call would have to be brief (as it is my dime - costs me) and now would be a good time.  I also provided all the numbers from the inside of the band.  NOTHING.  No call.  No emails.  Nothing.  I have tried to contact them asking ""What now?""  and nothing.  Listen.... at this point I would rate the Jawbone a ZERO if that was an option and MINUS ZERO for the customer service.  If you buy one, plan on it not working for more than 2 months (read other reviews - that even might be too long) and having to pay for another one.  For me, it will NOT be a jawbone.  Too bad because I really liked the app, the band and the way it worked - until it didn't and I had to experience SUPER bad customer service on top of it.  I feel ripped off.

B00AE1TWE0,3.0,"BLUF.  Should you buy the Jawbone Up Fitness Tracker? Yes, if you're ok with having to manually synch with your phone or computer (no Bluetooth) and trying to save a few dollars.  For the price it is a great buy and Jawbone makes some of the best fitness trackers on the market.

https://help.jawbone.com/up (note: Jawbone is no longer selling the Up, but still provides support via their website)

Key features compared to the Jawbone Up24 include:
1) A longer battery life  10 Days for the Up vs. 7 days for the Up24
2) Connects to your phone via the headphone (3.5mm) jack. Up24 has a 2.5mm plug and can not connect to your phone.
3) Price.  It is cheaper than the Up24 and you can even get a like new model of the Up from Amazon Warehouse Deals for around $50.

Key feature/benefit compared to the Fitbit Flex is the phone application.  I prefer the Jawbone Up app over the Fitbit app.  My wife has the Fitbit flex and when comparing the two apps the Up had more detail and offers a lot more info, while not being too overwhelming.  The Up app simply offers a better user experience.

The key criticism of the Up is the lack of Bluetooth.  Which is why I returned this model and instead went with the Up24.  Wirelessly synching the fitness tracker makes using the device just a little simpler.  Was worth the extra money to have an Up24.

Up and Up24 aren't waterproof.  Cant wear them in the pool or in the bath.  Though you can wear it in the shower, which I prefer not to do because I find it annoying on my wrist while bathing.  I also think keeping the soap/water off of it will keep it from fading or getting a chalky appearance.  Just rinse it off with water and dry it with a towel to keep it clean.

Another criticism I have is the Jawbone customer service.  Dealt with them several times regarding issues with my Up24 and they are like talking to a robot.  Every response from them is always, did you try a soft reset.  Ugh..., if you can be patient, they will eventually help you, but they have a ways to go with regard to offering a positive experience to the customer.

As of Jan 15 the Up current has 3 out of 5 stars on Amazon reviews.  I concur with this rating, but only because it doesnt have Bluetooth and with newer models coming out, specifically referring to the Up3 by Jawbone, the Up is getting old.

Many of the Amazon criticisms address the durability and connectivity issues with the Jawbone Up.  If you treat the Up well it will last, but like any new technology, the Up can be finicky and sometimes give you problems.  One benefit of not having Bluetooth is the Ups connection to your phone is more likely to work and not face the same issues that impact wireless technology.  As for me, Ive dealt with some of the functionality problems wearing the Up24 (see my review of the Up24 for details - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LXV7WLIC5V65/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm).  But for only $50 and if price is the driving factor, I think the Jawbone Up is the best fitness tracker on the market.

Recommend anyone in the market for a fitness tracker read the reviews on DC Rainmakers website.  Absolutely the most detailed and informative fitness tech reviews anywhere on the internet.

Also recommend reviews on Amazon by RST.  Very thorough and well written.  http://www.amazon.com/review/RT0KPKVSQD0HI/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#RT0KPKVSQD0HI

CONCLUSION.  Should you by the Jawbone Up?  Yes if you want to spend the least amount of money and have a solid fitness tracker that provides accurate feedback.  If you can wait and have the money, I recommend the Jawbone Up3 coming out in Feb or Mar 15.  Or if you want more than just a fitness tracker (i.e. a fitness watch) and have the money to spend, wait until the Apple Watch comes out.  Im betting it will be a game changer for the fitness tracker/watch market.","Best fitness tracker for the money, but",True,5
B00AE1TWE0,3.0,"This version of the UP sounds great in practice, but so far (two and a half months of use) seems a little clunky.  The sleep function (and accompanying software) is not nearly as accurate as Jawbone claims.  For some reason, I seem to lose about 2/3 of the sleep data after a sync.  While it is true that the user can manually input data, if I do that four or five nights a week, why have the device?  The pedometer function seems accurate enough, and I certainly appreciate the sporadic silent reminders that I need to get up and move around.  I always worry about the design when taking the unit off, or when it snags on something due to the squared ends and rubberized coating.  Each encounter seems to be a new flirtation with premature failure.  The unit does hold up well in the face of regular showers (every Thursday whether I need one or not), and does not seem to be affected by changes in temperature.  I have not had it long enough to introduce it to Texas heat yet, but it seemed to perform well in the barren wasteland that is Minnesota.

B00AE1TWE0,1.0,"I have had this UP band for almost a year now. For the first 10 months I really, really loved it! I bought it against all the bad reviews and it worked perfectly for me....until a couple months ago. First, it stopped vibrating when it was supposed to. It didn't vibrate for the alarms I set or even the short vibrate for when I changed functions. Then it stopped keeping my steps. I would upload it after a couple days and there were always days missing - sometimes it wouldn't upload any info at all. And now it won't charge. It tells me it has charged but all I get is a red light after I unplug it and try to wear it. I can't switch it to sleep mode or any other mode.

It really sucks because for the first few months I was totally in LOVE with this item. But it only lasted about 10 months. I also want to note that I was very careful with it - never got it wet, charged it as needed every few days, downloaded it every couple days, and was never rough with it.

B00AE1TWE0,3.0,"I gave it a 3 because the only reason I bought this was because I wanted something that could wake me up soundlessly.  It does do that.  And I like the User Interface of the App. However, I've had several issues with it.

PROS:
  *Nice app, with a great UI and detailed sleep analysis.
  *Band is relatively comfortable, feels similar to a wrist watch
  *Vibrate function is, in my opinion, effective and quiet.  I'm neither a heavy nor light sleeper and it woke me from sleep instantly, but not in an overly obnoxious way.
CONS:
  *  The app allows weight entry for fitness tracking, calculating your BMI, and that is a TERRIBLE indicator of health!  It often qualifies healthy, muscular people as ""obese"" because of their muscles' weight.  Most health enthusiasts and professionals will agree that body composition (BF%) and/or body measurements would be a much more effective and accurate means of quantifying health.
  *  The band fails to sync 99% of the time when I plug it in to the phone, and it's extra irritating that I have to turn my phone's volume up for it to have a chance to work.  This doesn't effect me as much, as I'm using it primarily as a simple sleep monitor and alarm, but this would be unacceptable if I were wanting to track my activity consistently.  I would absolutely get the UP24 for that reason; it syncs automatically, via bluetooth.
*  Because the UP is designed to wake you up at an ""ideal"" time (calculated by your sleep cycles and desired hours of sleep), it apparently wakes you up according to its calculations, treating your actual designated, programmed alarm time as more of a polite, secondary request.  So, when i said I wanted to wake up at 8 am on the weekends, and 6.5 hours of sleep is my goal, and went to sleep at midnight, it woke me up at around 5:45 because of where I was in my sleep cycle, and the fact that it was daylight savings and I hadn't synced it to get the right time (not that I hadn't tried...).  Clearly the UP has no appreciation for the concept of sleeping in on the weekend...
NEUTRAL:
As a side note on sizing, my wrist is 6 inches in circumference, so I got the medium (as recommended by the manufacturer in the event that you chose the larger between sizes you may fit), and I'm fairly pleased with it.  It slides down my wrist a bit, but works fine because I just wear it next to my watch.",***I would rate this lower if I needed full functionality***,True,

B00AE1TWE0,5.0,"I waited a few months to review this item because many who purchased it said it began to malfunction after a certain amount of time.

It has been almost three months of daily wear for me and it still works perfectly. The sync lags a little if I don't update it for a few days, but that is most likely because there is so much data on the band. You're recommended to sync the band twice a day.

I'm not sure what everyone else is doing, but I make sure to not let water touch my up. This could be the reason why it is still working, but then you get testimonials on here of people who wore theirs in the shower and it still worked perfectly. I personally wanted to do all I could to ensure my investment so I pushed it up on my arm when washing my hands, removed it when showering or washing dishes. The only moisture it is regularly exposed to is my sweat while I walk on the treadmill for an hour a day. While I don't sweat excessively from my wrists, moisture does get on the band, but it has been fine so far. If you want to take an extra precaution you could get a wrist sweat band and put the up on top of that.

One note of caution-- they say to order a size up if you are in-between or right on the edge of one size. I disregarded this advice because I tried the plastic ring on at Best Buy and it seemed to fit with some space. The actual band does have some space, but because it is not 100% flexible, it gets into uncomfortable positions and is sometimes irritating. If I would have gotten the size up (which I plan on doing whenever this one dies on me) it wouldn't be as irritating.

B00AE1TWE0,3.0,"Well, I don't feel to bad since I bought mine ""refurbished"" so I didn't spend $100+ on it.

Honestly, I like it. Knowing various people who've had this or another type of fitness band, you sorta get what you pay for. It's also a matter of what you're looking for in these things. Personally, I wasn't all that sold on getting on to begin with, but now that I have it, I'm definitely interested in possibly shelling out a bit more in the future.

I like my band. It's not heavy, it stays on. Not obtrusive. Sadly due to the nature of the band it does get caught on stuff some times. I don't snag it often and when I have it hasn't fallen off, but it does happen. The only negative about the band is that since it just slips on it does slide up and down your wrist. You can't really tighten it to fit.

It seems to be more or less accurate on the steps and watching the sleep. Really, I haven't had any problems with that performance aspect of things.

The app is nice in both terms of look and intuitiveness.

At this point after a couple of months of use the only issue I've had is that the button is starting to be unresponsive. It works, but sometimes it takes a couple of tries to get whatever setting right.

Overall I'm pleased. Hopefully mine lasts longer than others. If not, it's not like I wasn't aware going in & while like my UP, I don't know that I would replace it with another one if it can't manage to survive a year.

**UPDATE**
Well, it only lasted a few months. Honestly my review above holds still. I really liked this thing, especially the app. The only negative I've had was that since it does not clasp on securely, it does fall off every now and then if the ends snag on something. Didn't happen often, but be aware of it happening at some point.

My band ultimately met it's demise though. The button basically became non responsive and ultimately that end of the band ""snapped"" inside. I'm willing to take the blame for this.

B00AE1TWE0,1.0,"How many bands does it take to get through 13 months?
At least three!

Given the software that comes with this device, I really wanted to rate it high.
But after two hardware failures with only a few months of service from each band, I cannot recommend this product.
Unfortunately, I have joined the long list of people who have replaced these bands numerous times. No doubt you will be thrilled with this product for the first month or two, but it will end pretty quickly.

Although the software UI is very well done, it is completely useless without a working band.
After just three months, the first band stopped working.
Just to qualify the use: I am very careful with my electronics, careful in how I put it on and removed it, never wore it in the shower (or rain for that matter). Jawbone had to replace the first band.

The second band synced up but then sat in storage for a while, while recovering from an injury. In getting ready to train for my next event, I charged up the second band. In just a couple of weeks, the battery on the second band would not hold a charge for more than 10 hours. Since the warranties of both bands = one warranty period and not two, the second band was three months out and Jawbone refused to replace it. Consider now that I have not received even close to 12 months of service from either band. The best that they could do' would be to offer a 25% off coupon to purchase band number three? :))
No thanks!

It would indeed be great if it worked. I don't consider a few months of use worth the price, not even close.
Overall, if you are a human, the ergonomics of this band are awkward at best. The software UI is great but cannot be used with a dead band. The hardware itself is a complete DUD.

When I asked why I have to get an UP24 instead of an UP, I was told that the UP had a lot of issues, but ""we appreciate you testing the device for us."" I did not realize I had to pay $129 to test their device.

""[Jawbone Support] Re: UP - No Response on Chargre
Hello ---,

Ah, I'm so sorry to hear about the trouble! That definitely sounds odd, but I'd be glad to look into the trouble for you.

I'm glad you tried out the soft reset. To make sure we don't miss any opportunity to get you up and running right away, Id like to confirm the process you used to reset the band. The soft reset procedure for UP is available here: https://jawbone.com/kb/articles/UPbatterylife.html

If the soft reset doesnt fix this issue, the hard reset should. This will erase any user data tracked by the band that has not yet been synced to the app (so please sync before going forward!), but it will also return the band to original factory settings. The steps for the hard reset are available here: www.jawbone.com/kb/articles/425.html""

[Jawbone Support] Re: UP - No response on charger
Hi ---,

Thanks for getting in touch with us about this. I'm sorry to hear that your band isn't charging properly  let's try some quick troubleshooting steps to get the band working correctly again.

First, please check the physical connection:

Try charging through a different USB port on your computer, and make sure to plug directly into the computer. (We can't guarantee how the band will charge when using a USB hub or other third party adapter.)
If you have access to a wall adapter that connects to a USB cable, try charging the band through the wall.
Make sure the band is fully plugged in, so that the base of the sync plug is fully inserted into the charger.
If adjusting the physical connection doesnt help the issue, we can try a soft reset of your band by following these steps:

Start with the UP connected to the charger, but DONT connect the charger to a power source.
PRESS + HOLD the button on your UP as you plug the charger into the USB port on a well-powered computer.
Release the button on your UP. You should see the Sun status light cycle through multiple colors, then begin to slowly pulse red, indicating that the band is charging normally.
Allow the band to charge for approximately 80 minutes, until the Sun status light changes to a solid light.
Remove the UP from the charger  the Sun status light should begin to flash.
Launch the UP app. Allow it to fully open, then plug in your band. The sync will start automatically. If it doesnt, use the manual sync option. If you're on a iOS device, swipe to the right menu screen and touch Sync Now; if you're using an Android device, touch the sync now circle in the upper right corner of the Home screen.
If these troubleshooting steps don't fix the charging issue, please reply here with your shipping address (no P.O. boxes, please!) and phone number. Ill be happy to look into processing a warranty exchange for you. So we can get you back to living UP.

So I have to keep telling it to register, and sometimes it doesn't even stick when I do that.... Ugh!! I also don't like that when I'm doing certain strength training or aerobics, it doesn't register all the extra work I do unless I'm constantly swinging the one arm I have it on. Not all moves involve both arms, but I'm still burning calories and what not. But I do like that it tracks my sleep. It's also been a problem trying to keep my toddler from pulling on it, or accidentally snagging it on his clothes or whatever when we're playing.

I can get ready in the morning, walk to and from the shower, do my hair, etc, and on my way to work I sync it and it tells me I've already done more than 1,000 steps in that hour I got ready... I don't believe I've walked that much. I wonder if it's trying to compensate for those times when I'm moving but not swinging the one arm the tracker is on... I don't know.

This is frustrating because I don't constantly carry my phone with me at work, and can only see my progress when I'm on a break...

I owned the very first Jawbone headset (although I had many before it was released), and looked towards the UP with a glimmer of hope that it would be the pinnacle of their product line.  I was sadly mistaken.

The first edition went out about every two weeks.  Jawbone eagerly replaced it, and I spent a great deal of time talking and corresponding with their customer service.  It was a mixture of delight and aggravation.  They launched the second (and current next to the 24) edition, and I was excited that they had finally worked the bugs out, and they did...for about four months at a time.  Yet, I remained steadfast in my quest to have the device that did all it was suppose to do.

It doesn't include bike rides or other activities in the ""steps"".  (See below for my hack.)
You can't manually add steps, but you can manually add activiites (and sleep), but only minutes, not actual data.

I tried to find a way to manually add steps, using some conversions I found online, but nothing worked.  However, I have been able to ""cheat"" by wearing the band looped through my shoelaces while out riding my bike and it logs steps that way.  Since I am trying to increase overall activity, and not just steps specifically, I don't really consider it cheating.",A nerd's delight!,True,2
B00AE1TWE0,1.0,"I'm on my fourth band, awaiting replacement to get to the third. When it works, I'm generally happy, but the durability of these is pathetic. The first unit failed by no longer charging or syncing. The button on the second one stopped working about a week ago. Hopefully the third will bridge the gap until the Apple watch is released.

So another dead band.  I'm done with Jawbone.  Time to find a different activity tracker.  This time, the ""button"" broke off where it connects in.  I noticed the lights stopped working the other day, the following morning, the button didn't ""silence"" the vibration.  Today, I felt it was a little ""crunchy"" about 3/4 of an in from the end.  A moment later, the button assembly broke free.",Horrible Durability,True,2
B00AE1TWE0,2.0,"I am on my second UP band and am starting to get very frustrated, as the second one is on the fritz and looks like it will need to be returned. There is no reason for it, as I haven't gotten it wet, washed it, run over it, etc. but sometimes when it runs out of power and needs to be recharged, it just stops working (this is what happened last time, too). Frequently when synching to the iPhone it just doesn't work and you have to plug and unplug frequently and shut down and refresh the app to get it to ""register"" and upload data. When it does work I find it very, very useful for tracking my daily activity, number of steps, length and quality of sleep and calories burned. I love those functions - - WHEN it works. Just as a note: as I am a surfer, lover of hot yoga and other sports that do involve water and lots of sweat, I currently CAN'T and DON'T wear my device during those forms of exercise. That is a drag, as those portions of my activities don't get tracked. Not to mention wanting to wear it when I do wet housework, gardening or wash the car. Someone needs to develop a band that is more robust, waterproof, connects via wifi and charges on a plate/mat (rather than being plugged in).

The default should simply be distance like the Garmin or other similar sports watches 3) it would be nice if it sync'd with laptop because I have an active 67 year old mother who doesn't use a smart phone or care for one but my dad would have been happy to sync her UP jawbone for her on their laptop if it was compatible... So this is just another example of how technology has a tendency to alienate those who will always remain a little behind the times but could still use equipment if companies were flexible for older folks.

B00AE1TWE0,4.0,"I sort of liked the Jawbone UP and overlooked its limitations. I do intensive HIIT (high-intensity interval training) and it didn't really give me the full number of calories I burned. My heart rate monitor consistently reported hundreds more calories than the UP. So if you do HIIT, CrossFit or anything other than running, your results might vary.

I really liked getting reports of my sleep though and this was the primary reason I kept using the UP. It provided lots of detail and was a great reality check on my sleep patterns.

Unfortunately, after four months of use it just died without warning. I visited the Jawbone website and tried their instructions to resurrect the UP but it's gone forever. I didn't shower with it an did my best to keep it dry and never knocked it around so I can only conclude that it's cheaply made and probably won't last very long in any circumstance.

B00AE1TWE0,1.0,"I've been ""living UP"" since Aug 31, 2013.  I train for different events during the year so tracking my training and sleep is very important in order to improve my performance.  Since august, I've had three major malfunctions with my up band.  The first one was last December when it just stopped working. No lights, no charging and no tracking.  I lost all the data collected during the last day it worked.  I tried every idea tech support gave me with no luck.  They sent me a replacement band after more than two weeks (they told me they were going to ship me a new one the same day, but apparently they forgot to follow through and I had to contact them again to remind them after one week without my band).  You can imagine the frustration.

I received my band and resumed my tracking.  After less than a month (two weeks tops!) I had to contact tech support again because the band tracking was unreliable.  During sync I could see the steps taken but then they wouldn't record in my daily activity log.  Tech support told me to hard reset, soft reset, and other bogus advice that didn't solve my problem.  They never gave me a true solution to my problem so I had to accept that my up band didn't track anything properly. From mid January to april there were days where I could see that I took 20,000 steps or more during a workout but they didn't show after disconnecting the band.  Also I woke up and hung around the house for hours before I got back to bed and it tracked a full night of sleep, and things like that.  It became a fashion accessory more than anything, a very expensive rubber accessory that could have come out of a Cracker Jack box.

Finally, since last week my up band runs out of charge after 4 hours of use.  It vibrates annoyingly to remind me of the piece of trash I bought and then turns off.  It never lasted the ten (10) days advertised but 4 hours?!!  Common, it's just ridiculous.  It's just amazing the lack of durability of this product.  I would have expected it to function for at least a year before breaking.  I usually don't expect to pay $129.00 for less than four months of use.

The sleep detection and iOS/Android software seems superior to the flex. The battery life can't be beat either. They say about 10 days, they mean it.
It is a bit annoying to have to plug it in to the phone every day, but the UP24 would resolve that issue at a slight cost increase and slight decrease in battery life.
The bracelet was tight for a day or so, so much so that I thought of returning it for a large, but it loosened up and is now comfortable. The rubber tends to be grippy and snags sometimes when putting on a coat or long sleeve shirt.

Initially I thought this was a great product, until it stopped connecting with my S3 after just two months.  I work in technology and I know the difference between a software sync issue and a hardware break.  I contacted their ""customer service"" department more times than I care to admit and got what appeared to be a template response telling me they are aware of the connectivity issue, however I was explicit in my emails to them in that this was not a software issue.

With no other recourse at the time I followed their blanket instructions to reinstall the app and try syncing again.  Go figure, nothing.  The phone no longer recognizes that the device is connected and this is isolated to the device only and every other piece of hardware I plug in works just fine.  Three attempts later and NO reply.

I am not wealthy, but I am not hard up for cash and this is a point of what is right or wrong in business today.  ANY product should last more than two months unless it's shelf life is described as such.  To get stonewalled by a company who is trying to swim in a see of competitors in what will be a very competitive industry over the next few years is frustrating and for them a bad move. There are better products on the market with Fitbit and Samsung coming out with some very cool products and I gave them every opportunity to keep a person who is generally a very loyal customer.  Word of mouth is huge and even more so when someone happens to be plugged into the technology industry.

The features are really what you want and need, the app is informative and useful, and the device design is slim, discreet and stylish. Only problem, the device almost inevitably fails after 2-6 months.
I am expecting my third UP to arrive in the mail sometime in the near future.
Basically what happens is that you learn to live with the device, get used to sleeping with it on your wrist, get used to syncing it, and start to look forward to it providing you with interesting and useful date.
Most importantly, you come to rely on the Silent Alarm, Power Nap, and Inactivity Reminder.
And then it breaks and you feel naked for a few days.
And then you get a new one and the process starts all over again.

It's like some love/hate relationship with somewhat you can't stand to be with or without.
So, as I wait for my third band and prepare to enter this cycle of self-destruction yet again, I am going to recommend that you avoid the UP. You'll love it and then hate it and it will do nothing but frustrate your life.","Great when until it breaks, and it will break",True,2

B00AE1TWE0,4.0,"After reviewing the various iterations of fitness trackers (Nike Fuelband, Fitbit, etc) I settled on the Jawbone UP. It is relatively intuitive to use. After installing the UP app on your smart phone you simply plug it into the phone via the headphone jack and the app does the rest. It takes about 2 hours for it to fully charge and the battery lasts me about 10 days (with 2-3 daily syncs).

Pros:
--sleep tracking that seems fairly accurate
--motion reminder (that you can set in app for how long UP can remain motionless before reminding you to move)
--alarm feature (set in app...so if you have a variable wake schedule across the week this feature might be frustrating to have to constantly set and reset)

Cons:
--activity monitor doesn't seem to be precise (calibration is a bit of a headache but it's closer to reality following calibration)
--calorie intake requires user input into app (granted I don't expect a wristband to be smart enough to determine between eating a salad versus eating a slice of pizza, but there's plenty of free apps available that do as good of a job of calorie counting as the UP app)
--not friendly with water (UP version 1 doesn't play well with liquids. Version 2 was an attempt to correct this hydrophobia but for the longevity of the device I don't take it near water aside from hand washing).

To date 2 with battery issues and 3 flat out died without ever finding out why

Positive:
  1.when working it seems to perform fairly well (issue with this will be discussed in negatives)
  2.  Customer service was very helpful in getting warranty replacements although I thought they would give me the option to pay  difference to upgrade to the new band considering I have gone through 5 bands over the past 14 months.  They did not, but I don't fault them on this as my warranty doesn't state they would or should.

Negative:
  1. Well, obviously.  I have gone through five bands over the past 14 months.
  2.  I was involved in a survey from jawbone a while back regarding this band and commented that I didn't like how I didn't get credit for walking when carrying items, or pushing a cart or baby stroller.  I was assured that the accelerometer did in fact measure steps while performing these activities.  I was tempted to believe this information except for the fact that I would get the inactivity alarm buzzing while actually moving, but pushing a cart or carrying an item.  So maybe I was getting credit and the flaw is in the buzzer.  Whose to say.
  3.  Battery life, I know I keep reading how ten days is amazing but I have yet to get one to do that.  Number five replacement so far has been the closest squeaking in at 9 days on its first charge.  If like the others I expect quick degradation of battery life, average has been in at 7 days occasionally 8.  I also do not sync the band that frequently so I would expect it to last a little longer.
  4.  A little buggy, unsure if it the accompanying app or the band itself.  Occasionally I will plug it in and get no credit for the day of wear, but it will upload the previous day.  No sleep or anything for the current day.  Sync it later and it gives me credit from the moment following the first sync.  This happened yesterday when I synced at 11am, I arise at 530, am pretty active, (I also had double checked theprevious night to ensure my sleep setting was activated) and got no sleep or step credit for the current day, but added some steps for the previous day.

B00AE1TWE0,2.0,"I've been a FitBit user for about a year now and wanted to try something that tracked sleep so I got a couple of the newer devices including a gray large Up band by Jawbone. I really disliked the Up and packed it up and returned it within a couple hours of activating it. Here's why:

To activate the band needs to be plugged in to your phone's headset/ earbud plug (iOS and Android; no Windows support, which I didn't like). The plug is standard size and is covered by the silver long cap you see in the pics that says ""Jawbone."" I grabbed my Galaxy S3 and downloaded the app then plugged it in. It was dead out of the box, which was disappointing. (You click the silvery square on the end and it lights up a flower light (or moon if you are switching to sleep mode). After charging for a couple hours it activated. OK, so a couple hours in and I'm finally up and running.

Then I put the thing on my wrist. I chose large size, which is their biggest size, and found that while it fit the shape was awkwardly oval and stiff. So while it fit it was pinching me a bit on the sides of my wrist between the arm bones and the hand bones. It also tightened up on the bottom of my wrist where you take a pulse. So it always felt like it was inhibiting me. Especially when typing at work when I rested my arm on the desk and it was on this band. Very uncomfortable.

I figured it would wear in but after a few hours it didn't. It was still riged and still tight. There were inches of room but in the wrong places and I couldn't make it flex to fit the natural shape of a wrist.

During installation you're told you should sync twice a day so I synced. Off, pull cap, plug in, load app, press sync. Kinda a lot of work for someone used to a FitBit that synced on its own wirelessly.

Finally, a note about the gray. I thought it would be a cool almost white color but it's actually a ""old PC gray"" color. Dull, sorta off white gray. Dingy is the best word. Unflattering is what my friends said. I'd go with a colorful one. I thought I wouldn't want it to stand out but there is no missing this thing so you may as well go with a colorful one.

The app, unlike the band, was really nice and in many ways better than the FitBit app. I really liked how it gave trends and identified trends (in the setup). I also liked how you can calibrate your step size through the app.

Overall, there is no way I'd actually recommend this band over a FitBit. There isn't any part of it that is more comfortable, looks better or works better than a FitBit Zip, One or even Flex (which is also a wrist band but is more flexible). Get a FitBit instead.","Uncomfortable, Complicated Band / Great App",False,
B00AE1TWE0,3.0,"This thing has been great and terrible at the same time. I bought this in mid-July 2013, and by November of the same year I am on my third different band.

B00AE1TWE0,2.0,"I got the jawbone up rather than the fitbit or fuelband because, simply, i'd never wear either of those outdoors. I'm not a fashionista, but there are limits to my wardrobe. For example, i don't wear paisly either.

That said, this product is at best ok. The app is very polished, but not very useful. If all you need is a conservative pedometer and a generous sleep monitor, that Up'll do that for you just fine. If you're lured in by the other features, well, the Up isn't there yet. I can't speak to the fitbit or fuelband.

* The battery does seem to last about 10 days.
* Since i'm right between two sizes, i got the bigger one, and it annoys me by sliding around everywhere.
* The cap is pretty much asking to be lost. You can buy more, though: 3 for $10 or so.
* It's a good, simple aesthetic. It doesn't look cheap, and it doesn't look wannabe-blingy.
* The button on the end to change modes is easy to press - i have to make sure i wear the band with the button pointing toward my pinky finger so the button doesn't get accidentally pressed when i'm holding my toddler.
* The vibration is strong enough to wake a light sleeper, but if you're a heavy sleeper, it probably won't actually work as an alarm.
* The LEDs are easy to see.

The App
* The pedometer
** No false steps for activities like driving, which is good
** Tends to miss any step where your hands aren't moving normally, like pushing a shopping cart or holding hands with a child
* The sleep monitor
** It's just reading how still you are. I get 'sleep' credit for my early morning insomnia where i'm wide awake and staring at the ceiling hoping by some miracle this will be the day i actually fall asleep again.
** Very good at detecting 'awake' in terms of actually getting out of bed, to use the bathroom or let the dog out or other similar activities.
* 'Activities'
** The selection of activities is pretty broad, and the calorie estimates for using the eliptical line up reasonably well with my eliptical's estimates.
** There are only formal exercise options. Apparently Jawbone Up is designed for people who get all their exercise in a gym, and have other people to shovel their snow and do their yardwork. It's easy enough to find calorie burn estimates for these activities online. Heck, the app could even allow us to add 'custom' exercise options. Instead, we play games, like 'is shoveling snow more like freeweights or cross-training?'
* No weight tracker. Seriously. One of the easiest features they could have added to a fitness app, and they didn't.
* Time spent charging is counted as 'idle'. Again, seriously. The app only counts 'active' time and 'idle' time, and it apparently didn't occur to them to make a third category for 'charging'. It annoys me tremendously to get the stink-eye from the app for being catatonic for three hours when the band was charging and i was off living my life.
* Very polished, at least, with a facebook-like timeline of activities.
* You can add other people as your 'team' and watch each other's progress, though i haven't used this feature.
* You can enter you food and drink, but i haven't used that feature either.
* You can track your mood, with a set of simple icons and an editable field to add a small bit of text.

Ultimately, i got this to shame myself into taking more steps every day. It'll do that. I like keeping a rough eye on how much sleep i get, but as i mentioned above, it's pretty inaccurate if you spend any amount of time awake in bed lying quietly. It is pretty infuriating, though, to clean the mud off my band and sync it only to find that it registered no activity at all while i was pushing wheelbarrows full of dirt up a hill.

11 Mar 2014: Removed comments re: swim feature since Jawbone has added this to the app
11 Mar 2014: Added comments re: lack of informal exercise options",Still needs a LOT of work,True,2
B00AE1TWE0,5.0,"Good device that is going to change my life in many ways, I hope. The price was right and I think it might help me achieve my goals before too long, I bet. I've always been good about changing my life so here we go again. Life is like a river with changing shorelines and swamp grass.","Rave, Not Rage!",True,
B00AE1TWE0,1.0,These bracelets are so cool and I like them a lot but I just had my second one break within 3 months of getting it. I'm not excessively rough with it either. Having jawbone replace the first one was a pain and I'm dreading having to call them again. This color also tarnishes quickly and it is hard to clean.,I've had two of these...,True,
B00AE1TWE0,1.0,"I have now had two of these wristbands.  The first lasted 3 months, the second also lasted just under 4 months.

The first band stopped holding a charge. This happened shortly after I showered with it, so I assumed perhaps I had gotten it too wet, so I blamed it on myself, and purchased another.  The second just stopped holding a charge and my phone doesn't recognize it.  So, I'm now out $250 for two bands.

THE GOOD:  this band is extremely comfortable and lightweight. I think it does a really good job knowing how far I've run/walked and counting steps.  The calibration works well and within a week it is perfectly in tune to my step and pace.  The sleep mode is accurate from what I can tell, and it's very easy to put it into sleep mode.  It comes out automatically after 250 steps, so I don't have to remember to reset it. It has a lot of nice features in the app, and can really give you some insight as to your activity level.  It is very easy to sync, the app is easy to use, and I love that it integrates with MyFitnessPal.  I like the band so much I've toyed with getting a 3rd one (third time's a charm), but I'm still wavering.  I will say I have a friend who got one at the same time as my first one and she has had no problems.

THE BAD:  Neither of my bands ever held a charge for more than 5-6 days, even though it said 10 days and was fully charged.  That's not a big problem, as it's very easy to charge.  The first one, I lost the cap off the end while I was outside, but they are easy to replace and it didn't impact the band's working capability.  The worst thing, however, is they just keep breaking.  I don't do a lot of manual labor, or hard activity - I have an office job and mostly work out in the gym on a cardio machine or treadmill, so I haven't put it through a lot.  Out of the blue it will just stop working.  They are too expensive and it's too much trouble to keep replacing something, so I will try the FitBit Force next.","Great device, if it would only work",True,
B00AE1TWE0,2.0,"Granted, the price has come down due to replacement models but please keep in mind that wearables will be the thing in 2014. You'll have every option between Fitbit/Jawbone to new Pebble / Gear / Agent smartwatches with many configurations and designs which will outweight the benefit of this device.

For example. The Agent Smartwatch will be a pedometer, as well as a cyclometer, and interface with Windows Phone, iOS, and Android.

The reason why I am writing this today is because I've replaced three bands in the last six months. I can't warn people away enough, and I can't sell this thing used and just throw my money away. Consider alternatives, but consider staying away from these types of devices in general.

The Jawbone does have a very neat function in that it can act as a vibrating smart alarm and power nap alarm, as well as remind you to get moving if you've sat around for too long. If you have the finds for such a device then this works well without waking up your significant other. Apart from that, I'd skip it. There are other pedometers out there for far less, and apart from the social media aspect work just fine as intended.","Not enough to warrant the cost, and three replacements (total 4 bands) in six months.",False,
B00AE1TWE0,1.0,Charged it then it locks out and the reset button doesn't work it is bad product I am throwing it away and buying a FitBit,Doesn't work,True,
B00AE1TWE0,5.0,"Gave this to my wife, she wears it all the time and loves getting the feedback. She has small wrists, both medium and small would have fit, she wanted the medium, and is happy with it.",Great present!,True,
B00AE1TWE0,1.0,"it worked fine for about 2 weeks when it stopped accepting a charge. now its just a fancy/weird bracelet. seemed to track fine for the 2 weeks, but who cares at this point.",Stopped working after 2 weeks,False,
B00AE1TWE0,4.0,"Like my title says works great, but I have broken 2, at lest they have gone wacky. Both have been replaced but in less than a year 2 failures is too much to give 5 stars. Yes they did replace them after helping me troubleshoot them, that gets them back to 4 stars.

I love how it tracks my 'sleep' it really tracks my motion and in sleep mode. Movement translates it to awake, light sleep or deep sleep. It seems accurate as I am usually tired if I don't get 4 hours deep sleep, light sleep doesn't seem to matter but awake does. Wish they were more reliable because I love it.

you can sync it with programs like My fitness Pal that is to keep track of what you eat. The two programs work well together on my phone.
I will likely buy another if the warranty is out and this one dies.","works great, I can track my sleep now.",True,
B00AE1TWE0,3.0,"I have tried several of these fit bit,s and now jaw bone and here is my assessment.

-  none are ready for prime time just yet
- jaw bone is the most stylish and easiest to take on and off
- this not working wirelessly is a killer for me
- since i primarily want to track my exercise and sleep tracking is not important my phone actually does a better job

Bottom line is that if you want a stylish band to wear with some functionality tracking your sleep and activity you can't do with a smart phone app lys okay.  For me the phone does a better job for much less $$ for exercise tracking.",its okay but not really worth the money-smart phone apps do a better job for me,True,
B00AE1TWE0,5.0,"The most interesting feature of the Up! is not advertised by Jawbone, namely the attention it recieves. Any time you're wearing it (all of the time) anyone who sees it and recognizes what it is, wants to stop and talk about it.

It's an interesting way to meet people that are intersted in fitness.

Another interesting feature is the ability to build a team. My wife and boy both have the Up! band and we can all see each other's activity and keep each other motivated.

My only complaint is that there isn't a native iPad app. The iPhone app works on the iPad, but it's not optimized for it, or full screen.",Fun toy. Interesting tool. Odd jewlery.,True,
B00AE1TWE0,1.0,"Up 24 was a Christmas gift. I was so excited because I didn't even ask for it, so I couldn't wait to get it started. Jawbone tries to be simple, with simple packaging and simple operation, thinking everything is cool, but it's not. They need to go back to the drawing board. First it just comes with little instructions to tell you to go to this website to download an app to operate the device. Which this device limits you to certain devices only portable devices such as iPad, iPhone and Android mobile device products. Ok, whatever, The app was secretive enough you can't find it on App Store or Google Play you HAVE to go to their website. It's a hassle to even locate the download button on the freakin screen! After spending sometime trying to download the app and get it to my iPad. The next step is to connect the headphone plug to the device, thinking, nice finally time to get started, NOPE! The boneheads made the plug too small to fit in my iPad, iPhone, Android!!! It does come with an attachment to a USB cable. What is it for!?!? Nothing in the instruction talks about the usb attachment! You can't plug it in a laptop or desktop and use this thing, so what's the point!? Helloooo, iPads don't have USB ports dummy! RETURNING!",Bonehead Idiots!,False,
B00AE1TWE0,1.0,"I sent this one back. I have owned several Jawbone products, and currently use my Jawbone Icon and my Jambox on a very regular basis. I found the Jawbone Up to quite Uncomfortable. I was not comfortable enough wearing it to gain any insight towards its accuracy or the usability of its accompanying app. It just didn't feel ""attached"" with it's twist on your wrist non-closure, and I packed it for return in very short order.

B00AE1TWE0,1.0,"Before buying, I read the reviews here.  It seemed like a 50/50 bet; half liked it a lot, half hated it.  I figured maybe I'd be one of the lucky ones what wouldn't have the common issue of the band dying.  I was wrong.  It died.  It was outside the warranty period, so I'm out all this money.  Do not waste your money on this thing.  As of today (12/29/2013), more people have rated this 1-star than have rated it 5-stars.  Unfortunately, I joined the 1-star list.  Right now, my Up band is in the garbage.  There is no possible way I will waste my money on buying a new one.",Don't waste your money,False,
B00AE1TWE0,3.0,"Ok, this thing gave out within about 3 weeks, so that alone should give it only a one star.  However, the three weeks that it did work, it work fantastic.  I returned it and Amazon like always gave me a full refund.  Also the medium was a little too small, so ended up purchasing a large in the blue.",This should be a one star but...,True,
B00AE1TWE0,4.0,"Recently got this as a gift.
I really like the Blue color on it.
Simple one button functions for switching from normal mode to sleeping mode.
or tracking a activities.
No screen to check how your progress is currently but I am happy with it.
It don't require wifi or bluetooth connection 24/7 which will kill my phone battery which is a big up for me as I already use alot of battery life doing other stuff with my phone.
Only sync when you plug the Jawbone into your phone which is good enough for me as I usually don't need to know how many steps I have taken after each hours.

Easy to use food & drink tracking as they offer 3 different method  to track for example typing, scanning bar code or taking a photo and enter your own nutrition data.

Don't like to wear it to sleep like me? You can enter the sleeping data manually.

sitting in chair too long you can set a certain amount of time to remind you to get your butt up and walk around lol.

Wish Jawbone Up would release a Blackberry Z10 App to work with the current Up band. As I am running a Android version on the Blackberry Z10. Most feature work great like viewing data and stuff but usually when hitting back button on certain part of the app it would crash other than that I find this jawbone to fit my daily usage very well.",I am a UPSER!,False,
B00AE1TWE0,5.0,Easy to use. App is good on iphone. Motivates you to move more. Fun to track your progress. Walk on!,A good fitness gadget,True,
B00AE1TWE0,2.0,"As far as fitness trackers go, I would say that the Jawbone Up is the best looking one. Being a major fitness junkie and a gadget geek, I like to try several products, even if I don't need some of them. My purchase of the Jawbone Up was one such purchase. Already having a Nike Fuelband, I really didn't need another band. Yet, as impulsive as ever, I walked by it in the gadget section one day and couldn't turn away. This thing is gorgeous. While the Fuelband makes me look like a convict wearing some kind of 24/7-surveillance device, the Jawbone Up looks like I'm making some type of fashion statement.

Aside from the looks, it has many positives. The vibrating feature is nifty, as is the flexibility of the band. The Fuelband is VERY rigid, and I often find it seizing up around my wrist when it twists in an odd position. The Jawbone Up never does so. Additionally, the tracking on this band is very accurate. Compared to the Nike Fuelband, the Jawbone Up definitely tracks actual steps better, missing fewer and over-counting less. So far, so good.

Now let's talk about the major flaws. The first (and lesser) is the Jawbone's application interface. While competitors' interfaces play nice by syncing up with popular fitness tracking/aggregating sites like Endomondo and Earndit, the Jawbone Up does not. That means that, most of the time, you're stuck in Jawbone's interface. They have had a developer kit out for a while, yet no link-up with popular sites (especially Endomondo) leads me to believe that Jawbone simply feels like keeping its users strapped to just their interface. Nike users have complained about the proprietary nature of Nike ""Fuel""... I'd argue that the Jawbone offends worse on that front.

And the bigger, much MUCH more serious flaw: no PC app. There's a USB cable, yet you can't sync via PC (as of late 2013, this is still the case); the cable is just for charging. I was unaware of this when I purchased the band. Annoyed, I figured I would have to use the Android app. No such luck either, as my phone was a Blackberry and my Android device, a Google Nexus 7, isn't supported. If you plan on purchasing this band, you HAVE to make sure that you're an iPhone user or that your Android phone is definitely in the list of supported devices. And the only way to sync is by plugging the damn thing into your headphone jack on your phone. It's nifty/weird, and unnecessarily ""different"". And when doing so, it's easy to lose or break the little silver cap that covers the headphone plug, as evidenced by the fact that Jawbone sells packs of replacement caps. I've since picked up an iPhone 5, and so I can use this band now. But, aside from some initial testing and experimenting, I still use my Fuelband instead. I keep telling myself that I will switch to the Jawbone Up permanently if my Fuelband breaks, but the latter is chugging along like a tank.

All in all, the Jawbone Up comes off as more of an exercise in making consumer jump through hoops than providing an actual fitness tracker that they can enjoy. It seriously has so much potential, but Jawbone's bizarre choices in software and hardware development make me question whether they even once considered what the user experience would be like.","Great looking band, but a some serious flaws BESIDES the infamous death of the band.",False,4
B00AE1TWE0,4.0,"I like it for what it is.  A glorified pedometer and a decent sleep monitor.  It works much better than my last sleep monitor whose warranty problems were so severe that the company largely disappeared while waiting for the warranties to expire.

After 10 months, it failed. I walked through all the troubleshooting without success.  However, the customer service was excellent -- they gave me an even longer list of things to try and even followed up when I didn't respond in 24 hours. A soft reset was all it needed so we're back in action. Give customer support a chance -- much, much better than what I expected reading reviews.",Cool technology -- Good Support,True,
B00AE1TWE0,3.0,"So I have been a Jawbone UP band owner for about a year now. I waited until the ""fixed"" the first generation problems and bought the second version. The band is comfortable to wear all day and night long. I literally bought it for the pedometer style functionality and the sleep tracker. I have been pretty happy with those features.

What I have not been happy with is the fact that I am now on my 3rd warranty replacement and my 1 year is about up so I'm not sure how long this one will last. I will give credit to Jawbone support they have been great so no issues there but the band clearly has quality issues they have not ironed out. The first band died from water I know for sure. The second one I am certain the battery was faulty.

So my experience over the last year has been that the band, since it is an open design, catches on clothing quite a bit. I have had it come off putting on coats and sweaters which gets really annoying. I am not a fan of the cap since it is easily lost but hey you do get more battery life since the device lacks blue tooth. It's a trade off nonetheless since most people complain it lacks bluetooth. Yes it would be nice but I can deal without it for the 10 day battery life. Is it really 10 days? Well if you sleep track and are active I'd say 7 days is realistic.

The app for phones is not bad but really lacks any kind of usefulness. It is nice to see what your friends are doing but there is not much you can do. I can add workouts like weightlifting but I get no additional insight. So if you are in the market for a simple pedometer with sleep tracking then this is a pretty good product once they get the quality issues figured out. Anything else I would look toward Amiigo or FitBit. I hope this helps someone anyway.

I would have rated 2 stars but great customer service deserved the additional star. Jawbone truly is trying to help their customers and that goes a long way.",Good effort for a first to market product but falls short of expectations,False,
B00AE1TWE0,4.0,"I have shopped for one of these for a while.  I originally purchased the Fitbit One a while back, but returned it when I found that it did not support my phone, only a small list of 5 Android phones,  I waited until the 2nd Gen band came out for Jawbone to buy.  I have currently had for 1 week and only had 1 hiccup so far.  When setting the band up with the phone app it seemed to freeze at one point.  I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it worked fine.

I decided on the UP instead of the UP24, 1. Because I have an Android phone, and 2.  The only difference is the bluetooth sync in the UP24 which takes away 3 days of battery life.

I am an ER Nurse, it cleans easily with alcohol.  I take it off when I shower, and I avoid overly flexing it.

The app is easy to use, I love the Smart Alarm.

One other thing.  They are shipped with a partial charge from the factory.  Mine was completely dead.  When charging there is a pulsating sun light, when fully charged it is solid and non-pulsating.  Yours may come charged and not pulsate.

My biggest beef with it....it catches on my clothes because it doesn't completely close. I had a bad habit of forgetting to ""tell it"" when I was going to sleep.

B00AE1TWE0,2.0,"I got this as a gift from the wife who uses the Nike device.

Pros:
Looks good;
Fits comfortably:
Better charging port as compared to Nike
Splash proof
Tracks sleep

Cons:
No Display;
No wireless sync with phone;
Accidentally can switch between Night and Day if your wrist hits something;
No Display again

If I had not gotten this as a gift I would not be using it.  There are other devices out there that are cheaper that have a display (Fitbit One).  There are also more expensive devices that are more functional for everyday use besides tracking activity and sleep.  Android watches that are just now starting to hit the market, the Toq, and lets not forget the rumored watch from Apple.

UPDATE 1/22/14:  After a few months with this device I have decided to lower it to two stars from the original three I had put.  The first reason is that synching with my Android Phone can be hit or miss.  Clearing the cache works most of the time but if not I have to restart the phone.  Sometimes if I just wait an hour it will then work when I try again.  The second reason is that remembering to turn sleep mode on and off can be a pain.  When you are tired you don't always remember to switch it to sleep and when you wake up turning it off sleep is not a priority.  I have also found that even if I turn sleep on, it is off by the time I wake up.  This maybe due to the switch.
I am almost at the point of giving this thing to my nephew or 3 year old son.",Okay if you got it for free,False,

BUT!
I had to call them twice to send me a new one. After the first 3 months it died. I called they sent a new one. Then 3 months later again dead.
I kept the new one they sent me in the original package and I will try to sell it this time and get the newer model.
Over all it's a awesome product but I'm really frustrated at the life span of these things",Best band on the market but very short lifespan.,True,
B00AE1TWE0,3.0,"The Jawbone UP is the best ANDROID device out there for its' purposes. It can't be, in my opinion, the best overall device for wearable fitness tech.

COMFORTABILITY

There are inherent issues with wearing a band 24 hours a day are suppressed in my opinion with this band. It is not nearly as uncomfortable while sleeping as you might think. It occaisionally will snag some arm hair, but it could be a lot worse. I am not a jewelry guy, meaning I never wear any jewelry, including a wedding ring. This band is comfortable enough for me to wear without it being too much of an issue

THE APP

The app can be extremely useful, telling you when you woke up to go to the bathroom, or showing you where you are the laziest throughout a day. However there's bad parts to the application as well...for instance, the lack of friends. It becomes difficult to find people to be in your circle, becasue let's face it, your friends don't have Jawbone UP.

The CAP

I think the cap isn't nearly as losable as people claim. I am the WORST when it comes to finding things...in fact, I have no idea on earth where my wallet is, and haven't for 2 weeks. But the cap is easy to not lose. You only have to charge this device every 10 days, and it takes an hour or so to charge. So put the cap next to it and BAM, it's there every time.

SYNCING AND WHY IT ISNT THE BEST

When you sync this device, it can take a minute or two. The longer it has been between syncs, the longer it will take. The problem I have is that it uses a 3.5 mm jack (headphone jack) that requires that you remove it. Now I might be insane, but I don't want a constant wireless connection between my phone and my arm, but I don't want to take devices off to find out how many steps I've taken.

This is where the Nike FuelBand comes in. That thing will tell you without having to do anything. It also syncs wirelessly on demand without having to take it off. That being said, if you have android, you don't have that option. Therefore, the Jawbone UP is the best.

WATERPROOF TEST:

I have worn this in the shower, but try not to. I have jumped in the pool once with it on accidentally, and all is well.

CONCLUSION:

This band is comfortable and can tell you a lot about your daily and nightly habits, but it's not the best in the industry. There are issues, but the biggest issue is unsolvable unless you have an Apple phone.",Best wearable fitness band for android.,True,

I've worn this thing to semiformal events and no one pays attention to it. (I'm a woman, so we're not talking long sleeves at these events.) The program works with both Android and Iphones (not all bands perform well with Android; this does.)

The bad news is that it breaks;it would be a 5 star otherwise. And, I've found, so does the charger--in fact, I suspect charger breaks are responsible for half the noise on the Internet about UP bands that don't charge. Don't let anyone tell you they don't break, and I've found that men break these faster (in 10 days to 3 months) than women (4-5 months). OTOH, people in my division have the UP, the Nike, and Fitbit all seem to have their problems as well--and they look a lot uglier than the UP.

Don't expect a $700 heart monitor; none of the bands are. All of them are approximate calories, steps, etc. However, this is a very easy, very wearable way to start getting actual feedback on whether parking in the back of the lot actually gains you something, and what your intake really consists of. My friends also really like the sleep app; I suspect this thing could diagnose sleep apnea pretty easily. At the very least, you get instant feedback on whether those two glasses of wine you had last night before bed made a different in the quality of your sleep. Try it; it's a great first step to getting actual data about your well being.","Looks better than others, works as well...great first step into better fitness",True,3
B00AE1TWE0,5.0,The only thing better than this awesome gadget is the customer service provided by Jawbone if something goes wrong.  The end cap came off my band after only a couple of months.

B00AE1TWE0,5.0,"Best device I've worn to track my exercise workouts, steps taken, what time I go to actual sleep, if I'm in a light sleep or deep REM sleep, calorie intake (by taking images of the QR on the packaged food I eat) calories burned.  I never take it off unless I'm swimming.  I shower with it on.  All information uploads to my iPhone (new app for many, many other phones now).  This UP is the second generation.  Do NOT purchase the first generation.  Too many problems.  Also, this company is the best.  I purchased a band for my Doctor, Lawyer, Banker, Sister, Nurse in the Doctor's office and 2 more for friends.  The Doctor's band stopped uploading after many months of perfect service, and the company traded her a brand new band for the old one, no questions asked.  Get the band a little smaller, because it tends to open up a little more with use.  A power nap can be programmed into the band, a timer goes off if you sit too long to remind you to get up and move, and there is an alarm you can set to awaken you.  You set the band for your gender, height, weight and age.  It sounds like I work for the company, but I don't.  I just love the UP.  I was being awakened every morning around 4 a.m., and didn't know why.  The band clearly showed the disturbance of my REM sleep at that time.  I set the alarm for 3:45 a.m., and waited.  At 4 a.m., the paperboy's headlights shone into my bedroom window, which disturbed my sleep.  Got heavier blinds, and now sleep deeply through his delivery.  I highly recommend this band and this wonderful company.","I have purchased 8 of these Jawbone UPs, 7 for gifts to improve health of friends.  They WORK!",True,3

I read that the first introduction of this product was fraught with technical failure.

B00AE1TWE0,4.0,"I purchased this Up band at a local box store several months ago.  I chose it because of its look, as well as reviews that I read.  I wanted to get a closer approximation of my activities than my rough guesses were providing and I wanted to see what it would tell me about my sleep habits.
I can say that it does both relatively well, but I have some reservations.

OVERALL (short version):
Simple to wear, does not fall off easy.
Loss of cap lessens appearance.  Wish this was more integrated so not easy to lose.
Only output on band itself is lights, need to sync for data
Need to plug in for data (no wireless or BT), so low impact battery-wise
7-day battery is nice
Data is not portable, limited to use in apps
Data on sleep, not sure how to use, no non-pay apps to use this with, except for basics.

INITIAL SETUP:
This was a bit rocky only in that the band did not at first work.  I plugged it into my computers USB port for a while and it still did not work.  I found out that was user error, as my USB does not charge on my computer unless the lid is open.  Did not know that.  Finally it started up and I was in business.  Created my account and I was all set.

USAGE:
Its a bracelet, this is straightforward.  However if you are female, you need to pick something that goes with your jewelry.  I don't wear any (unless Im going out), so that was easy. But given that I like to wear dressy bracelets on occasion, this was a minor issue.  So I just didn't wear it then. Kinda defeats the purpose if it is a night out dancing, but such is life.
I never wore it in the shower, though it says you can.
There are two pieces to this bracelet.  One being the main bracelet and the other being an end cap to cover the connector that goes in your computer USB connector.  I lost the end cap after a month (my mistake, it did not fall off) so it does not look as cool as it used to.  I can probably buy one online, if I had to.
Also this bracelet, though it has no latch, but it just shaped and springy, has only come off twice on me in several months of usage.  Once while sleeping and another time when my cat for some reason, thought he needed to run off with it.

To see the data you need to sync by attaching this to your phone earpiece connection.  This takes a few seconds if only a day or so of data, or a little longer if it has been a while.

DATA:
Lets cut to the chase, you have a few things you can do.  I never used it as a stop watch of any type, so I cant speak to that, but you have to tell it when you are going to sleep and when you wake.  Forget that step and you have compromised your data.  I forgot telling it I was going to sleep a few times and it just shows the sleep cycle as missing.

For awake you get the frequency and intensity of your workouts.  So if you jogged or walked a mile, it will be well noted. Do Pilates or Yoga and it will be more impressed by your walk to these activities, so obviously intensity is not by heart rate, but by movement of the device.

For asleep you get times when you were awake, light sleep and deep sleep.  I can only assume it determines this based on your movement when it has been notified that you are sleeping.  For a time, I used this band with a WiThings Pulse at the same time and the data was different.  Not sure why.  So I don't know how valuable this information is.  There is a Sleepio App you can port this to (and costs for membership to do so after the initial period), but I saw no other way for you to look at the data except for the UP app itself.  I never joined Sleepio.

I will continue to see if this information can be pushed to a computer, as I would like a chance to push this into an excel spreadsheet and look at trends.  Without that this band becomes less and less useful for me.

SOFTWARE ON PHONE:
This is very simple and very graphical.  Easy to visualize what it is telling you.
For example, if you want to walk 10,000 steps a day, you will get told if you met that goal or not right on the front screen. You can get the exact data within.  Similarly if you get less than 8 hours of sleep, you know that on the top screen (only on weekends for me).  If you think you were up from 3:23AM to 4AM, you can see that too.  I did note, however that there are times I thought I was awake and the band recorded this as light sleep. Not 100% sure if it was right or I was.

What I found hard to do, was compare trends in data.  For instance, is my deep sleep increasing from day to day or not.  What are the trends?  This is done with a bar chart in the app, but, not detailed enough for me.  I would also know in these sets if there was a gap in the data and it does not show that, unless I look back on daily.

I don't know how much longer I will wear the band.  Im not sure what to do with the data.  I had gotten it primarily to examine my sleeping and to see if I was getting the 10,000 steps a day I should (no I only get 6000 regularly and 12000 to 15000 on more active days). I might continue to wear it, to see if I can get regularly up to the 10000 steps.

COMPARING TO THE WITHINGS PULSE
At first I preferred the Withings pulse when I got it after, as it shows data right on it.  I liked also the fact you could see the time. It also does heart rate on request.  However I found since it was not on my wrist like the Up band (thought it has a wrist strap, that is recommended only for night-time wear), I tended to wear it less and less. The data also that I got seemed less accurate. If you hang it on a belt loop the floppiness of the belt loop can make 100 steps look like 15.  The velcroed band was bigger and fell off at night a lot.
I don't care that the data is sent via bluetooth (on the Pulse) that is actually a bit fussier than just plugging the UP in.  The data for all purposes is the same.  Both can go to WiThings, but both are trapped in these apps.","Informative, but limited",False,5
B00AE1TWE0,1.0,"The jack that this bracelet uses to charge and dock has a removable plastic 'end cap' covering it. I've lost 2 two of them in the 2 months or so that I've had this - they get pulled off on shirt sleeves and pants pockets, for example -- and they cost about 8 bucks a piece to replace. It's a bit like having a subscription charge for the bracelet! Not only is this extremely irritating but the software, for android anyway, is buggy, and you need to have an internet connection to view your data instead of having it stored on the phone. Very, very frustrating. Also if you forget to put it into sleep mode, you can manually enter the amount of sleep you got BUT the bracelet doesn't use any of the data it recorded over that period of time, which is bizarre.

B00AE1TWE0,5.0,"I ordered the Fitbit Flex during production, and I was excited to receive it. The day after I received it, I took off on a 6000 mile motorcycle ride across America. The battery lasted three days at the most. The band cracked in less than a week. When I got home I corresponded with Fitbit, and in about two weeks I got a new band. I wore it 24/7 until the battery died then charged it. I have sleeping problems and wanted to track my sleep to work on improving it. The band quickly began to rank because of how the device fits into it.  I used hand sanitizer, Q-tips, Lysol, soap and water but nothing helped. I steamed it hoping to remove he odor. Stank pretty bad. Living in SE Texas the humidity and sweat were inevitable.  I started looking for a new band, because of the smell and because it cracked again. The bands are over $30, so I decided to try the Up. I love the sleep tracker, it s a lot more in depth. I use Sleepio and it takes the data from my Up to do my sleep diary logs. I have used the Up as a silent alarm, and I get a buzz without a rattle.  My cap is tight. The band doesn't smell because it doesn't trap moisture. It has a smaller profile and does not stick out from my wrist as far. Because the band is not a complete circle, it feels more comfortable. If this fails, I would be happy to buy another one. I don't believe it will fail, though. Both the Flex and the Up are not accurate when riding a motorcycle. Days I ride I end up logging an exorbitant amount of steps with either. I guess the vibrations from the handle bars throw them off.",Replaced the fitbit flex with this. I'm happy.,False,
B00AE1TWE0,4.0,"There are a lot of great benefits to the jawbone UP. For me, on the rare day when I have moved less than 10,000 steps it really does motivate me to move around more. I like how it easily links with other apps such as run keeper and myfitness pal. The food tracking part of the UP sucks in my opinion, I just don't like how it presents it on the screen or how it has ""popular"" food items- all of which are processed foods!  It should be promoting healthier eating!  And it also makes it a little more annoying to search for items not in its popular list.  It is also pretty cool to see you sleep cycle.

The cons, for me: I work nights so my sleep is all messed up- I don't need the up band to tell me I should get more sleep to be healthier...as it gives little daily health advice.  There are apps on the iphone that you can use to tell you sleep cycles, steps per day, calories burned and where you can log calorie intake- none of which will cost more than a dollar or two.  Also, the fit is not amazing.  I originally ordered a medium, going by the size chart provided on Jawbones website.  I wore it for about 2 weeks and decided it really was just too big.  I exchanged it for a small, which fits better but not perfect.  The fact that it does not clasp close in any way makes it very easy to catch on end on things.

I must add, customer service reps for UP are amazing!  They sent me a knew size and were very easy to work with.  They also sent the return shipping label so it was very easy to return the old one.  So I'm still torn on whether it really worth $130 or not. It pretty cool but it also has lost its appeal after about 6 weeks of wearing it.  Also, I wish it could automatically sink to my phone!",Still up for debate whether it's worth the cost,True,
B00AE1TWE0,4.0,"I bought my Up through Sprint.  Before having this I had a Bodybugg that I had used for a year.  So far I've used it for about two and a half weeks.

The good things about it:  Unlike the bodybugg, the Up sits on your wrist and since it's light and loose fitting, you can 'almost' forget it's on there.  The reporting it gives you is pretty robust.  Not only does it tell you how long you slept, it tells you how long it took you to get to sleep, light and deep sleep and wakeups at night.  I like the alarm feature.  Having the alarm shake your wrist instead of an alarm clock disturbing your fiance is a great thing and the idle alerts/get off your ass you lazy bum nag feature is really cool, unless you're driving and stuck in the car.  The fact that it's water resistant is a huge plus, especially since I'm getting ready to try some mud runs in the near future.  The battery life is great.  Fully charged it will make it over a week. (It reports it will last 10 days on a full charge but 7-8 is closer for the one I have)  Still, 7-8 days is pretty long for a activity and sleep monitor

The bad things I've seen so far:  The Up has feature that allows you to track your food.  There are better free interafces for entering food (My fitness pal, Lost it, even Bodybugg) that have more food data behind it, more flexibility for entering and tracking and basically kick Up's food feature's ass.  This part can easily be ignored.

A side note:  Remember I said you can almost forget it's on your wrist?  Here's one place you will want to take it off.  If you are in the middle of lovemaking and go to caress your fiance, only to accidentally rub this rubberized band across her (insert sensitive part here), it kind of takes away from the mood.  The band can (and does) catch the sheets which can be annoying.  Also moving your hand around so as to keep from touching her with it, is not very helpful.  Luckily it can be taken off and tossed within 2 seconds and the rubberized band is fairly durable.  You don't need those steps recorded that bad.  Just walk more later.

Overall it's a pretty decent tool.  Really easy to forget it's on.  The plusses outweigh the minuses.  If Jawbone revamps the food portion and maybe made the outside smooth, then you'd have a pretty awesome tool for $120.",Functional activity and sleep monitor,False,

B00AE1TWE0,3.0,"I've been wearing a Jawbone UP for about 10 months now, and I really love it. But I'm on my third model. The first two had to be replaced under warranty. They obviously are still having quality assurance issues. The first one I wore in the shower. The second and now third one I take extra steps to keep it away from water just in case water incursion is what broke the first one. But the second one had the same issues, so I don't know. I am satisfied with Jawbone support. After a short email exchange they ship out a new model and let me send mine back after I receive the new one.

The only thing I would change other than the QA issues is wireless. I would like to see low power Bluetooth that could do a daily sync with my phone. Having to take off the cap and manually plug into the phone to sync seems very 2008. If I had to guess I'd say the 3rd generation UP band (if there is one) would have this capability.

I should mention that nobody needs to pay the ridiculous price being listed here. You can purchase these for $129 directly from Jawbone's website. The price gouging of $169 by EOM Distributors is shameful.","A Good Product, Could Use Improvements",False,
B00AE1TWE0,3.0,"I've had the UP for several months now and have generally been impressed by it.  The UP isn't perfect, but it is pretty good.  Here's my take on it:

Pros
- It has certainly prodded me to be more active.  When I first started using it,  I found I was fairly sedentary, walking only about 1,500 steps a day.  Now that I'm aware of that, my average has more than tripled.

- Once you get in the habit, the UP makes it fairly easy to keep track of what you eat.  The interface is easy to use and includes most of the food I eat.

- The UP and iPhone app are easy to use.

- The idle alert feature helps prevent me from sitting too long.

- I really like being able to see my activity and sleep trends because it lets me correlate how I feel with the amount of sleep and exercise I'm getting.  While it seems like a no-brainer that less sleep and exercise means you'll be more tired, it is amazing how quickly you can fall into bad habits without noticing -- particularly not getting enough sleep.  Although I knew I wasn't getting enough sleep, seeing that I was only averaging 5 or so hours a night made it very real.

Cons
- Size.  Jawbone needs to make a larger size band.  I guess I have fairly thick wrists and large size is just barely adequate.  I wish it were a bit larger.

- Thickness.  It's only a minor issue, but the UP is a bit thick and clunky.

- Sleep tracking needs work.  In general, it seems to paint a fairly accurate picture of my sleep patterns, but there are some annoying issues.  No matter how long it take me to go to sleep, the UP always indicates that I fell asleep in 11 minutes.  I have no idea why.  It also does not seem to accurately measure when or for how long I wake up during the night unless I actually get out of bed.  If Jawbone explained exactly how the UP tracks sleep patterns it could help put this problem to rest (pun intended) , but I haven't been able to find such an explanation anywhere.

Bottom line is that I like the UP and it has helped me improve my fitness.  I just wish it were a bit better.","I like it, but...",True,
B00AE1TWE0,2.0,"I wanted to start tracking my activity level and started looking at the Nike Fuel Band, then compared the Up Band 2.0 from Jawbone.

I like being able to input the foods I eat throughout the day and track calories, sodium, etc. I compared the acruracy of the bands pedometer on the treadmill and it's pretty accurate.

UPDATED March 2014:

Sent jawbone support an email, two days later I received a response telling me to do a soft reset.

Emailed support back after following their instructions advising the issue didn't get resolved...three days later and I still haven't heard back...disappointing.

I realized after wearing it for only a few days that I was nowhere close to getting the minimum of 10,000 steps a day or even worse getting in the right number of hours of sleep in a night.  I was lucky to average 3,000 to 5,000 steps in a day and that was an active day for me.  Since I started tracking my steps have increased my average walking to about 15,000 to 18,000 steps a day, in fact last month I walked 223 miles which is incredible for me which equates to about 472,000 steps!  I've lost 24 pounds since I started wearing the UP and hope to lose an additional 30 pounds in the next year.

Here's why.

The Jawbone UP band I purchased died - would not charge - after the return window for the band closed. So, I was only left with calling Jawbone support. They will only issue refunds for bands purchased from THEIR OWN ONLINE STORE. So, after two instances where the band died suddenly I was told the following:

1) I was using the band ""improperly"" by letting it run all the way down to no charge
2) By letting it charge overnight - more than 80 minutes, I may have ""fried"" the band

Jawbone is willing to replace the band for me, under warranty, for the second time. At this rate I will go through three to five bands before the warranty is ""UP."" So, here's a $129 device that requires a LOT of attention. You have to bring a charger with you when you are out hiking, like I was yesterday, or risk having the band die. You have to pay close attention to the amount of charging time lest you ""fry"" the band by leaving it connected to the charger for too long.

I have a lot of battery operated devices. None require such attention. The ""UP"" is supposed to be a lifestyle device, but I am unwilling to alter my lifestyle to keep this device working - I'd rather throw it out.

I have asked Jawbone support for a refund. They refused. I have asked for a credit towards another Jawbone product - I was offered a 25% discount off of another purchase from their store. I refused. I have asked for a $129 credit on their store, and am waiting to hear - will update this review when they get back to me.

To Amazon:

you really should stop selling these, as the support / remedies you can provide are lesser than Jawbone will provide to their own customers. This puts your customers at an extreme disadvantage, so I would take these off of Amazon.com - as this is not the good experience Amazon customers expect.

B00AE1TWE0,3.0,"I purchased this item from the Amazon Warehouse for less than fifty bucks in 'like new' condition. (Check Other Buying Options to the right if you're interested in these types of deals.) It was a birthday gift to myself, which I'd researched online prior to my purchase.  I knew its limitations and what the UP could do for me, with the free UP app on my iPhone and/or iPad.  The price was right, so I took a risk and bought one.  Here's my experience.

OUT OF THE BOX:
My UP didn't come with instructions, so I had to go online to find out how to charge it and the controls for the sleep function.  I found it tough to know when it was fully charged, and while the directions were clear, my UP wasn't.  Eventually I figured it out, but I think there was a bit of luck involved.  Initially I thought about sending it back as defective, but alas, it was me!

In the box is the UP, a USB charger (very small and easy to lose) and directions (if you buy the retail version.)  The box has the basics on it: WEAR, SYNC, and ACT.  The idea is to learn more about yourself; your sleeping, activity and eating patterns.  Ideally you'd use this information to move more, sleep better and eat more healthfully.

TEST RUN for 1 WEEK:
I downloaded the UP by Jawbone app from the AppStore to be able to sync the UP with my iPhone and iPad. The band works with the app, so ideally you should have it installed prior to your first wearing, because you'll connect the band to your device to set-up your account to sync data.

Despite measuring and getting a 5.25"" measurement for my wrist, the band initially felt too small. (I got a SMALL size.)  I decided to wear it anyway and within a day, forgot I had it on.  It doesn't seem to matter if the band is close to your hand or up farther on your forearm for it to work.  It also doesn't seem to matter if the ends of the band are inside your wrist or up, although the directions picture it as the silver ends are on the same side as the palm of your hand.

You can wear the band in the shower, but the recommendation is not to submerge it.  I took it off to shower, as I didn't want to test this one and ruin it.

I wore the band to the gym and while doing my daily stuff.  I wore it to bed, changing the setting to 'sleep' as I went to bed each night, and then resuming the active monitor in the day.  I found the timed recording of my sleep to be fairly accurate.  I also found the steps recorded to be on par with a pedometer I also wore at the same time to see how accurate the UP was for me.

The tough part about getting the full UP experience is accurately adding your food into the UP app.  I forget to do it and thus, no accurate info.  I do find the sleep info helpful, and a good reminder to get more of it and to work towards quality sleep.  Seeing the intensity of my workouts on a graph is a great motivator, as is seeing my resting burn rate go up with more activity.

Overall, I like it.  I'm not convinced it's the most accurate record of everything I do, but part of that is on me.  It find it helpful and motivating. I think twice before eating a cookie as I look down at my wrist at my UP while I grab for it.

If I'd paid more, would I be as happy with it?  I don't know.  It seems to be priced fairly high, and only you know if that price is equivalent to the feedback you'll gain from wearing it.

Prior to purchasing, make sure you have the required hardware to sync with the UP by Jawbone and the free UP app available from the AppStore.

REQUIREMENTS for the UP by JAWBONE:

- iOS 5.3 or higher
- iPhone 3GS or later
- iPod Touch (3rd Gen or later)
- iPad

UPDATE: 10/12/13

The longer I use the Jawbone the more I like it for tracking my sleep patterns, and seeing weekly updates of my activity.  I've gotten used to wearing it, but initially (even after measuring for proper fit) the medium size seemed way too small - even though I have very small wrists, as told to me by my friends anyway.  Now I think maybe the snug fit actually helps with accuracy!

Battery life seems to be great with this product and syncing with my iPhone 4S is quickly accomplished each day.

UPDATE: 7/1/14

The Jawbone will not hold a charge or power up. It's dead. I am not happy with its durability, as I barely used it and it was never in water or similar.","Pricey, but the comfort, feedback and usability make me like it -  UPDATE: 7/1/14",True,2

B00AE1TWE0,4.0,"I bought the UP Band on June 2nd at an Apple Store and it worked well for a month.  On July 5th it wouldn't charge anymore.  I tried plugging it into the USB port on my computer and my wife's laptop but it wouldn't charge.  I called Jawbone support on the 6th, spoke to Vonya, and after describing the problem she said it was completely dead and they would send out a new one.  She said Jawbox's policy was customers need to send the defective item back first before a replacement was sent.  But since it was less than a month since I bought it a new one would be send first.  A tracking number would be emailed to me once it was sent.
July 11th I called support again and spoke to Marj who told me the color I bought (large white) was on backorder until the following week and I should expect to be sent Fed Ex ground a replacement on the 16th followed by an email.  I explained that I was upset and they could at least overnight it, which her manager approved.
July 18th I hadn't received an email with the tracking number for my replacement.  I called on July 18th and spoke to Keira.  I told her the situation and she stated that a partial order of large white UP Bands came in, but it wasn't enough to fill my order.  She then said they were expecting another batch of large white UP Bands to come in on the 19th and possibly I would be sent a replacement out of that.  I told her the I'm unhappy about being sold a defective product and want either a refund or an ETA on the replacement.  She said I could have a replacement band that was a different color (green or blue) but Jawbone doesn't issue refunds, that I would have to go back to the retailer I bought it from (which is too late because the Apple Store return policy was 30 days).  I said no and I would wait.
July 20th I called and wanted to talk with a manager.  I was put on hold for 20 minutes and Elida picked up the phone.  She said the same thing as the previous 3 customer service representatives, that she wanted to make sure I was clear on the fact Jawbone will not issue a refund for this product.  She told me she had the product for months and no problems.  I said there are poor reviews on Amazon (58 so far for this month) stating similar problems like I had.  This is a defective product that I spend $140 for.  Elida said there isn't an ETA for more replacement bands and I could have either a blue or an onyx colored band but those are my only options.  I'm not satisfied with that and she said she'd make a note of that in my file.
Update July 24:
July 22nd I received an email from Jawbone corporate office saying they understood my concern and frustration, they take the delay in sending out a replacement seriously, and a new large white UP Band would be sent via Fed Ex Overnight that morning. I received it today and after charging it I'm pleased that it is working.

B00AE1TWE0,2.0,"I received my UP in January and after 5 months on my 3rd.  The first didn't track steps well.
They replaced it - but this took weeks.

My first UP customer-service experience:
You can submit a problem on their site and they generally get back to you in 2 days.  It only takes a few back-and-forth communications for this to add up to weeks.
I did call to get it straightened out, and that SEEMED to work.  Via phone I was told I'd be sent something to return the UP and once they received it I'd be sent a new one.  BUT - there was no record of this communication.  After a week I called again and it was as if I made that all up.
So I went back to communicating via email/web-site ... at least there is a record of that.

The replacement counted steps ok, but the sleep feature is useless.  It only recognizes waking if I get up and walk.  I wake far more often than that and it doesn't detect it.

The 2nd unit worked for a couple months then died.  Again it took a while to get a replacement.
At least this time they didn't make me send back mine first.  I really didn't want a replacement at this point and asked if I could get credit towards another Jawbone product - nope, just a replacement.
The latest UP works the same as the last - tracks steps ok, sleep data is meaningless.

Something to realize - when you sync to your iphone, you won't see the data until it's been uploaded to them.  So you need an internet connection.  I noticed this on vacation, when we didn't have wireless or phone available.  We walked a lot and wanted to know at the end of the day how much we walked.  It would sync to the phone, tell me the number of steps being added - but then the data wasn't available!  I had to wait til I got home and got internet access for data to be available on the phone.

Also - I say the step-tracking works ""ok"" because it's not as accurate as the old (cheap) pedometer I used to use.  I've taken a walk with both, and count the steps, just for comparison.  When doing that the UP is always low.  Maybe I don't swing my arms enough - who knows!  But overall it gives me a sense of how much walking I've done in a day - so I'm fine with it as a (very expensive) pedometer.

So if you just want an easy-to-remember-to-wear pedometer, and don't mind wearing a rubber bracelet or paying a lot for it - then this product should work for you.

B00AE1TWE0,3.0,"UPDATE:  After nine months the functionality has been awesome for me and has directly contributed to tracking fitness, losing weight, and motivating more daily movement.  I've worn it every day since I bought it at the start of summer.  I track the activity and sync with MyFitnessPal since that app is easier to use as a nutrition log.  BUT, I'm on my third band now since the battery life has deteriorated on each until the band needs replacing.  I'd be interested in the bluetooth UP band, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wasn't willing to hassle with returns when it dies.  Jawbone is exemplary for sending replacement bands, but I suspect they have a lot of practice.  I'd look hard at the other fitness band options, but UP would be perfect if they'd remedy the battery failures.

***

ORIGINAL: Okay, so I nervously read all the failure reports and decided to give it a try anyway after comparing it to some of the other options.  After a month I would give it 4.5 stars, but I'll round up to 5 because it is working for me.  (I routinely wear the UP on my ankle.)

I'm at a desk or computer much of the day, so the biggest benefit for me is to plug in the band periodically and see if I've been active or not.  I was struck quickly by the variety in my activity patterns during the workweek.  Some days I would be walking a lot at work or most surprising were the days where I ended up doing very little physical movement.  I've been primarily a guy that is either actively working out/running to be fit or not doing much of anything and gaining weight.  This UP band gets me moving regularly and is a great motivator to do some activity towards the end of a day when I haven't been very active.  I'm a data person and this gives me lots of numbers.  I don't expect it to deliver a truly accurate calorie burn or precise physical activity, but it is a great place to follow relative daily activity and food intake (if you want to track nutrition.)

PROS:
- It is simple to use with my iPhone or iPad and updates across both.  It plugs into the headphone hole and works every time.
- The app is excellent for visually tracking activity, food, and sleep.
- It is pretty accurate for step count.  Probably most users do some testing to see the accuracy and my tests worked well.  I'm happy it doesn't over-count and it can be calibrated if needed.
- It fits on my ankle.  I actually don't like wearing it on my wrist during the work day, because it doesn't fit well on a long sleeve man's dress shirt.  The large size fits easily on my ankle and is where I use it during the work day, working out on the stairmaster, or running.
- Food logging is great with a bar code scan or search function.  It gives a good accounting beyond calories with sodium, fiber, fat, sugar, etc. - if I really want to track.  It is a great benefit to have a good food log on the same app as activity tracking.

CONS:
- There isn't a web portal that shows the smartphone data you've collected over time for easier analysis of health trends (like RunKeeper.)  I'm surprised by this, since the data is in the cloud as shown by how it updates across my iPhone, iPad, and even my iPod.
- The cap could be lost, but I've still got my original.  (It should come with one extra cap.)
- The search function on the food log is not stellar for restaurants or fast food, but you can generally find your meal or something close.
- Sleep function is not really intuitive, but available. Sleep tracking is not my priority, but it is interesting to see.

BOTTOM LINE:
It works for me.  If you buy the UP then you want to be a little healthier.  I'm lighter, fitter, and more active than I was a month ago and this band has been a big help and motivator.",30 days in - very positive.  9 months in - less positive.,True,
B00AE1TWE0,5.0,"I have been using this for about two months now, and it's become part of my daily routine. I knew I would love it for the sleep functions, and I wasn't let down. I feel so much more rested during the day now that I'm woken up between sleep cycles, even though I'm not entirely sure how the band determines that.

The app is one of the best-designed mobile apps out there, hands-down.

I do have a few gripes though. Sometimes the graphs show the right numbers, but the actual column size is based on data from a different category... and the daily calorie burn is too low, assuming that you don't burn any calories for the 1/3rd of the day that you're sleeping (which is definitely not the case).

Of the three bands in the family, only one had a problem--and started experiencing issues after it was soaked in water.

B00AE1TWE0,1.0,"I saw the Jawbone UP on a friend when she came over for a visit.  I thought it was jewelry at first but then saw her take it off to synch to her iPhone and the Geek in me was  curious and wanted to know more.  I had read about the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fitbit-Flex-Wireless-Activity-Sleep-Wristband-Black/dp/B00BGO0Q9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black</a>&nbsp;which I had bought a couple of times on Amazon but ended up to be on back-order (8 weeks). I didn't know that there was such a thing as the Jawbone UP so I began to research the two devices (the Fit Bit Flex and the Jawbone UP) and decided that the Jawbone was the device for me.  A quick 80 minute charge and it will last for 10 days.  Awesome!

One of the deciding factors for me was the fact that I could wear the device on my wrist to sleep and it is all one piece (besides the connection cover).  It came down to form factor between the two - I liked the look and function of the Jawbone UP band.

For the data hungry - or people like myself who are both motivated by data and enjoy it - this device is for you.  It tracks steps and sleep and does it in an elegant way with bar charts and graphs.  I can add my food and mood as well.  Just an all around great little device.

I was probably most curious about it because of it's ability to track sleep.  Deep sleep versus light sleep and getting up.

I am finding it enlightening and motivating.  It looks unobtrusive too - definitely like a funky piece of jewelry.

I just bought another for my partner.

Update September 6, 2013:  My Up band died and will no longer take a charge.  I contacted Jawbone Support and they are providing a Warranty replacement.  Downgrade the device to 3 stars because of it lack of reliability with light use.

Update December 4, 2013:  I am on my SECOND UP Band (a warranty Exchange) and this one is having problems too (will not sync with phone and the jack seems off).  I am IT fluent and work in IT, so I feel like I can speak with some amount of confidence with this product.  I believe that the hardware jack has gone bad or become disconnected in some way inside the band.  I have been in touch with Support and while they are responsive, they continually put you through iterations of reboots, power cycles, charges, etc.  After 3 times it gets a little silly.

Personally, I can NO LONGER recommend this band and wouldn't.  I love the look of it and perhaps the second Bluetooth iteration is better.  The cost makes the band prohibitive when you can now get the FitBit Flex for around $85.00.  From my research, it appears that there are a LOT of faulty Jawbone UPs out in the wild.  I can't believe I got two of them!!!",For the data hungry - a great feedback device! Faulty Hardware though!,True,3
B00AE1TWE0,2.0,"I've been using this band for the past 6 weeks and, for the most part, have been pretty happy with it. However, I was feeling like I was having to charge this thing much more often than every 10 days. I charge it whenever I'm sitting at my computer (like right now), and it charges fast...maybe 30-40 minutes? But I decided to jot down the date and time I last fully charged it though, since I tend to lose track.

Sunday, June 16th at 8am I fully charged my band to 100%. Today, 4 days later on Thursday, June 20th at 2 pm I synced my band and it said 33% 3 Days Left. Um...excuse me?? By my calculations 10 days from June 16th is June 26th. WHY, after only 4 days do I only have 33% left? This band ACTUALLY holds a full charge for about 5 DAYS...NOT 10 days. Lying to consumers and falsely doubling your products charge-hold time is pretty sleazy.

Aside from that, the band has been ok. I've had no issues with it not working, though I should mention that I do NOT wear this in the shower. I know it says it's ok to, but there's nothing I'm doing in the shower that needs to be tracked, and I felt that getting this wet every day was just an unnecessary strain on the band.

I really like the sleep tracker, though some nights I feel it's off. I'll wake up 2 or 3 times in the middle of the night and struggle to get back to sleep. In the morning when I sync, it'll say I only woke up once and was up for a total of 12 minutes when I KNOW I was up much longer than that...so accuracy has been a concern of mine since day one.

Tracking your food is helpful, but clunky with the Jawbone App. All your food goes into a 'Library', but there's no easy way of sorting through this library. And the more food you add each day, the bigger and bigger the list becomes, making it very difficult to find items you know you've scanned before (the barcode scanner is ALWAYS the easiest way to go, so if you can, just do that). However for things like salads, you have to indivudually enter in every ingredient, which becomes time consuming, so I've gotten to the point where I just don't bother half the time.

My band says I average 22,000 steps a day. I was shocked by this. I had no IDEA I moved around that much. Some days I get up to 30,000 steps. This has really made me question the accuracy. I would love to see this worn at the same time as a traditional pedometer to see how the two compare. I'm a stay-at-home-mom to a son who's in summer camp from 9 am-5 pm, 5 days a week. I go to the gym 5 days a week for an hour, but I lift weights...no running or cardio. WHERE am I getting in 30,000 steps a day?? I haven't a clue.

Overall, if you're interested in this, I say hold off for now. Wait for the next model to be released...hopefully they'll have fixed some of the bugs and updated their app (at least the food section) to be a little more 'user-friendly'. Oh, and the battery life. Maybe the next one will have an HONEST battery life estimate. SMH...10 days. Not a chance.",10 Day Battery Life Is A FLAT OUT LIE.....,False,2
B00AE1TWE0,3.0,"I like the Up for all of the reasons stated but after using it for a few weeks I am actually disappointing in the poor use of information. This is not a brand new cutting edge product. It is in it's 2nd iteration and is in a product class that has multitudes of products, so it's not like this is actual new innovation. While it is nice to gather information from the band and you entering your intake and have a nice app to display the data on and for you to analyze it doesnt really do anything useful at all with the information. There is an ""insight"" feature but it really doesnt give much insight. You should have the ability to be prompted for simple goal setting and the app should connect the calorie intake and different activities and give advice on alternative foods, activites and other such healthy lifestyle advice to help you enjoyably reach your goals. The app actually does not real connection with intake and activity or any productive projection. Based on the users stated goals and nag levels it should be teaching and prompting. Right now it just gathers and displays and overall is really just a dumb terminal, basically an advanced accelerometer manually feeding info do a app that displays the info in interesting and fun but ultimately and generally useless graphs.",Nice but needs improvement,False,

I like that it records my sleep patterns; however, based on the inaccuracy of my ""steps"", I question that accuracy as well.  If I hadn't been wearing this for the past week and a half, I would return it and buy a FitBit instead.

B00AE1TWE0,2.0,"I bought a small Jawbone Up wristband and am returning it after less than one week's use. It seems to be defective. After the first 2 nights, it failed to track my sleep the subsequent 2 nights, even though I am positive I put it in sleep mode. However, it intermittently went into sleep mode while I was exercising.

It also seemed to be highly inaccurate in measuring daytime activity. Yesterday I did not leave the house at all, as I was cleaning the house, washing dishes, laundry, etc. At the end of the day, it said I had walked over 10,000 steps. My house is not THAT big! But I felt it was equating any arm movement with stepping.

For the above problems, I could not get any customer support (no response after 2 days*), and the website documentation was too sparse to be useful.

The other problem was that I habitually kept looking at the UP band to see what time it was, except the band is not a watch.

It's too bad I have to say thumbs down on the Jawbone Up, because it's a good idea, the user interface was cute, and the sleep tracking was interesting when it worked. It just seems that this device, even though it is on version 2, is still not ready for prime time in the areas of quality, reliability, accuracy, and support.

B00AE1TWE0,1.0,"I waited a while to buy a Jawbone Up. A couple of years ago it was pulled and revamped. There where a ton of issues. So I bought a Nike fuel band. That broke twice, when I returned it I bought an Up band. Thinking now I can get one. I purchased the large band and it fits very comfortably around my wrist. There's no wireless sync and you have to remove it to sync it. It's really not that bad but it would be nice to have wireless sync. The sync button is located at the end of the broken loop. I found that its a little problem when you sleep. Because when you go to bed you have to press it to put the band to sleep. If you move around while you sleep, it's possible to press the button against the bed and wake it up so your no longer tracking your sleep. They need to allow you to schedule a regular sleep schedule I.e. 11pm to 7 am. Since I'm use to my fuel band, the app is not perfect but it works. The app does sync to other health and fitness apps such as my fitness pal, but Up only sends a calorie count. I understand that they're two different apps. But if I record my food in detail it should carry it all over to My fitness pal. Also the workout tracker is nice and it allows you to enter an exercise but I'm not really sure about its accuracy to measure distance. You enter the time elapsed and how hard you work. Then it saids you ran this far. Sometimes it's listed far less then I actually ran on my treadmill or its just had 0 distance. The app and the band work as they should. But there could be some improvements. At the end of the day I think it's a far better device then the fuel band, it does a lot more and it's $30 less then the fuel band. I would totally buy it again. 4 out 5 is because its just not perfect in every way. If your like me your buying this for the potential of what it can do.
Update Product review 7/22/2013, Failure. It's been a few short months and my band has stopped working. I've tried trouble shooting it, the soft reset and the hard reset, got my lights to come back on, but it did not take. In the last three days I've fully charged my band and once I left on the charger over night while I slept. The charge does not appear to be holding. I was very disappointed with this whole thing. I got a full refund. At this point, I wouldn't recommend that you buy a band. While I had it, I enjoyed the using it. But it I found that there where a ton of things that Jawwbone could have done better and with this failure, I can't trust that it won't happen again. Most of the time consumers don't get a 2nd chance to recover what they've lost. Thank God that Amazon is always trying to please their customer's.",Almost perfect device*** update** Failed to work*** return for a refund,True,3
B00AE1TWE0,4.0,"I haven't had the product long so bear this in mind but this is what I think so far.

Reasons I love it:
It tracks how many hours of sleep I'm getting and shows how much of it is deep versus light sleep and how quickly I fell asleep.

Tracks the number of steps you take and converts that into calories burned as well as how much time you are active versus idle and a calorie burn breakdown for those categories.

Food tracker has tons of preloaded foods and allows you to easily adjust portions and things added to preloaded foods. The portion selection is a visual and mesured quantity which really helps if you have no idea what an oz of cheese is but you know how much it looked like when you ate it. The tracker will also calculate the nutritional breakdown of your individual meals and give a summary of the nutritional breakdown of your day.

Vibrates on a schedule I can set to let me know I've been sitting at my desk too long. For office jobs this can be a plus or negative depending on how you choose to see it. If you don't like it, don't set it. It reminds me to get up and take a little walk around the office.

Love the app layout. It's pretty simple to navigate and looks similar to FB including little emoticons that show your mood throughout the day according to your selection.

Includes a workout log so that you can time your workout by simply pressing the button on the band and selecting the type of workout on the app when you sync it.

It's lightweight, unobtrusive looking, water-proof, and narrow so it doesn't make my wrist sweat much in my warm climate.

Things that could improve:

I would like to be able to set a calorie goal for the day rather than just see a tracking and have to compare it to my calories burned.

The app doesn't work with older versions of Android such as my fairly new HTC Titan. I love my phone so I'm not getting a new one for this. I can use my ipad and that works ok for me too but would prefer an app on my phone.

Startup is fairly easy once you figure it out but doesn't include much instruction. I didn't want to enter my full name on my profile, but I had to to get the band and app working.

No digital display on the band. I really liked the digital display on the Nike band, but preferred the look of the Jawbone and the sleep tracker.

Overall I really like this product. It's really a personal choice which one you select. I like seeing an overall view of my day because the visualization helps me to keep myself in check and the app helps make it easier to do it all rather than scribbling on paper and making calculations. If you are looking for something that will help you to see what your lifestyle is and to somewhat remind you to do things differently, this is definately a good investment.",Awesome Activity Tracker,True,2
B00AE1TWE0,2.0,"I have had my Jawbone Up for a week now and it is going back. Believe me, I wanted to love it.

I needed the sleep tracker and the activity monitor as I am extremely active and compete in various Mud Runs. The downside of the UP is that is does not have wireless synching. That is the absolute killer. Having to take off my iPhone every time to sync hit is a pain in the arse. I would love it to just work.

The other downside is that the sleep monitor is a pain. Having to let it know when I am going to bed and let it know when I wake up, makes no sense. I have a alarm clock for that. (at least part of it)

The Design of the UP is great. Looks great on the wrist and people ask you constantly what it does so you can educate them on the health benefits. But again, no wireless synching means a pain in the butt.

The biggest issue: No web interface.  So you get to review all of your data on your cell phone screen.  Want to enter your food log - better enjoy typing into your phone screen.  I am shocked that Jawbone has not done anything about this yet.  If you go to their forums you will see that the site is filled with un-happy users asking where the web interface is.  Even if you do not log food - one of the things you will want to see is your activity level and compare to other days and times.  Given you are restricted to your phone screen - this is not possible.

The other issue is connectivity.  The UP brags that since it does not connect via bluetooth the battery will last for 10 days.  Very good feature if you are going on a safari with no computer access, but given the fact that most people have access to a computer the trade off is not worth it.  You plug this in by pulling off a cap and sticking in the audio port.  I have had it for 2 days, synced 4 times and twice I had to unplug in and replug for my Droid to sense it.  Big deal - no, it did not ruin my day.  But if it is this sensitive after 2 days - imagine what it will be like in 30 days.  Maybe they should give users an option. I find it ironic that Jawbone made a name for themselves because they revolutionized connectivity and sound via Bluetooth and with this device they totally go the other direction.  They should have stuck with the partner that brought them to the dance.

B00AE1TWE0,1.0,"I was excited when I read about the UP by Jawbone.  Despite the disaster of their initial line, the early reviews stated that they had fixed the problems.  Unfortunately, this is just not the case.

After about two months, my UP stopped syncing and could not be charged.  I tried to reset as instructed on their web site to no avail.  My cousin has had to replace hers four times since January.

When it did work, the UP was okay.  The lack of Bluetooth makes it more cumbersome to sync than some of its rivals, and I was afraid to lose the little cap that you have to take off when you sync.

Another issue that I had was that I would often forget to switch it into sleep mode at night, making the sleep tracking functionality of limited value.  I also question the accuracy of the sleep data that it does provide.

The app works great, and after a quick calibration, i have found it to be very accurate at tracking my activity.  The app also allows you to log what you eat.  You can manually add things, or use the built in bar code scanner (which works impressively well).  The battery seems to run as advertised. I get about 10 days on a charge.  The band syncs with the phone using the headphone jack.  I've seen some reviews complain that they wish it used Bluetooth, but I do not. Bluetooth would use more battery, and there is no great value add by constant synchronization.

I am very busy and have no time for gimmicks and reading labels. Then I heard about the ""UP"" band... the reviews were not very good, returned products, syncs that did not sync, etc.
I own a Jawbone bluetooth smart phone hands free product and I am a more than happy customer with the product, so based on my past experience with the brand I decided to  give the ""UP"" band a try.
I have own the band for 2 months and so far I have lost 10 pounds (no yo-yo effect, slow but steady), I did not change my diet, except for watching the amounts I eat. I am exercising more (mainly walking and using my Nordic Track) but not more than 30 to 45 minutes per day.
The ""UP"" band worked for me, it syncs flawlessly every time (I use my Iphone to run their app), I forgot once to take it off while swimming(only once) and it continued to work fine. I am sleeping better (the algorithm for quantifying sleep and even deep sleep is flawless and accurate (sleeping is grossly underrated in our go-go society).
The Cons:
It is bulky, does not have a security lock so you can easily lose it and sleeping with the band on it is painful for the wrist (carpal tunnel somebody?).
I want to give the thing a 5 starts rating  but I can not, Jawbone is all about fitting, ergonomics and efficiency... what then happened when they design the UP band?
Would I buy it again? Most definitely but I would penalize the company with a 30 dollar penalty for dreadful ergonomics. Still money talks, ""...."" walks: 10 pounds in 2 months cannot be argued with.
Sad update after 6 months of use... the switch at the end stopped working so it is impossible to change from awake to sleep mode. The product is a good one but the ergonomics very deficient. I miss my band everyday but at  the current price replacing it is not practical.
The product needs further modifications in its design and construction.
Six Month review update... very disappointed. The idea is great, the manufacturing so poor that as other reviews mentioned, the band little by little fell apart. About 3 months from purchasing and reasonable use the switch started to malfunction, one month later it fell apart but the band continued working and syncing OK but then by 6 months later the syncing and charging stopped working.

B00AE1TWE0,1.0,"The short answer is a resounding nothing.
I've been wearing my band for 2 months now, tracking, watching, calculating, comparing, and reading.
First, if your considering a purchase here's the requirements that Jawbone just puts in the fine print:

You must have a smartphone or tablet that is COMPATIBLE, even some newer models are not compatible.
You must have their Jawbone app AND to do anything in that app, you must have an internet connection, data, wireless, something.

If you have those things covered, here's what the Jawbone UP can do:
Through movement technology, it tracks ""steps"" I'm not 100% sure what ""steps"" are but it relates to movement. If you workout, it may or may not pick up your workout, it seems to depend on the swinging of your wrist that has the band on it. The instruction don't say what steps are, you have to relate to the band, it doesn't relate to you. It doesn't tell you calories burned etc. The UP band does a poor job of replacing a heart rate monitor like Polar.
The UP band tracks sleep, how is a mystery but it does actually seem pretty accurate. I would advise that you go to the Jawbone forum and read about the sleep tracking difficulties some people have run into. For me, it's too easily kicked out of sleep mode and there is no way to edit the sleep input.
Using the app, you can track your food/calorie intake. The scanning input is good but the rest of the input functions are so poor in design and function as to render if just too cumbersome for everyday use. I could easily write a small novel on how badly the food tracking portion of the app is, it's that bad!

Since all of my disappointments are software related, it's conceivable that Jawbone fix them with updates, however, in the 2 months of my ownership, there has been only one app update and it made no noticeable improvements. The Jawbone sponsored forums are screaming for updates and fixes for months with absolutely no response from Jawbone. Just a fact that I'm pointing out.

If you read the positive, 5 star reviews on here you'll notice this trend: some of the reviewers don't even own the up, others say ""it's awesome"" ""great"", ""fantastic"" ""wondrous"" but most do not say what it does that's so awesome or great or any of those other words.

My advice: if you want a calorie burned tracker, use a polar or fitbit or something. If you want to monitor your sleep, go to a sleep center. If you are looking to track your food, use ""myfitnesspal"".

I have a Garmin watch which tracks my activities far more accurately than the Up.  Other Aps which are far less costly can track what you eat.  So the real motivation for my purchase was to track my everyday activity (when I am not purposefully working out) and my sleep.  And here is the strength of the Up band.  While I believe that its tracking of both activity and sleep may not be very accurate at times, the power of using it is that any sort of tracking encourages you to meet the goals for activity and sleep that you set.  I always wondered why I was so tired during the day until Up showed me that I wasn't getting as much sleep as I thought.  I simply wasn't going to bed right away even though in my mind I wasn't delaying getting into bed.  And I found myself walking more during the day to make the 10,000 step goal that I had set.

However, I do wish that Jawbone would elaborate about how sleep and activities are tracked so that I can better understand what it is tracking.  As a person who purchased the UP as a means to better understand myself, I find Jawbone's explanation that advanced algorithms are used to be condescending.  Like telling a child that something is too complicated for them to understand.

Technical Problems

About 6 weeks after I started using the Up band, I started having problems.  It started with waking up in the morning and pressing the button on the band to take it out of sleep mode, only to find the band completely dead even though it had a 30% charge the night before.  I charged it fully, but this happened again the next night.  Following the guide on the Jawbone website, I did a soft reset and then a hard reset.  That seemed to work for a few days, but then the Up began to loose activity during the day.  Nothing was recorded.  Then there with problems with the Up being dead in the morning.  I contacted Jawbone technical support and after a two rounds of correspondence over the course of a few days, they told me to return the band to them.

Customer Support

My correspondence with Jawbone technical support was good once my Up band began to fail, but several days would pass between when I sent my email and when they responded.  However, they were quick to ask me to return the band for a replacement which I thought was very good.

Comfort

I first purchased a medium size band based on the fitting guide which was on the Jawbone website at the time.  When it arrived, I found that the medium fit too snugly, causing the ends of the band to extend up from my wrist rather than being flush.  So, I ordered the large which was too big.  It is always slipping down on my wrist, constricting my movement and causing soreness or bouncing around which is annoying.  I wish that Jawbone had designed the band better so with articulated ends which could be closed around your wrist for a customized fit instead of assuming that everyone could be comfortable with one of three sizes.

I recommend ordering two bands if you are in between sizes so that you can try the fit of both and then return the one that is less uncomfortable.

Battery

Jawbone indicates that the battery should last about 10 days.  I usually find that I need to charge the UP band after about 6 days.  I suspect that it really depends on whether or not you have set up alerts which cause the band to vibrate, using power.  Charging the band is easy and usually takes about an hour.  However, you cant charge the band at night since it needs to be plugged in.  I usually charge it when I am at working at my desk.

Android Application

I was excited to hear that Jawbone had finally developed an ap for Android.  However, I was very disappointed by the ap once I tried it.  I installed the ap from the Play store and within 90 minutes my phone's battery had been drained significantly.  My phone never goes down in battery life that quickly.  I checked the battery meter and it was the Up ap that had used the battery power.  I uninstalled the ap and the battery drain stopped.

I emailed Jawbone to tell them my experience.  I received a response a few days later which read that the ap shouldnt do that and that I might want to check with my phone's manufacturer.  Which is complete rubbish since all of my other aps run smoothly and it was clearly the Up ap which caused the battery drain problem.

Synching

My routine is to wake up and plug the UP into my iPod to see how I slept.  I also synched when I got home from work and when I go to bed.  I found it was easy to get into the habit of switching between modes or synching.

Sleep Monitoring

I don't know how the UP determines when you are in deep sleep as opposed to light sleep.  The website just says that they use ""advanced algorithms"" to make the calculations.  For me, it would be more helpful to understand how the determination is made so that I can better understand my sleep which is part of the reason why I purchased the up.

In one instance, I received a telephone call about 30 minutes after I went to bed.  I got out of bed to answer the phone, had a brief conversation and returned to bed agitated.  However, the Up showed no indication that I was up and instead showed me sleeping.  I have the phone record so I know it wasn't a dream so I find it odd that the Up didn't pick it up, especially since I walked around before getting back to bed.

I have found that if you hit the snooze button or if you take a short nap, the UP band will not record that short nap as sleep.  I don't know what the threshold is to get the UP band to actually recognize that you are sleeping, but it seems to be that you must be sleeping longer than 20 minutes.

Activity Monitoring

The first time that I wore the UP, I hopped on my bike and rode on trails for 1 1/2 hours which included a steep uphill climb.  The UP showed it as being 7000 steps.  The UP isn't like a GPS watch to keep track of distance, nor does it have any way to measure cadence.  So, I wonder how it calculated the steps.  Again, the secret is the ""advanced algorithms""

Today for example, I went for a quick 36 minute run which I tracked using my Garmin watch.  However, UP shows that my longest activity today was only 23 minutes.  I could understand if UP didn't get an accurate indication of my bike rides but to miss active time when I was running?

I wish that you could import exercise data without having to enter it manually.  I use a Garmin watch to keep track of my exercise and the Garmin website can output data files of my activity.  It would have been nice to be able to import the data into the Up application so that I can keep all of my data in one place on the UP.

Activity Alarms

You can set activity alarms so that the Up vibrates if you sit in one place for too long.  However, it seems that the UP requires a certain number of steps or else it will tell you that you should be moving.  For example, I will be on my feet at work and moving back and forth between desks.  In another case, I will get up from my desk to go to the kitchen down the hall and on the way back, the UP will vibrate.  I appreciate the reminders to move but I do find the alerts to be annoying when they occur when I am moving.

Application

There are tips on each day.  During my second week of use, I got a tip that I didn't sleep deeply enough and that I should consider exercising more.  Seeing as I exceed 10,000 steps a day, usually by 10,000 steps including an hour running or biking each day with more on weekends, I found this tip to be really annoying.  It is as if the programmers set UP to look at one statistic without regard for others.  I bought UP to look at the whole picture.  That UP doesnt is a real failure in my opinion.

Diet

It is possible to record what you eat during the day.  One option is to scan barcodes.  However, as someone who makes most of my own food including bread and pasta from scratch, it is difficult for me to figure out the nutritional values that the ap asks me for.  So this feature is much more readily useful for someone that eats out in places where others have already eaten and entered the nutritional information or someone who eats a lot of microwave dinners.  So overall, this feature was a real disappointment for me.

Summary

Overall, a powerful tool for tracking and therefore improving your daily activity and sleep.  However, don't expect a lot from the other functions of the Up ap such as tracking your nutritional intake.  My first Up band had technical problems and had to be returned, but I still plan to purchase a replacement.","Just a fad or a helpful device?  Maybe a bit of both, but mine stopped working after two months",True,15
B00AE1TWE0,3.0,"I've read some bad reviews on the UP, but mine seems to be working OK so far. I'm concerned about it's water resistance, shock absorption and the ability to decontaminate it. So having said that, if you want an expensive pedometer and you don't work/play anywhere were it would take a hard blow, be submerged for periods of time or get blood/body fluids on it, I would say you'll enjoy it.",It's Okay.,True,
B00AE1TWE0,2.0,"Judging by the reviews, I am probably current record holder for longest lasting up band at 9 joyful months of tracking. But then everything changed when the battery drained in about two days and refused to charge. Never in my life have I wanted to see a product succeed so badly. Great piece of tech, just wish it wasn't so darn easy to kill. Gonna be lonely running without my up band on my wrist.","Was so exited, worked great for 9 months then battery failed.",True,
B00AE1TWE0,1.0,"I have never felt a need to write a negative review more than I have for this product. This has just been an awful experience for me, to the point where I will never own another Jawbone product. Even if one was given to me as a gift, I'd throw it out.

I've gone through multiple Gen 2 Up bands. The reason being is after 6 weeks, they just stop working. There is no gradual decline or indication that it will die. They just die. I've gone through the RMA process, where they will make you do multiple resets of the device and then will send you a replacement after you send them back the broken band. The new one will come, work OK for awhile (notice that I didn't say ""well""), and then like clockwork, at about the 6 week mark, it just stops working.

When the band was working, my results fluxuate between extremely precise to so inaccurate I don't know what it's doing. It wasn't uncommon for it to just disappear during workout mode. I'd have a 45 minute workout, and there would be a 15 minute window in the middle of it where it didn't record anything, even though my movements were identical before and after the blackout.

If you call Jawbone about this, they'll tell you it's you, and you should do a soft reset of the device.

The sleep mode is nowhere near accurate, especially when I compared it with a Lark. It'll have me in a deep sleep when I'm in bed, reading a book, may even get up and get a glass of water, so there is plenty of movement. It doesn't detect this, I'm in deep sleep. However, when I am asleep, I get lots of awake time and footsteps captured. I'm pretty sure I'm not sleep walking to the extent of 1500 steps.

If you call Jawbone about this, they'll tell you it's you, and you should do a soft reset of the device.

There is a calibration feature that is supposed to make the device more accurate. So I got on the treadmill and walked exactly 1/2 mile so I could use that to calibrate. The band detected that I walked much greater than that, and when I was able to ""adjust"" the distance for the walk, the lowest option they offered was 1.2 miles. Yet the number of steps it counted was pretty close to what I was counting in my head. It must think that I am 9 feet tall and my strides cover a great distance.

I didn't bother calling Jawbone about this. By this point, I know they are of no help.

I had a band that wouldn't even accept a soft or hard reset. I tried this on one before I called, knowing they would tell me to.

If you call Jawbone about this, they tell you that nobody else has experienced this, but they will begrudingly replace it. Yet their forums are full of people who have this exact issue.

After my most recent band started vibrating and wouldn't stop until the battery died, I've decided I had enough. There isn't anything out there yet that tracks movements, sleep, and provides an awesome workout and food journal really well, but that doesn't mean any of us should settle for a product that is so flawed that I spend more time on the phone with customer support than I do analyzing the data it gathered.

Here's to hoping that Fitbit Flex is a little better when it makes it to market.",Do Not Buy! Product is seriously flawed,False,172
B00AE1TWE0,3.0,"So, if you are looking for a really cool / expensive bracelet.... Ask yourself, what do you expect to get from this device? For me it is about sleep and exercise (calories burned). Regarding exercise, UP does about as good a job as any of the other pedometers, etc. like Fitbug (albeit more convenient as a wrist band than as a token device that you need to carry in your pocket). From a sleep perspective, I'm most interested in the quality of my sleep. UP leverages tech called Wrist Actigraphy (layman's term -- how much you're moving your arm around while you sleep). A little research shows that Actigraphy can be reasonably effective at giving you an indication of your sleep patterns, in particular, the 'variability (e.g. night-to-night) of your sleep. Also, if you want to understand the potential impact certain drugs, CPAP and other items might have on your sleep patters, then Actigraphy might help. I'm not convinced, at all, that this device can determine the quality of my sleep. For example, it claims to be able to determine how much ""deep sleep"" I'm getting (c.r. layman's term - SWS - Slow Wave Sleep / non-REM or deep sleep). Without an EEG and other measures (EEG, O2 sat, respiration) I'm not sure how they can determine that. So, in summary, I think this is a nice novelty. May help you determine if you are having interrupted sleep, and will certainly help you track your activity. Aside from that, it now sits on my dresser.",UP is a DOWNER - Maybe,True,

B00AE1TWE0,1.0,"I got the 2nd generation UP band for Christmas and LOVED it. It was amazing and I lost 7 pounds just by tracking my steps and food. Unfortunately, 3 weeks later, it stopped logging data. I'd plug the band in, it said it was synchronizing data, but then no data would appear. I logged a service request on the Jawbone website, and after a day did not hear anything back. So, I put a complaint on their Facebook page. After that, I got simultaneous instructions (from both Jawbone customer service and the Facebook page) instructing on how to do a Soft Reset. I tried to do it at least 20 times but it did not work. So, I sent an email back telling them so. More than a day later, I got another email telling me how to do a Hard Reset, which erases all the data and makes the band ""like new"" again. That approach worked great! For all of 5 minutes, then it stopped logging data again. But, it did manage to waste another day & a half in my wait to get a replacement. After finally getting someone on the phone, she cheerfully agreed that I needed a new one and they would send me a return postage label ""soon."" TWO DAYS LATER, I called them again to find out what exactly ""soon"" means to them (answer: 48-72 hours before they can send a label, no reason given why that should be). All told, it took approximately 2 weeks to get a replacement band, after the first one had only worked for 3 weeks. It didn't work for almost as long as it worked.

The 2nd band never worked properly at all. Every time I tried to plug it in, it would drain power instead of charging. I tried all different outlets in the house, several computers, everything I could think of. Finally, the only thing that worked was doing a Soft Reset on the band every single time I wanted to charge it. This is not supposed to be how it works, but I had such a bad experience with customer service that I was willing to work around it. Unfortunately, now it has completely stopped logging data, just like the last band. It doesn't work. They both didn't work. It is garbage.

It was awesome the first time around, I loved using it and was so motivated. I told everyone I knew how great it was. But after the first time it broke, my motivation broke right along with it. After waiting 2 weeks to get a new one, I was no longer excited to get my 10,000 steps and I only logged my food on good days. I didn't check the charts anymore. I felt like it could quit on my anytime so I didn't want to rely on it too much. Ironically, this week I was finally getting back into a good routine with more exercise and tracking my nutrition, so of course now it breaks again. I'm so disappointed and frustrated. I loved it when it worked but I can't recommend this to anyone. They don't have the bugs worked out of it yet. They can't make one that works reliably. Apparently the 1st Gen worked even worse than the one I have, but I can tell you for certain that the 2nd Gen is not there yet either. Do not buy this. You will be disappointed.","Great product, when it works! Which is never!",False,6
B00AE1TWE0,5.0,"I have been attached to my regular pedometer for a while, but liked the idea of one on my wrist.  This seems very accurate for a step tracker.  Hard to tell how accurate it is for sleep - it will show how much light and deep sleep you have - since I am asleep at the time, but it also tracks the number of times you wake up and when - this seems accurate.  The things I like:
 - Unobtrusive
 - easy to use
 - tracks sleep (and based on this info, I have made adjustments to improve sleep)
 - can track food (I do not)
 - can track your mood (up to you - kind of fun)
 - it vibrates if you have not moved (must be a set number of steps) in 30 minutes (or whatever number of minutes you set it to) - since I sit at my desk quite a bit this is a good reminder
 - you can set it to be an alarm that will wake you within a predetermined time span - nice feature
 - you can also set it to wake you at the end of a ""power nap"" - I have not used this feature

Things I do not like as much
 - It can get in the way a little while working on the computer - not a big deal
 - It does not track steps for biking (fix for this is to put it on your ankle :-) )
 - the battery does not seem to last as long as it is supposed to - probably around 6 days

B00AE1TWE0,3.0,"So I bought this thing because it's a cool bit of wearable tech and my application for Google Glass looks like it's not going through.  I had hoped it would be amazing.  It's not.  It's just ""OK"".  It seems to monitor my steps perfectly which is great.  The problem is I can't just look at it and see where I'm at.  I have to uncap the thing and stick it into my phone.

Then again my phone has an app that monitors my steps.  I also have a pedometer that has my steps on a little LCD display.  Both work just as well and both are much less money.

Sooo... what else has this thing got going for it?  Well it gives you a zap when it thinks you should get off your fat ass and take the dog for a walk.  That's nice.  But if it wants to get me moving it's going to need a lot more voltage.  Still, it's a gentle nudge in the right direction.

What else?  Oh ya... you can take pictures of your food then spend endless hours trying to figure out how to add the calorie count into the on-phone app.  Then find you have made an error and spend a lot more time trying to figure out how to remove the food or edit your posting.

You have a bit more luck if you can scan a bar code.  But most of my food doesn't come with a bar code.  What are the Jawbone guys eating - space station MRE frozen rations or something?

There's also lot of ""popular"" foods.  Wow... popular with complete junk food junkies I guess.  None of my favorites are on there.

But eventually it will learn all the things you eat.  So if you stick at it you can eventually get a decent recording of your caloric intake.  Now what?  How about getting a nice graph or some sort of indication of your progress or some suggestions on what to cut out at the end of the month?  Or something?  Anything?  Well if it does that there's certainly no indication I can see.

Edit:  Ok... there's a TRENDS option and it does show graphs.  Could do more in that area but it's not totally lacking.  Sorry Jawbone!

B00AE1TWE0,1.0,"//Update

My second Jawbone UP has stopped working just a little over 90 days after getting it. Save your money folks, this product is not ready for prime time.

//original review follows:

I purchased a black onyx size large Jawbone UP the week they became available.  At the time they were only available at Apple stores.  I had been waiting for the re-design as I had narrowly avoided getting the 1st iteration of the UP which was ultimately plagued with major reliability issues, resulting in Jawbone issuing a statement that the release of that product had been an inadvertent beta program.

I have wanted a fitness tracker for a while, and had looked at the Fitbit, Nike Fuelband and others before deciding that the UP seemed to offer the fewest compromises for what I am after.... a fitness tracker that is water resistant, that will track sleep habits and that I ""wear"" so that I won't lose it.

I got my UP on release week at a local Apple store.  I guessed at the size, but the Large size fits me pretty well.  Interestingly the bracelet was initially somewhat snug but loosened up after a couple of days of regular wear.  Setting it up with my iPhone was very easy.  I simply downloaded the application onto my phone, disconnected the cap on the UP and plugged it into the headphone jack of my iPhone.  I ran through the setup fairly quickly and was up and running.

As a pedometer, the UP works fairly well.  Step counting and distance traveled is reasonably accurate although it is unfortunate that it can't track elevation changes, such as how many stairs you have climbed, or if you are climbing a mountain.  As a result of this, you can be rapidly hiking a steep hill, breathing hard and sweating a ton, but since UP only looks at how quickly you are covering ground it will report that you've been undertaking a ""light"" activity.  Ha!

On the subject of activities.  UP gives you the ability to time an activity through a key sequence with the single button on the wristband, but I found the feature lacking.  In bright Colorado sun it was impossible to see the flashing light that tells you if an activity has started, and as a result, on at least a couple of occasions I had not activated the ""timed activity mode"" properly, instead putting the wristband into ""night/sleep"" mode.  It would be nice if they used a brighter LED or a vibration sequence for activity begin and a different one for activity end so that you could be a little more confident that it's tracking what you want.

UP also gives you the ability to manually enter an activity, such as aerobics, weight lifting, elliptical machine, etc.  The list is pretty comprehensive, but I found that the calorie counts it came up with didn't match up with what my Precor reported.  You can slide your finger up and down on the activity to rate the difficulty of the workout, and UP will roughly adjust the calorie count, but it would be nice to simply  input the calories, in the event you are using a piece of gym equipment that gives you a more precise number.

UP lets you set goals for ""moving"" and ""sleeping"" and then tells you if you've hit those goals when you sync the wristband up.  Unfortunately it does not add the equivalent ""move"" benefit from your inputted activities, so if you've sat on your butt most of the day, but then finished out the afternoon with a grueling 90 minutes on the elliptical machine, UP will still show that you've not hit your move goal.

The UP does now have the ability to post your workouts or activities via Twitter and Facebook which is a step in the right direction.  Originally it could not do that, which was disappointing.  It also has a ""calorie tracker"" that you can use to input your meals, but unless you know the calorie count of everything you eat (or everything you eat comes from one of a select number of fast food joints or coffee shops) it seems like a bit of a gimmick to me.

What the UP does that is useful is give you a good idea of how much you've moved around in a day.... so, for me, it's a good way to prioritize workouts.  If I move 10,000-12,000 steps in a day then I might feel less guilty about putting a workout off.  If I've moved well under the goal value then I know I really need the extra gym time.  The sleep tracking is somewhat useful but I don't know that I believe the UP, as at times I've woken up and been awake for a few minutes, and UP never notices this.  It is handy for telling me how long it takes to get to sleep, it would be nice to be able to export that kind of data over an entire month... something you can't do with UP today.

I had my first UP for just two months when it started to act funny.  It was having trouble syncing, and one night when I switched it in to night mode it sort of gave a feeble buzz and died.  It was completely dead and nothing Jawbone support had me try could bring it back.  This was VERY disappointing to me as this is reminiscent of what users were reporting with the first generation product.  In my case, although I had showered and washed my hands with the ""water resistant"" UP (which they say is fine), I had never abused it or done anything unusual to it.  About the worst abuse that it got was getting snagged and twisted on a pillow or sheet when I moved around while sleeping or when slipping a jacket on.

Another thing that I had noticed with my UP is that after just the two months of use the bracelet was starting to look somewhat worn out.  Some kind of plastic film was peeling away from the band and the cap looked like it had been run over with a truck.... the finish was being worn away just by the sweat of my fingers removing and reseating it... leaving cheap looking plastic showing through.

It took about a full 2-3 weeks for me to get my replacement UP.  Unfortunately you must mail the defective one back at your own expense (sans any accessories) and wait on their RMA department to ship you a replacement.  I'm still using it but I'm not optimistic about the lifespan of these guys.  I got in just under the wire with the warranty too.  You'd think that with the poor reputation the first revision had that Jawbone would have bumped it up on these new ones, especially considering the roughly 30% price bump they applied to the MSRP.

Considering the increase in MSRP you'd think that they would have given it a solid 1 year warranty, or included a spare cap (you're sure to lose the original one and they want an insane $10 for a replacement), or given it bluetooth.

I'm not sure if I would be happier with Fitbit or Fuelband either... as mediocre as it is, the UP is still probably the best fit for me, at least until someone (Apple?) develops a smart watch that has all of the functionality of the UP built in, obsoleting the sucker.

The way I look at it, these devices today are just scratching the surface of what is possible with biometric tracking and the next generation or two of these devices will make us glad that we had to pitch these ones in the trash can after a short time.","Fragile, just like the first Jawbone UP!

The food intake tracking a complete joke-nothing like myfitnesspal and filled with inaccurate information.  Never did figure out how to delete a food or change it.  The steps or movement tracking was insightful but not as much as I had hoped.  The workout log was just useless.  Its not like it tracks your heart rate or take in account your build or weight so how do you REALLY know how many calories you are burning.  Plus you have to remember when to log the workout and you cannot do it before the present time.  So you have to remember after your workout to log it.  I did like the Idle Alert.  I did find it useful and it got me to realize how long I sit at work and reminded me to get up once in awhile.  I never used the nap but found the alarm to be HORRIBLE.  It is supposed to wake you up when it thinks its the best time-NOT the time you actually set it for.  So I was being woken up about 20 mins BEFORE I actually wanted to-from a deep sleep!  And the annoying shock treatment way it wake you is not pleasant!  The band itself was cumbersome and got snagged on everything I wore.  I work at a computer all day using keyboard commands and a mouse and it was really getting in the way.  The lack of bluetooth is annoying and when I needed to sync it, I had to take the cases off my iPhone and iPad in order to get it to sync properly.  The charger is super short.  I had to hang in mid air off the cord.  And that little plug is going to get lost.

I can see how perhaps the person just trying to get fit and get a basic handle on things would find it useful but for those of us who really want to track our fitness, this is NOT the band to get.  This isn't anything more than a glorified pedometer (an inaccurate one at that).  Jawbone customer service was EXCELLENT though, even after I decided to return it.","If your an athlete or serious about fitness, buy something else!",False,
B00AE1TWE0,5.0,"Did not charge, unable to use it, could have been a good product, but it just not worked at all.

UPDATE

Amazon promptly sent a new unit that, up to now is working fine. It passed the first recharge test and is giving accurate information. Hope stays that way.

I give now 3 stars; I'll wait at least a month for the definitive rating.

Update: After about two months my unit is working fine.

It's an excellent motivator to move and to control your foof intake.

I started with a goal of 3,000 steps/day, now my goal is 7,000/day, and some days I reach 10,000/day

Agree with other reviewers that it lacks the ability to measure steps while pushing a cart or bicyclying or swimming, but was aware of that",Excellent motivator to move,True,
B00AE1TWE0,2.0,"I watched the Up during the first generation, and appreciated Jawbone's concern for customer satisfaction evidenced by their pulling the product and giving refunds. I was optimistic when I saw the feedback regarding this latest comments. I decided to buy and that's where my hopefulness ended.

First, I have to say that I have not calibrated the Up yet. But that shouldn't impact my observations. I walked 98 steps and used that as my constant. I took the same 98 steps 6 more times with a range of 43-102. I then tried it with my periodic 273 step break. The first time it registered 242 steps. The second time, it registered 437 steps. Now to the sleep monitoring: the worst was last night when I was up seven times between 9:30p and 7:43a (I was sick). However, the Up registered me awake only three times. Each of the seven times I awoke, I got out of bed and left the room.

Needless to say, I'm not confident in the results I am getting. I know I need to calibrate the device. But I don't think that will solve the issues of variability and poor sleep data.",Struggling,True,3
B00AE1TWE0,5.0,"This is an amazing little device.  It's extremely lightweight and comfortable.  It does NOT change in shape and size.  I have a 7"" wrist and the medium fits perfectly and stays secure on my wrist.

Out of the box, I used my GPS and ran 6.2 miles.  The UP registered that I had run 8.2 miles.  I used this run as a calibration.  Since calibrating the device, it hasn't been off by more than 1/10th of a mile for every 10 miles run.  It really will only work with step workouts, but if you're a runner that's what you really need anyway.  There are multiple options for other exercises.  However, I tried it on the rowing machine and realized quickly the best way to log that workout is manually.

As far as the sleep function goes, it is simply amazing.  There are almost certainly better sleep trackers in a hospital, but sleeping with electrodes all over you isn't really feasible.  I tested this function by examining how I felt for the first two hours after sleep BEFORE syncing the device and altering my assessment.  In nearly every case over the course of three weeks, the amount of sleep/deep sleep/ and times woke up corresponded directly with how tired I had rated myself as being.

The waterproof claim is great so far.  I sweat like a pig when I run and have had no problems with sweat ruining the device.  I wash my hands while wearing it constantly and again, no problems.  Additionally, I have showered in it a couple times, also without problems. The problems since the 1st gen mostly seem to be fixed.  I haven't had any problems with the cap falling off, the waterproof claim seems valid, and I haven't had any malfunctions with the device.

The food logging aspect is the only area that I think needs some work.  The scan, picture, or manually search and enter functions are all there and easy to use but it seems to take me more time than an old app I was using where everything was manual search and enter.

Overall, if you're dedicated to regularly wearing the device (you'll barely notice it after a day or so), if you're really going to examine your life and make changes, and if you're willing to calibrate the device, there is nothing out there that's better to track your lifestyle.

Final note - there have been a lot of complaints about this not syncing wirelessly.  For me, the plug and synce feature is awesome.  I don't carry my phone with me all the time and this will record data until you're near your phone again and able to sync.  It also means that you can go for a little more than a week between charges on the UP.  It also means that you won't be charging your iPhone three times a day in order to compensate for constant wireless syncing.

AWESOME GADGET!","Amazing device, especially after a good calibration.",False,56
B00AE1TWE0,5.0,"I have been using the UP band for about 5 weeks now and I find it very useful for tracking my steps and also my sleep patterns. The battery life on the device is great since I can get at least 7 days without recharging. The UP has a great feature that you can set a reminder to get up periodically if you haven't moved in awhile. The default is 15 minutes but I changed mine to 30 minutes because sometimes you're in meetings. Some people might find that syncing through the headphone jack is cumbersome but I think it is more reliable than Bluetooth (will explain later). I do not really use the food portion of the app because it is a bit cumbersome to either take a picture of your food or manually type it in. As for the UP's competition, I did try the FitBit and had a rather bad experience since it would not sync consistently over Bluetooth and that seemed to drain the battery quite quickly. In addition, I lost my FitBit after 2 weeks since it fell off of my belt. Therefore I like the design of the UP since it is on your wrist. I would highly recommend if you want an easy way to monitor your health in 2013!",Great for tracking steps and sleep! Also tried the FitBit but did not like as much,False,6
B00AE1TWE0,5.0,"I've been using the Up for a month now and I like it. It fits well, has a nice accompanying app, and looks good while wearing it. I have tried the Nike Fuelband and a couple of Fitbits (the Ultra and the Zip) and they're not as good as the Up, IMHO. The Fuelband was too thick (noticable when trying to write with a pen or pencil as it elevated my wrist too high off the table) and it was too loose (but if i had bought the next smaller one it would've never clasped onto my wrist). Sizing is a little more flexible with the Up. I am right between sizes with both the Fuelband and the Up and they both tell you to choose the next bigger size, if that's the case. However, after having read that the Up ""stretches out"" a bit over time I decided to go with the smaller size and it has worked perfectly for me (I did try the bigger size also and it was too loose). Compared to my Fitbit I have noticed that the Up shorts me about 1000 steps (about half a mile) per day but I can live with that (I lowered my daily goal by the same amount to compensate). I don't mind having to plug it into my phone to sync and the battery lasts a lot longer than the Fuelband or Larklife because of the lack of Bluetooth (remember, everything in life is a compromise). If the Larklife weren't so garishly colored and so big I might've preferred that but the Up offers most of the same features and then some (I don't believe the Larklife has the ""smart alarm"" feature, which determines the best time to wake you up within 30 minutes of your set time, based on when you're in the lightest phase of sleep) in a smaller and more fashionable package.",Better than Fuelband and Fitbit,False,5

B00BCQ0YG6,5.0,"The NuBall Bowling Ball Rejuvenator does a fantastic job at extracting oil from bowling balls. Both of my bowling balls (Storm IQ Tour Pearl and Storm Lights Out), which I've owned for 2 years, were never baked in a bowling ball oven prior to trying this device (but I do clean them with a degreaser after each bowling session). I'd venture to say that both of my balls had at least 70+ games of use on them prior to putting them in the rejuvenator (I bowl in a league). I ran each ball through the rejuvenator for approximately 1 hour at 135 degrees. After an hour, the tray had collected a decent amount of oil (about two tablespoons per ball). Since extracting the oil, I've noticed that my balls are hooking more -- like they're brand new again. While most professional would highly recommend against baking your bowling ball too often, I couldn't resist my urge to put it back into the oven after bowling about 10 games: The result was very lackluster: There was no oil in the collection tray (which is likely because the amount of oil on the ball after 10 games was so miniscule that it evaporated during the process).",Very Useful Tool,False,

B00BD57RZW,4.0,"As a Cold Steel and Mora fan this one tickled my fancy. I love everything about this design for camp use and EDC fixed blade use.

The thing I disliked most actually worked out perfect for this application, the bag a 3V Posse has a few molle loops on the right side this ""ugly ass"" sheath slides perfectly under and the clip holds this solid on the bag. Now I would love a molle compatible kydex for this but you can't have it all at this price point. However Kabar makes a up to 7"" better sheath for $12 the this fits in. OK, this came shaving sharp and the retention in the plastic sheath is very good. The blade steel really has not had its day of abuse yet, no ""batoning"" or stump stabbing like you see on youtube. I suspect I could snap the tip or chip the edge with intent but this one will be light duty for the most part unless needed, I know the limits of stainless blades and have broken a few (say hello Buck). As so far the Peace Maker II grips really well has the length and full tang I wanted (once again sweet design), and if I lose or break it later no tears will be shed unless I can't buy another for this reasonable price.",I love everything about this design for camp use and EDC ...,True,

I got it to put on some backup gear and ended up dressing out a deer, using it for bushcraft and a bunch of tasks in the yard, mainly because it was the first thing I happened upon.

B00BD57RZW,5.0,"This is probably the best ""budget"" belt knife that I know of.
It has a ""5 1/2"" long""!!!!!!!! x 1 1/8"" wide x 3 mm thick blade.
It uses German 4116 stainless steel that is razor sharp and very durable. It is NOT ""super steel"", but more than adequate.
It uses the same blade grind as the Mora 2000 (~$30) and Mora Forest (~$28) both have only ~4"" blades and are not as well suited for defensive uses.
The tip is ground for ""slicing"" i.e. food or flesh/meat.
The portion next to the handle is designed for carving, notching wood, etc..
It uses a double finger guard or hilt for hand/finger protection while ""stabbing"" or thrusting.
The spine is 90 and strikes a ferro rod very well.
I have batoned 3-4 inch Pine and Oak logs with no problem, just as a ""test"" of the knife's capability. (Not recommended).
I have also ""cross"" batoned through the same with no problems. (again, Not recommended)
The sheath is a hard plastic, ambidextrous, with good retention and a very strong stainless steel belt clip.
(Mine weighs ~6.63 oz. / 188 grams total - knife and sheath when modified. This is for a 5 1/2"" bladed knife!!!)
I own more than a half a dozen of these things. I keep them all over the place. They are inexpensive, tough, durable and take a wicked razor edge. They are perfect for all around camp use and personal defense. I think it is a little to big for every day carry??? It was designed as a ""boot"" knife for concealed carry, so the profile is very slender. There is a smaller version Peace Maker III.

This is not a military grade knife. Civilian, yes! (IMO)

Now the ""Mods"".....
(These steps are harder to describe than do! Anybody can do this with ""stuff"" you already have around the house. You don't have to use paracord. Paracord is very common in many circles and is easy to use. The cordage just needs to ""fit"" into the belt clip. It needs to securely hold a 6 oz knife, not an elephant. You can use any ""strong"" cordage, string, twine, bakers twine, mason line, etc.......)

1) Use a pair of strong scissors to cut the ""flaps"", straight across, off of the sheath.
- Cut the back flap off just above the belt clip.
- Cut the front flap off, leaving 1 1/2"" of material.
- Trim the sharp corners off with toenail clipper and file smooth (Its plastic. Finger nail file works perfect).
- Take a pair of pliers and gently bend 1/8"" of the front flaps ""edge"" out. This creates a ""chamfer"" and allows easier insertion of the blade.
- Do the same thing to the back ""corners"" by the belt clip.

When you do this, the knife will come out of the sheath very fast and you will NOT have to re-purchase your hand or grip!!!!
You are now using 3 fingers (i.e. middle, ring and pinky) to pull out the knife. The thumb an index finger will fall ""exactly"" in place.
The retention of the blade in the sheath remains the same! You can now clip it on your belt or pocket. Because it is ""ambidextrous"" you can clip it in your pocket. (where legal!!!)

2) I have two suggestions for ""truly"" (field tested) secure belt carry:
a) Tie about 24"" of paracord into a ""loop"" (circle).

Paracord Planet 550 Cord Type III 7 Strand Paracord 100 Foot Hank - Black
(You choose the color)

I use the ""Double Fisherman's"" knot (YouTube). You only need to use two loops instead of 4 or 5.
Pull it tight to make your ""circle"".
Note: Once this knot is tight, you will have to cut it if you want to take it apart!
This makes a very strong, yet small knot. Cut and melt the ends.
Double loop it and place it into the sheath belt clip.
Now, you can insert your 1 1/2"" belt through the two loops keeping the knot on the outside of your belt. Then clip the knife sheath on to your pants pocket. This is a very stable system of carry! After a while the knife is so light you will not know it is there. You can stand, squat, sit with NO problems at all. You will NOT loose your knife if the clip comes off of your pocket, the paracord will keep it ""dangling"" off of your belt. You will have to experiment with the length of your paracord to get the right ""fit"". This allows for ""lightning"" draw of the knife!!!
It draws out like the old ""Gunslingers"" of days gone past .......NO BS!!!

b) Same idea except use a 5/8"" ""D"" ring and 5/8"" Nylon Strap. Make a belt loop. Adjust length as needed. Sew, snap or rivet the strap to the D ring (flat side of d ring goes into the belt clip). Etc...etc...

50 - Country Brook Design 5/8 Inch Welded D-Rings

I prefer the simplicity of the paracord method.
There are many ways you can tie the paracord to create the belt loop. This is just a suggestion. The whole point is to create a method that will prevent the loss of the knife in the bush.
The strap method ""looks"" better?

3) Tie 1/8"" shock cord around the belt loop and the pommel of the knife. I ""trap"" the cord by tying a knot between the clip and the fisherman's knot. Once on the handle this will prevent the knife itself from coming out of the sheath. Leave about a 2 1/2"" ""tail"" with a knot on the shock cord so that you can just pull ""straight up"" and the cord will just glide off of the handle.

Shock Cord - BLACK 1/8"" x 100 ft. Spool. Marine Grade, with 2 Carabiners & Knot Tying eBook. Also called Bungee Cord, Stretch Cord & Elastic Cord.
(You can find it cheaper. This is just for information. The ""Marine Grade"" is really good.)

4) I tape the handle for a better ""feel"". I use 1/2"" BLACK Crepe masking tape with a spiral wrap, about 1/16"" overlaps. Then finish"" off with two wraps of 3/4"" tape at the pommel and hilt (only), this is for added durability.

I have been using these knives for years.
The 4116 steel will dull quite quickly, like most knives, with extensive use on cardboard or sisal rope. Simply ""stropping"" the blade will bring the edge back very easily.

Update tip chipped a bit but still drives in deep, however this is no bueno since its stabbing power has been greatly reduced, the sharp parts of the blade have chipped off when it bounced across small rocks after bouncing off the target.

blade: stiff, not ""flimsy"" as some reviewers said. thicker than I thought it'd be and sharpens up very easily to razor status. accidentally dropped it point first into the carpet. sank right through and bent the needle-like tip. bent back into place pretty quick with one stroke of a triangle file. good as new.

The difference between the two is size, with this being the larger of the two.
They are an outstanding choice for a fixed blade knife, but don;t for a minute think because they are marketed as a ""boot knife"" that they don't excel at wood working, and general use, because they do.
Some may snub their nose at the 4116 Krupp steel, but I have never had a problem with it, and for value, and keeping the cost down, I like it.
This knife has a unique blade design that makes it good for self defense as well as a scani-grind for an easy to sharpen usefulness.

1) The handle is very boxy, and squared off. However, this also gives it a low-profile as a boot knife. The lanyard hole (and why would you want that in a boot knife?) shows that this is probably a full tang knife.
2) The clip on the sheath is tighter than any knife I know! Which is a good thing if it's in your boot!

B00BD57RZW,3.0,"The knife is a good one for the price. It's sharp, fits the hand well, and WOULD carry comfortably and unobtrusively if it didn't have that ridiculous (and also quite flimsy) boot sheath. Really now, very few people carry knives clipped to their boots.  But many have a need for a sharp, rugged, medium sized, yet light weight belt knife just like this one---but need a decent sheath to carry it.  Yes, the clip can be attached to thinner belts, but not very securely.  A nice, basic cordura sheath would be ideal and shouldn't add more than a few bucks to the price.  I did get a decent 5"" nylon sheath that fits all right, but a buyer shouldn't have to do that.  I could never understand why companies produce a good product with real sales potential and then sabotage it with penny wise, pound foolish practices.  I've been a Cold Steel fan for years.  They usually produce quality products at competitive prices, so I'm surprised as well as disappointed.  I haven't used mine seriously up to this point so I can't say how the edge holds or re-sharpens.  The knife seems to be ideal for outdoor utility use or as an emergency weapon.  But most buyers wishing to make practical use of it should budget another $10 or so for a replacement sheath.",Very good knife.  Lousy sheath.,True,6.0
B00BD57RZW,3.0,"Steel is a bit soft, requiring frequent re sharpening. The sheath is an ok design for the boot, but not for wearing anywhere else. It is also kinda big.

B00BD57RZW,5.0,"I am very pleased with this knife. Cold Steel has a reputation for their exceptional knives, and this is no disappointment. I am a backpacker, and love the outdoors. This is an excellent knife for both bushcraft and self-defense. Many blades designed for bushcraft don't lend themselves to self-defense because of their smaller size, and most self-self-defense knives are far too beefy for the smaller tasks involved in bushcraft. The Peace Maker II gives the best of both worlds. The grip is perfect for left or right hand use, and when wet, there is no slippage. Out of the box, this knife was razor sharp, and the sheath fit snugly. Overall, this knife will perform every task it was designed to perform. To address some people's concerns; Cold Steel is an American manufacturer with distribution and offices located in several places. While the country of  assembly may be Taiwan, the steel is still American in origin and make. Many American companies do this, and there is no drop in quality. Also, many people buy a knife expecting it to do things it isn't made to do. You can't buy a 3.5 inch blade and expect it to become a hatchet or fighting blade. Buy a knife specifically made for what you intend to do. I don't expect to be taking down a 900 lb bear with a 5 inch knife.

B00BD57RZW,5.0,"Surprisingly good it's not, as just about everything that I have ever purchased from Cold Steel has been sharp, and keeps an edge... what's amazing is the light weight and the sheath, which allows a reasonable boot carry. It's good for backup, as in ""the left handed knife"", and a good one for the side of my bug out bag, blackpowder possibles bag, and concealed on my weak side, with my pistol on the other to balance it out.  The Mora ""Light My Fire"" is fantastic must have blade in and of itself as it's a good small blade w firestarter in the handle, but it's not a fighting knife. This PeaceMaker is a good fighter, and with the addition of a good secondary fire starter rod you would have it all.  Quick trips use the Mora, more than 3 days out take the PeaceMaker as well.  A good CRKT Tomahawk would round out a modern mountain man's craft, or an Estwing Campers axe.  Primitive is fine, but this is the 21st century and survival comes before Ego and pride, so take a couple cheap bic lighters, maybe a flint, but an Axe/Hatchet/tomahawk is a must, and, (at the very least), two good knives are a serious real world necessity.","Great backup and practical inexpensive fighter, good for field use as well",True,15.0
B00BD57RZW,5.0,"We (myself included) rave over Mora knives, and rightfully so--considering the low cost, they are fabulous.  But I also can laud the virtues of Cold Steel products (I have several), including this model.  Construction is flawless.  It came as sharp as one can expect.  It's full tang.  3 mm in thickness.  The handle is narrow, but offers a good grip, thanks to its high friction material and contoured shape.  The flat handle makes me wonder if some folks might like to use it as a boot knife--but maybe it's a little large for that kind of carry, I don't know.  I don't wear boots and I don't carry weapons in that way.  I do love the knife, but did not like the sheath.  The belt clip is way too small and way too stiff.  The knife fit into the sheath in a rather insecure fashion.  I threw the sheath out and made a leather one that suits me much more.  So, for 2, 3, 4 dollars more than a Mora, you can get a solid, sharp, stainless knife with a bigger blade.  To me, that represents a value.",A genuine value!,True,
B00BD57RZW,4.0,"Another great value from Cold Steel. I love this knife for what is is, a good cheap multi-use knife. I also have always liked the blade profile of these knives. I have the Mora Forest knife which is the same blade profile as this knife. But I gotta say I prefer this knife over the Mora. Don't get me wrong, Mora puts out great, cheap knives. But this version I feel edges out Moras for a few of reasons. First, the CS version blade is twice as thick as Moras. On the Mora blade, when the blade takes it's drastic thinning nearly halfway to the point, that end is pretty thin. Because Mora uses a thinner blade, the distal taper end looks like it wouldn't hold up to thrusting that well. The end looks like it would bend at a right angle if thrust very hard into anything.

With the CS version, the blade is twice as thick, so the distal taper is thicker as well. In fact, the tapered point is as thick as the thickest part of the blade on the Mora. Second, price. The Mora is about $5 dollars more than the CS knife. Also the CS blade is over an inch longer than the Mora, giving you more edge to work with. Third, if you ever go to Mora's site, you can see a cutout of their blades and see that all Mora blades are 3/4 tang. The CS knife (according to CS) is full tang. Overall the CS knife is just a better value.

However, I do prefer the Mora sheath and handle just a bit more to the CS sheath and handle. But both offer a hard rubber handle that excels at grip. Plus the CS knife also comes with a lanyard hole. With similar steels, there isn't much difference in performance. For those who are not a fan of the sheath and want a more traditional carry option, you can use a Ka-Bar leather sheath for their short (5 inch) knives. I had a black one laying around and it fits the knife like a glove. And the Ka-Bar sheaths are pretty good quality for the price (usually under $10). So I ditched the plastic sheath that came with this knife and use the leather sheath for a more traditional carry. I would recommend this knife for anyone looking for a great multi-use knife.",Cold Steel Value,True,44.0

B00BERBXN6,3.0,"I own several jumpropes ranging from an RX jumprope down to a cheap plastic handled playground rope.  This falls in the middle.  The cable is a BEAST! It is thick and will provide a weighted workout if you are doing a workout involving 200 or more repetitions.  The handles are a little less refined and lower quality than the Valeo deluxe jumprope handles.

The advantage to this rope is that a metal cable will not stretch during revolutions or over time.  But this is a minor issue for most of us.  The other benefit is that it opens up in a wide arc thanks to the weight and metal cable.

B00BERBXN6,1.0,"I bought from seller CHIPSANDGAMES, Fulfilled by Amazon.  I would not want to pay $1 for this at dollar store.

First of all, be sure to print or bookmark the instructions given for how to adjust the length of the rope because it is not in the package. You will need to adjust the length unless you about 9 feet tall. However, I suggest you save time and money now, just don't buy it - at least from CHIPSANDGAMES.

Second, the ""rope"" looks and feels like a thin silver shiny weightless ribbon encased in thin cheap plastic.  It does not uncurl as it should and I can't imagine how it will ""flow"" when actually in use.  Then, when I unscrewed the cheap plastic handle caps to adjust rope length, according to directions I was supposed to find two weights inside.  What I found was a hollow handle with a flat thin washer crimped in half around the end of the so-called rope.  No weights, no ball bearing mechanism.  TOTAL RIPOFF FROM CHIPSANDGAMES.

B00CL0T5YY,5.0,"Over the years and many travels across West Africa and the Middle East in my old, loyal, and brave Land Rover, I have used many different types and brands of paracords. I use them for every thing from wrapping my knife and machete handles to holding down gear on top of roof rack. I used them to tie down gear on my kayak, and on trips on horseback.
Titan Paracords,are among the very best, hands down; they have never let me down. They are tough, reliable, easy on the palms of your hands and, last but not least, beautiful; yes, I said that, even though it may not sound as an appropriate adjective to be used by a manly man to describe paracords.

By the way, Titan neither paid me, nor asked me to write this review. Recently, I bought some more cord on Amazon for a 2000 mile trip, and being big on writing reviews, positive or negative, I wrote this. I view Amazon shoppers as a community and think it is good for us to share our evaluations as customers; sharing helps all of us.
I hope this review was helpful,

B00CL0T5YY,5.0,"The old adage still rings true, ""You get what you pay for"".  In this day and age of instant fulfillment and on-line competition, we're tempted to think otherwise.  Many will notice how many items are identical, yet sold under various names and at differing prices... that's often a clue for poor specs, likely poor quality, and generally poor value, despite the low price.  Titan's products are clearly more expensive than the consumer/commodity grade resellers of low value equivalents, but are also clearly better specified, of far better quality unit-to-unit, and represent a sound, good value for your money.  How often do you read about ""seller problems"" from those consumer/commodity/same-item-many-seller items?  Titan takes care with fulfillment, and follows up for satisfaction.  In my mind, being able to be confident the product I'm seeking is solid in specs, spot-on in quality, and while pricey will give me the value I want is worth paying more.
  This is tough, durable 7-filament-twisted-strand (one a marker strand) paracord with good strength specs and performance that exceeds expectations. Beyond that, the paracord comes with a velcro buckle-strap, that alone worth a buck in versatile value.  Colors aren't as numerous as those sold by companies whose market is crafting, but are adequate in number for outdoors purposes.  If you want paracord for strong, outdoor use, this is the real deal on the plus side; if you want cord only for crafting, you might prefer other sellers for their wide range of colors and far less 'stiff/strong' cord that will be far easier to manipulate.
  Although this is a review of their standard paracord, it's important to point out that Titan also makes a ""SurvivorCord"" that contains, in addition to their 7-twisted-strands, a 25lb monofilament line, a strand of fine gauge brass wire, and a strand of waxed Jute fiber. This is even more expensive cord, but allows the outdoors person to carry one hank for multiple purposes, replacing items that may previously have been brought along just for ""what if"" purposes.","In Product Specs, Build Quality and Vendor Performance, You Still ""Get What You Pay For""; Titan is the Real Deal Plus",True,6.0

B00CL0T5YY,5.0,"My initial use of TITAN Paracord (ACU Gray), introduced me to the many advantages of their quality.  Although priced higher than other paracord suppliers advertising a variety of colors, I soon discovered TITAN's strength and uniform quality was definitely worth the price.

Unlike competing products, TITAN Paracord uses better quality cord sheath, which is tight, smooth and more uniform throughout the entire 100 foot length with no bulges, twists or weaker areas.  For me, this translates to more consistent strength and ease of use, with fewer sags, twists or kinking than cheaper cords.  The cord is tight, firm and extremely strong.  TITAN's passion for quality has even improved the overall finished appearance of my paracord projects.

If there is any criticism, it is, TITAN's color selection is less substantial than I would like, but some colors such as ""ACU Gray"" and ""Digital Blue"" are outstanding, so I can hardly wait to see what TITAN Survival adds to their paracord line, next.

TITAN Survival is one of the few genuine paracords meeting exacting U.S. military (MIL-SPEC) standards, and the company is a dedicated supporter of armed forces and U.S, Veterans.  I highly recommend TITAN Survival's paracord.",TITAN is Absolute Best Paracord I've Found!',False,

B00CL0T5YY,5.0,"After using this product for a proect I had in mind I must admit that it has realy surprised me so far.
I used it to hang a 50 lb deer feeder. Seeing the load rating was over 500 lbs I was suspicious if it would hold 50 lbs in the air running through 2 pullys and swinging around as the wind blew. But after a week I went to the hunt club and let the feeder down to fill it with corn and inspect the cord for any worn spots where the pullys come in contact with it. So far so good. There are no wear marks or chafing at all on the cord. It does streach a bit under the weight but not bad at all and that was completely anticipated. The only thing I will change on my next feeder is that I will buy the camo colored cord. At the time of my purchace I wasn't thinking of using this to hang feeders but thought I would give it a try after receiving it and using some of it for securing items on the property. But on mu feeder you can spot the fluorescent color of this cord for a long wasy off through the woods. It sticks out like a sore thumb which is the exact results you want when using a fluorescent colored item. The diameter of the cord and the strength of it has truly surprised me and will start using it on all of my smaller deer feeder sites in a couple of weeks if all goes well with this one. I will advise if anything adverse happens in the near future. I would recommend this cord to any of my friends needing a high quality cord type product in the future.

B00CL0T5YY,4.0,"When I opened the box I was surprised to see a cord that looked more orange or faded red than the deep red that was pictured. I needed the color of cord that was in the picture as my intention was to make paracord bracelets with the colors of a specific team for family members who are fans... And a different color will not do for true fans. So now I need to look elsewhere to find what I need (which does not make me happy after spending $16). Having said that, all of the other Titan paracord I have ordered has arrived looking the same color as pictured. The cord is strong and you can tell it is of good quality. For survival and prepping purposes you really could not ask for better cord. I also like how it is wound and bound with a Velcro strap. When unwinding it I have not ended up with a knotted mess of cord like I have with other cords. Also, it is easy to just take the cord you need and then put the Velcro back on (no need to wind the cord another way than how you received it if you don't want to). As far as price goes, yes, it cost a bit more, but I'm willing to pay that to get quality cord that will not let me down when I need it the most. This cord would have been 5 stars if it had been the color in the picture. The truly red paracord bracelet in the picture is another brand...

Worth the money if you cant afford a metal boat or if you have no where to keep a big boat this fits in my trunk.,love this boat,True,
B00CMBJ1VE,4.0,"I got this boat to take out on the local lakes around Indiana so that I could cover more of the lake shores crappie fishing.  The boat takes a while to inflate with the pump that comes with it.  There are three main chambers to inflate, the floor, the inner hull, and the outer hull.  Once inflated the boat is farely sturdy, and I am 260 lbs.  The fishing pole holders are a nice addition, and they come with plugs that you attach to your pole and then plug into the holder when you want to row or something other than fish.  The boat is very easy to deflate.  It only took about 15 minutes to get all the air out so that I could pack into my car.  It comes with a large bag, and packed up it fits in the back seat of my 2 door Honda Civic.

The two complaints that I have Are that the oars are a little too short, and the repair kit is useless (see paragraph below about the repair kit).  They could be about 5 to 10 inches longer.  I felt like I was rowing with my arms straight up in the air most of the time, which was incredibly exhausting.  I then discovered that I could easily row with one oar while facing forward and my knees on the seat at the bow of the boat.  This was much faster and less exhausting.  It is stable because the bow of the boat's air chambers are about 2 feet long providing maximum stability for sitting, rowing, or fishing at the bow.  You can get a trolling motor mount for this thing, and I think it says it will handle a 1.5 hp motor.  I will definitely be getting the trolling motor mounted on it as soon as I get my license and register the boat.  The lake permit (Indiana) sticks pretty well to the port side of the bow, but when deflated it wrinkles up.  I am hoping it stretches out okay when I inflate the boat again. [UPDATE]: The sticker stretched back out okay, but the edges were coming off a little.  I would maybe suggest using the pvc or vinyl glue used for patching.

This boat will NOT take a finning from fish.  An 8 lbs catfish fell on the gunwale (on the inner hull side) and punched a little hole on top of the inner hull buoyancy chamber.  There are 3 buoyancy chambers, so it wasn't a safety concern.  I was about 20 minutes from the boat dock, and I made it back with plenty of air in the inner hull's chamber.  I attempted to make the repair with the repair kit that came with the boat and that repair kit is terrible.  It wouldn't even stick to the boat (fully deflated following all instructions), hence the 4 star review.  I ended up going to the closest Walmart and buying a cheap $4.00 Rubber/Nylon repair kit.  It held pretty well.

All-in-all, this is the perfect boat for a good price if you have no place to store a boat, or if your car won't haul a john boat or something similar.",Nice Boat for Fishing,True,137.0

However, we felt a consistent need to top up the boat with more air every few days, and it had very little balance out on the lake with even a little wind. Felt very insecure and saggy trying to mount and unmount it from the car and carry to the water. Hard to maneuver the thing even with a trolling motor.

B00CMBJ1VE,5.0,"I've had this raft for about 8 years.  It has about 25 holes, patched together with duck tape and bubblegum.  I've done things with this raft your not supposed to do.  I've taken this raft places you shouldn't go.  And I've jammed so many people in here, even the manufacturer would cringe.  And I can honestly say, this is the BEST investment I've made in my entire life!

In April 2010, me and 7 college buddies crammed into this sucker down the Lehigh River.  It had rained for three days, and the water was 40 degrees.  One of us sat on a beer can that crunched into shrapnel and ripped a massive hole in Compartment 1.  Luckily, this raft has 3 air compartments, so we did not sink, but the sheer weight of us all nearly submerged her.

But things got worse, when we made a wrong turn, and found ourselves caught in a rapid stream filled with sticker bushes.  We tried to stop her, but the water was too fast, and we collided head first into some dagger branches.  It blew open Compartment 2.

We chopped through the brusque using our oars and barely snuck through back onto the main course.  But the raft was heavily damaged.  So like the ol' Dutch boy, we took turns sticking our fingers into the holes, as another one of us continuously pumped air to keep her afloat.

By the end of the 5 mile journey, we were floating on a noodle.  The 7 of us huddled atop of each other, as we wrapped the sides around us like a blanket to stop the water from gushing in.

But in the end, we made it.  Alive.  And surprisingly not too wet.  We fixed her up the following day, using glue, patches, and a roll of duck tape.  We took her out the following weekend, and she floated like a charm.  I've since passed this raft down to my little sister, and she and her friends use it all the time.  Holes, patches, and all.",The Best Investment of My Life!!!,False,2.0

For illinois too many problem. Boat registiration stickers and licance. When u motorized need licence.

Cons::. Was a bit challenging for me and wifey to get around in this. It takes two people who can paddle easily together and even then it's a bit hard. Might need another set of paddles or something.

Overall::. It was a lot of fun. I saw a few pictures of people adding a motor to it, would be super easy and cool to do that and would take the stress of paddling away.

I have called Intex Corp and they will be sending a return label... After speaking to a supervisor they asked me to cut up a part of the boat where its leaking and send it to them in order to get a new one and told me to stay updated on their online claim section... which the next day I notice that my claim was rejected I contacted Intex. over an hour later I did get a response and was told it was a mistake and that my claim should be processed in a day or 2...  scared and angered me for a second. A few days later, the replacement boat arrived. turns out to be an early version of last years model rather than the current hull model. I had to register the boat for use with a trolling motor in CA again because they wouldn't refund me what I spent on the registration from the last one. Dealing with the customer service was quite a horrible experience...

  I was finally able to register and test out the replacement Intex Corp. sent me. I used a Newport Vessel 55 Lbs Trolling Motor (Available On Amazon! Great Motor!) paired with a Wal-Mart DC29 Marine Battery with 122 Amp Hour and attached the motor to the Intex Motor Mount I purchased for the prior boat. I was able to inflate the boat in 20 to 25 Minutes thanks to the Intex Electric Pump. With no modification to the boat (with the exception of leaving the front seat behind I took it out into the lake. The boat did very well in the water with the motor it was paired with. The older model has lower walls than the newer model but it did not cause any issues even when dealing with large wakes by larger and faster boats. You do feel the wakes left off by other faster and larger boats so unless you add your own wood flooring standing on this is close to impossible. About 2 hours into being in the lake I did feel like the boat was slightly deflated and got a bit paranoid. I was warned that PVC has a tendency to stretch a bit as the day gets warmer as it causes the air in the boat to expand. Fortunately I had the measuring strip provided with the boat and the boat kept its pressure. Deflation was simple but unfortunately the bag (Cheap bag) ripped easily so I now wrap it with a tarp that I lay down under the boat to inflate it. I have yet to use the oars to row the boat but honestly... I don't trust them...

After everything I have dealt with I have to admit that I am satisfied that the replacement model worked and gave me no issues. It is a rather large boat and I could have definitely had 2 or 3 more people with me on the boat. It was infuriating to pay for the registration all over again and dealing with Intex Customer Service but overall I am satisfied with the product. I am considering purchasing one of their Kayaks but I would have to test & evaluate ASAP in order to deal with Amazon with the return rather than Intex... I should point out some things:

Pros:
Lightweight
Easy To Set Up
Plenty Of Space To Sit
Works Well With 55 Lbs Trolling Motor (About 6 to 8 MPH)
4 Rod Holders
Comes With Essentials (Oars, Hand Pump, Bag)

Cons:

Pump Is Fair Quality But Can Break.
Others Have Complaint Of Oars Breaking. Oars Do Feel Weak.
Quality Control Issues With Manufacturing Facilities. Seam leaks seem to be a common defect.
Customer Service Is Sub Standard & Online Claim System Is Broken.

Special Notes:
Test any Intex product before you hit the water with it ASAP for leaks and/or manufactures defects.
Intex Boats Only Have A 90 Day Warranty

I purchased the boat, motor mount, minn kota battery center, marine battery, life vests, and a 55 lb thurst trolling motor to make an amazing boat.
I have taken it out multiple times and have not had a bad experience yet!
Fit 5 adults VERY snuggly along with the gear.  Wouldn't recommend doing that all the time as it gets very tight.  I would say 4 is the most I would do if I wanted to stay comfortable throughout the ride.
People say not to put more than a 30 pound thrust motor but my boat is handling fine with the 55 (almost wished I went even stronger!)
Only down side is that oars are impossible to utilize in the holders... I hold one and another person holds the other and we work together to move the boat (this is, of course, when I am not using the motor).
I have fished in this boat with two friends.  Not the most practical method, but very enjoyable.
Storage is also just a dream with this thing.  All gear fits great in my RAV-4 trunk.
I have researched many mods such as a bimini or a floor which are great and look cool. My only thing is that it would make transporting just more inconvenient.  A floor would be a nice addition as its hard to stand or walk in, but again, too inconvenient to transport.

B00CMBJ1VE,5.0,"We have taken this boat out 2x now. after unpacking the boat and looking at all the parts it came with I was certain that the pump would break at first use. (it felt really cheap) I have now used the pump multiple times, pumping up the boat 3x, other inflatables multiple times. The pump did come apart once, but luckily all that happens was the lower portion got loose. Forget using the small electric pumps. You will sit a long time waiting. The bag that they provide for storing the boat is nice but I'm very not sure how ling it'll last, because the bag feels very thin. Might get a plastic bin with wheels if it rips.  The oars do what they do, metal and plastic construction and they collapse nicely.  The rubber material is very soft especial after it sits in the sun for a few hours. Since the material gets softer from the sun that causes the motor mount to dip into the water with a trolling motor. (while using stock Intex mount) This boat is very big!

- this boat does not hold air long; to make sure it stays float, I have to bring inflator and fill air up while floating;
- material is not thick; it's easy to get penetrated by sharp rock or stick when it is pushed in water.",It was fun to cruise on the calm lake,True,7.0

2. It is very VERY heavy!  It takes two people to move it.
3. Only comes with one set of oars
4. The boat doesn't move with the oars.  Forget about moving fast.
5. no skeg.  This thing is impossible to orient . The wind or current would kill your orientation without a motor.  I truly believe this boat is unusable without a motor.  This boat was basically useless because of this.

B00CMBJ1VE,5.0,"I purchased this boat in July 2016. Its the best money I spent in a very long time. Me and my two kids have spent countless hours boating and fishing all over!!! In August I went on vacation to 1000 islands in upstate NY and Canada. We took a chance and put this boat through the test out in that LARGE body of water. It did GREAT!!!! We were way out with there with the big boats, yachts and even passing barges. I would highly recommend having a strong troll motor if you go out into a large lake with strong wind & waves. I have a 52lb thrust troll motor. It handled the very strong waters of 1000 islands very well. It handled this lake so most other lakes will be a piece of cake. (Cons) It doesn't seat five as advertised. It will seat four adults. Three adults are more comfortable. The fishing pole holders can only be trusted in calm waters only. I lost one of my fishing poles in the rough waters of 1000 islands. Over all it was a great purchase and I highly recommend it to anyone who's thinking about purchasing this boat.

I did a two piece carpeted hardwood floor with 4 3/4"" pvc pipes running below it for added stability, and I am just using fold out lawnchairs for now.  I wired switches and lights to the trolling motor battery for night fishing.  This includes a bow and stern light with two cree spots.  I got the Minn Kota 50 pound thrust motor running off of a 105Ah battery with the minn kota power center.  Depth finder which is mounted to the top of a 7 dollar battery case that houses all the wires, depth finder, and odds and ends when not in use.  I used bungee cords to hold everything down and to attach to the bottom of the motor mount kit to the hardwood floor to keep the motor from dipping.  I am able to get out to those spots in the lake I could never get to before.

All in all,  I have invested about 800 dollars into everything you see here, but I have a boat that takes less than 20 minutes to setup and everything fits in my jeep easily.

B00CMBJ1VE,5.0,"We purchased this boat along with the motor mount and trolling motor.  It is an affordable way to get out on the water to fish, relax and enjoy ourselves.  We took it camping and used it on the lake there and we take it to our local lake.  The rubber/plastic is holding up well.  The one drawback I'd say is that the oar holders get soft and pliable in the sun and I'm afraid of an oar falling off and losing it in the water, so, we just keep them tucked in to the inside, side, of the boat when we are out.  The oars are sturdy and nice.  It's no where near a five person (adult persons) boat, though.  Don't go by that.  But it's great for two or three.  Wish also that they put in a screw off air inlet valve in the bottom like the other two are for the top and sides, it's just a regular pop up and squeeze valve and harder to fill up and empty when finished.

It was a bit of a pain to carry down to the water but once we were there it was fun.  On a side note, don't let your kids play with the oars while you are trying to but them through the oar locks.

I took to Google and with a few custom pieces it is a very sturdy vessel that fits 2 adults and 3 children comfortably.

Although the pump works well enough, I would recommend getting the upgraded 2-way pump that also deflates by simply switching the air hose on the pump handle.

Under the floor i have 5 pieces of pvc pipe (1 inch I think, roughly 7.5-8 feet in length) that fit in the grooves of the inflated bottom of the boat for additional stability and can stand up without too much effort and balance. The kids were able to stand and jump over the sides with no problems at all. I finally added the Intex motor mount, a Minn Kota Endura C2 30 trolling motor with a Minn Kota power center (battery box), and a 12 Volt 35 Amp Deep Cycle Battery. We drove around a small cove for a few hours quickly and very quietly enjoying the day at the lake.

B00CMBJ1VE,4.0,"We are using boat with a Minn Kota Endura MAX 55 trolling motor.

Our configuration today was two adults (totaling about 320 lbs), and 2 kids (totaling about 80 lbs), this motor (about 50 lbs), large tackle box (maybe 20 lbs), battery in battery box (maybe 25 lbs), and a bag of other misc stuff (food, water, etc, maybe 10 lbs). So somewhere around 500lbs of stuff.

Cruising at 30% forward on the motor handle yielded 1.5 mph. Cruising at full 100% forward yielded 3.5 mph. I measured using a map/navigation app on my cell phone. We cruised around the lake for about 2 hours, mostly at 30% with maybe 10 minutes total of random bursts to 100% for fun. Batteries were still showing full charge on the Minn Kota battery box as well as on the motor's battery gauge. I am impressed--faster then I thought it would be and way less energy use then I expected. (although this is my first trolling motor so I don't have anything to compare to)

My battery configuration is kinda odd.... I have qty 4 6V 12Ah batteries in a parallel/series configuration. So It gives be 12v output and I believe it would give 24Ah capacity (not totally sure on this one). I had these lying around from a UPS battery replacement project that never happened. I was planning to get a 100Ah battery but I may keep this rig for a while as it's working better then I expected.

The boat itself inflates easily with the electric pump.. It took us about 30 minutes to get it in the water and roughly the same to put it back in the car.  Definitely enough flotation for our passengers and equipment (from above).  It doesn't feel like it will tip over to dip to far if someone moves to a different seat.

I have 2.5 complaints so far:
1. when sitting in the rear and operating the motor, I have to sit sideways to the right side of the seat (using my left hand to drive) to be able to comfortably operate the motor
2. the battery does not fit behind the rear seat, so, since the cables coming off the trolling motor are only so long, I have to put the battery right in front of the seat, off to the left (remember I'm sideways on the right of the seat).
2.5 the front fishing rod holders are more angled straight up then out to the side (as I'd think they would be).  The rear ones are fine.

I noticed another model the Intex Mariner 3 has a spot behind the seat for the battery..... would be nice to make ours do this too.

B00CMBJ1VE,2.0,"This thing is more of a hassle than it is enjoyable.  Uncomfortable to sit in, sort of have to wiggle around to move anywhere.  To say this is a 5 person inflatable boat is an insult to anyone with common sense.  There is no way 5 people are fitting in this boat with gear unless you're all midgets.

I put the motor mount, motor, fish finder, whole 9 yards into this thing and I am not that thrilled with it, yeah others have put floors in it and pedestal seats, but that's just more money for a stupid inflatable boat.  Might as well get a real boat, or a kayak for that matter.  For the money I put into this boat I could have easily got 2 kayaks, a kayak rack, and would have been SET.  Instead I went this route and will end up losing at least a few hundred dollars when I try to resell everything.

If you're planning on getting this without a motor, don't even bother, this thing is literally incapable of moving on the water via paddling, it's like trying to paddle a gigantic cardboard box, it has no tracking, and the bottom of the boat was designed with no thought of this in mind.

The last straw for me was when I tried to take it out without the motor just to see how it was paddling.  We almost got swept out to sea in all of 5 minutes, my son turned to me and said ""Good thing it's not my birthday, this would have been the crappiest gift ever"".  Hahahah!  I agree, it's a makeshift boat that has no business on the water unless you really want an intense workout.  Me, I bought it to relax and have fun, not to have a heart attack or work out the entire time.

I will say the motor changes this boat considerably and makes it more enjoyable, but it's still uncomfortable, awkward to move in, and it does not seat 3 people comfortably with gear.  2 people max with gear.  I put a lot of time and research into this before I purchased this and after my experiences with it my overall feelings are it's just not worth it.  Get a kayak or two, a small jon boat, anything but this, it's a money pit and you will end up dissatisfied in the end.  The only thing that could make this boat better would be a solid floor, that might be a game changer, but I am not dumping anymore money into this thing.

Setup time is way too long, i'd say 20-30 minutes to set up, then another 20-30 minutes to unpack/deflate.

2. The storage bag it comes with is the cheapest quality. The bag ripped open at the seams and the zipper fell apart on the first attempt to put the raft away.

(See Youtube video entitled Trip to Shell Island Excursion 5) We had a ball and never once felt like the raft was going to capsize even in 3 foot swells.  I did put in a plywood floor so it would be a bit more stable and I would have a flat surface to tie the trolling motor battery to, but it is not required.  There are alot of videos out there on how to do some crazy mods on this thing...check them out.  We tried rowing in St Andrews bay, but the wind was so bad it was a fruitless endeavor, but it rows good on a calm lake.  My biggest concern was the stablity of the thing when I was getting in, but it wasn't a problem, even without the wood floor.  I spent $120 on the raft, $25 on the motor mount, $75 on the trolling motor, $70 on the battery, and $50 on the plywood floor...so, for about $350, I got a pretty awesome boat that I don't have to tow around on a trailer.  Check out the videos on Youtube",You can't beat this for the price!  Extremely stable and roomy!!!,True,5.0
B00CMBJ1VE,5.0,"Easy to inflate, no issues on 5 day camping trip. I love it - we could fit 2 adults and 3 kids (better with just two adults but that's selfish, lol). Seems sturdy and, when used with the Minn Kota 40 trolling motor, it had just the right amount of power. I wouldn't go less than 40 though. This boat is light - my husband and I carried it easily to the water. I recommend a little electric pump for it (I think we got the electric 12v car pump from Coleman). I bought some custom fit floorboards from Etsy and am waiting on those, but you could use this with no floorboards - just don't plan on standing as, like most inflatables, it's a little squishy.",Just what we wanted for fishing!,True,
B00CMBJ1VE,4.0,"Survived its maiden voyage.  I didn't use a clock, but I would guess it was about 20-30 minutes from the box to the water inflating it with the included pump out in the Texas summer heat.  Set up was pretty straight forward.  The included pump hooks up directly to all 6 different places that need air (they say do not use a compressor to fill the boat).  Front and rear seats are comfortable - middle seat is not, so I would say the boat seats 3 comfortably, 5 in a pinch.  The included oars are pretty good quality - strong and sturdy - they are also versatile and can be put together as a kayak oar or used as 2 row boat oars.",good boat for the money,True,3.0
B00CMBJ1VE,5.0,"Well if you are reading this you are probably considering buying this boat. Great choice but before you purchase understand this is more than a $150 boat and it has some limitations.
First and foremost it does not seat 5 people. It is more of a 2 to maybe 3 adults. 2 adults and a couple of kids would work pretty well.
Second, trying to row this big boat is tough. You will want a trolling motor for this boat.
Third, at least in North Dakota, if you put a trolling motor on any boat, including inflatables, it needs to be registered with game and fish and you have to follow boating laws. (If you don't put a motor on it you shouldnt have to register it)
Fourth, this is an air boat, it works extremely well on little to no current. I haven't tried it in a river with a current yet but i don't think i want to.

Overall im very pleased with this boat. It seems to be tough as the vinyl is thicker than an air mattress. The fishing pole holders seem cheap and in don't think id trust my poles using them. The boat is very portable but is pretty heavy. Much easier to load and unload with 2 people. Also this boat is rated for 1300 pounds people and equipment weight. I have at least 800 pounds in my boat at all times and it floats great and moves pretty good (5 mphish) with the trolling motor.

Alright, if you are still reading here are my suggestions of what you should buy with the purchase of this boat.
1. Trolling motor mounting kit
2. Trolling motor (i used a minn kota endura max 40 thrust). The boat is only rated to 30 thrust or 1.5 hp (33lbs max motor weight according to the box) but im pretty confident you could fit a bigger motor on this if you wanted to.
3. Minn kota power center battery box. This box is great, it shows you battery life remaining and has spots for dc power so you can charge your phone and whatnot.
4. A 29 series deep cycle battery. I used an everstart maxx 29 from walmart
5. Minn kota portable battery charger. I like this charger because it has overcharge protection and is very lightweight and easy to use.
6. A 4 pack of life vests. I bought the orange cheapos but they work fine just to be legal
7. An air horn
8. An anchor. I think mine is 3 or 5 lbs. Trust me you want an anchor as the boat floats away easily when you are trying to stay still.
9. I bought a fire extinguisher. Not required by law but it makes me feel safer
10. Bow and stearn light (green/red for bow and white for back). I found a set for inflatables on amazon and they are AA battery powered.
11. An electric air pump. I bought a dc powered one so i can use the truck at the lake to power the pump and inflate the boat.
12. Industrial strength outdoor velcro. Stuff kind of flops around in the boat. Velcro keeps stuff organized
13. I would consider buying a couple large plastic bins to carry and store the boat
14. Loctite! The bolts holding the motor mount seem to loosen on their own. Using some loctite should help that
15. I am buying led light strips for my boat for better lighting at night
16. Buy dock bumpers if you plan on landing this at a dock. You don't want sharp metal or wood puncturing it",Great boat,True,876.0

B00CMBJ1VE,5.0,Got a few weeks ago finally used. Used on Grand lake in ohio. Was suprised with stability was able to stand up in it an walk without floor mod you have to balance though. Had on very choppy water with it splashing up inside of boat and done great. I used a 55 lb thrust trolling motor and on calm water with gps was moving at 5 to 5.5 mph wich was impressive and spent hours puttinh around and fishing. The seals and handles air valves all are very durable. Bought a an 12volt inflinflatable pump for 15 bucks on here and inflates all air chambers in ten minutes or less. This raft is pretty versitile and has plenty of upgrade options and is worth every penny. Bought motor mount from amazon also new port vessles trolling motor. I would recomend motor for sure this raft is HUGE!had 5 people in it and was pretty roomy. It is to big to row efficiently. Remember people it is an inflatable boat and has to have a registraion and sticker to run on public waters. It was $33 dollars for this in ohio. Its great for ponds lakes and soft to medium river currents. It is a pretty tuff vynal material seems pretty tough but its not puncture proof so use.common sense.

B00CMBJ1VE,4.0,"I have put off reviewing this item for a while.  I have owned it for 1 year and used it several times.  It has been deflated and stored twice and then reinflated for use.  It has been used on a small ""neighborhood"" lake which is very protected and easy to boat on.  Out of the box (which it can never fit back into) is is difficult for me to justify a 4-star rating.  It is uncomfortable to sit in and wherever you step/sit becomes a depression as you push the air into other parts of the boat.  Just like pushing in one part of a balloon.  Intuitively, you know aht this will be the situation with an inflatable product.  It is fine for children, but not great for adults.

I modified the boat by adding a wooden floor and trolling motor along with a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Intex-Motor-Mount-Kit-for-Intex-Inflatable-Boats/dp/B00177BQF8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Intex Motor Mount Kit for Intex Inflatable Boats</a>.  I also mounted a swivel seat to the floor.  This adds to the cost of the ""boat"" and takes some work, but the usefulness of the end product is quite good.  The wood floor was cut from 0.75"" plywood and makes it so when you sit or walk the bottom cannot deform and depress around you.  It feels very stable.  It is still an inflatable boat, so there are limits, but it works.

Two adults use the boat periodically for fishing or just boating around.  It still looks like the Beverly Hillbilly's in an inflatable raft, but you can see that from the pictures.

B00CMBJ1VE,2.0,The first problem I encountered with this boat was that it was way too easy to under and over inflate this thing. I know it sounds crazy how could it be both right? When we filled this in the shade we would fill it to capacity and load everything up. Once the sun warms up the tubes they will stretch and if you are using a strong trolling motor you will have to pull over to inflate it. So we thought we might just fill it in the sun to not have that happen again because it got old real quick after 4 trips out. The problem we encountered that trip was that a 4 inch blue gill was able to puncture the boat. You read right people a 4 inch bluegill crippled this boat on the main tube. I'm not sure if we over inflated it or it was just weak due to being in the sun for hours on end (the material loses it durable feeling after heating up it feels more like a pool toy.) If you cant catch bluegill without fear of popping the tubes its not worth anything at all. my final complaint would have to be that if these things are so easily punctured they should come with a complete patching kit including the adhesive. If you really cant afford anything better just know you are going to have to be extremely careful and could be out of 150 bucks at any moment. Now I am out close to 200 after registration fees for this. Do yourselves all a favor even if you are not fishing and go with the mariner 4. Intex hit the nail on the head with it although it cost more you are only going to get what you pay for. It is much more durable and has an inflatable keel for improved steering. You can also stand up due to the corrugated plaster floor insert. In closing I do see this boat having a place for people on a budget but as ive said before if you can afford the mariner its a winner for sure.,fishermen beware!,True,16.0

For the price it performs great for what it was designed to do, but keep in mind though it's an inflatable lake toy and not a real boat. Real inflatable boats cost a thousand or more for a reason. Some of the things people are doing with this boat in the reviews is idiotic. I'm not sure if they are just blissfully unaware of the danger they put themselves in going into large unprotected water in a very under powered toy or what. Don't go far offshore, or into any rough water. It has a max hull speed of about 5 mph no matter what size engine you use because the low pressure tubes start deforming at any speed higher than that. Don't go into any conditions where you need any kind of speed or power to get out of like currents, waves, or wind. A 15-20 mph wind will push even a 55lb trolling motor to it's limit on this boat so don't go out in anything like that or you might not have enough power to get back. For the price it is great small lake boat, but the seams and valves are just too cheap too stand up to any prolonged use of more then a season or two. Don't waste a lot of money on expensive modifications, it won't last long enough to make them worth it. For the money I really wouldn't expect anything more than that so that's okay, but If you want an inflatable that is a lot more durable and will last 5 to 10 years for a little bit more check out boatstogo.com. or something similar. It will be cheaper to get a more expensive boat that lasts a long time then to keep replacing cheap ones (and registration costs if needed). Enjoy this boat for what it is, a fun inexpensive way to get out on a small lake on a nice calm day.

B00CMBJ1VE,5.0,"This is my first boat and it has been a great experience.  I love the fact that this boat comes with everything you need to get into the water.  This is the biggest boat intex makes.  Though it is not their boat most geared to saltwalter travel, it can handle it just fine.  Where i live, the closest body of water is the marina near the ocean.  Close by the land is closed off so waves are not an issue.  But i clean my boat of the salt well after every use.  It says it fits 5 but 2-3 is a comfortable number to have a lot of space.  Another aspect to note is that these intex and other inflatable boats are very customizable and you can google videos on this.  It allows those who may not have the space for a sophisticated boat to customize their inflatable to be how they want it.  Wooden hard floors, special seats, cargo support on the hull of the boat, and even support for stronger motors than what the boat is rated for.  I have done a lot of research and as far as the intex line goes, the seahawk 4 seems to be the prefered freshwater fishing boat while i feel the excursion 5 leans a little more towards comfort because it is wider and a bit longer.  Intex mariner 4 seems to be the most ideal for aggressive water fishing like large bodies of saltwater, though you can customize any boat in their line to do just as well.  One must figure out what suits them and what price they want to pay.  But if comfort is your objective and space, the excursion 5 i feel is thebl best in this class.",Awesome boat,True,2.0
B00CMBJ1VE,5.0,"Very thick material. The included pump looks like a cheap piece of crap, but I've never seen anything hand powered blow up something so big so fast. Literally takes a few minutes. Upon blowing it up, my two saint bernards thought it was their new play toy. While I was initially pretty nervous about that, the boat's material is very thick, and had no problem with their razor sharp claws jumping all over it. Haven't taken it out on the water yet, but if it can go through my dogs without a scratch, I'm fairly confident in the material's ability to resist puncture. Pretty tough stuff indeed.",Awesome.,True,12.0
B00CMBJ1VE,5.0,"I got the boat last week and blew it up in my garage to make sure that there weren't any leaks or problems before we took it out fishing for the weekend. And everything worked great, It was easy to set up. And i pumped it up with an electric air pump with no problem and just finished blowing up each chamber with the hand pump. Which actually works pretty good.

We took the boat out this weekend to a lake that was at about 9000 ft elevation in the high Uintahs in Utah. The water was very cold so once we put it on the water we had to add a little bit of air and that was expected. but with that hand pump it didn't take long at all.

I don't think i would ever put 5 people on it just like other reviews have said. It's perfect for 2 fisherman or 4 people just to mess around.

I purchased the composite motor mount and a #30 Minn kota trolling motor to go with it. The motor pushed the boat around all weekend with no problem even when it got windy. I also bought the Minn kota power center which is pretty awesome for this set up. I just set the battery on the back seat with me and leaned it up against the side of the boat and it really never got in my way at all. So the only thing that i had to ouse the oars for was to push us away from the shore. But they worked pretty good for that :)

The seats are very comfortable and you could easily sit out there all day without a problem. I will probably ending up putting some sort of hard floor in it. Just so i can put an actuall swivel fishing seat in it. and have somewhere to mount a fish finder. But for the first trip out we were very happy. Even my Fiance was impressed with the purchase and she caught a bunch of fish and got a nice tan at the same time. So overall this was a great purchase and for the price you can't really beat it.

If your wondering about the battery. I bought the size 24 Everstart Maxx marine deep cycle from wal mart and it was worth the extra money. We probably put about 6-7 hours of run time on the motor/battery and when i got home it was still at 66% We never really trolled above setting #2 on the motor but i did try out #5 for a little bit just to see how it would do. But for the most part we just took it nice and slow for the whole trip. And the battery lasted a lot better than i expected.

We can't wait to take it again. Counting the days down until this weekend!",Pretty Awesome! Did The Job better than expected.,True,10.0
B00CMBJ1VE,4.0,"I really like this boat.  It seems to be made of very good quality material and well constructed.  It was easy to set up and filled up quickly with my battery operated airbed pump.

At 12' in length it seems there would be a lot of room, but there really is not.  One friend and I out fishing in it is the max once you throw in your gear and a small cooler.

Four people at most if you just want to float around.  Any more it would be very uncomfortable and crowded.

B00CMBJ1VE,3.0,"Bought this after reading all the positive feedbacks here.  Maybe this was an isolated issue where I was the ""lucky"" one to get the lemon from the batch.  This certainly has been an ordeal as I have bought Intex Excursion 5, Minn Kota 40 Trolly Motor, Minn Kota Power Center, Motor Mount, Extra oars, Intext cordless Pump, and Battery from Walmart.

All of the items purchased from Amazon came in on the date promised.  Before I used it, I went to local California DMV and had the vessel registered and got the CF numbers after paying $89.00.  Had the CF numbers on the back plate and secured it to the boat.  I was ready to go out and have some serious fun!!!.

However, when I had the boat inflated to the recommended settings, I noticed it was loosing air fast!!  I noticed the air was leaking from the seams and seemed like an manufacturers defect.  Could not use the patch since the air was coming from the seams.  Contacted Amazon and had the boat replaced.  Luckily, I had the my other boat with me so I was able to try out the other equipments.  Received a used Minn Kota 40 as well.  Will be writing a separate reviews for it later.

Other than these two major components, my other purchases were great.  Espcially the Minn Kota Power Center and the Motor Mount.  Most of my purchases from Amazon has been spot on, and have great customer service as well as impeccable delivery time, however, better product inspections might be in order.

Boy was I wrong, not only did this bottle keep my drink other time for sure and when I first put it in as. But when I applied is in the beginning of the day it was last as a whole cube with very little melting throughout the entire 24 hours.

On the bottle it is very simple to open up and either fill with your drink and ice, or to simply drink from the bottle. There is a simple closure in the very front as a one button device. This button either goes up or down allowing for you to either open the bottle or to lock it secure for no leaks or spilling.

Purely as a result of keeping her for hours on end I wish I had a million of these bottles. Especially in the summer months it's nice to know that my drink and stay cold with or without ice. But to know that you are I see put in

I would at least like to feel a few degrees different than the ambient air.  All I feel is that I'm wearing a wet hat.  Not to say that's entirely grotesque, but it's not quite what I was hoping for.

The visor has a special liner that you get wet and is supposed to suck heat away from your head as the water evaporates.  What if it's humid out and the water you've applied to the liner doesn't evaporate?  Little to no cooling effect.  (I would love to hear from someone in Arizona who's used this and compare notes.)

But what I really love about this light is, how versatile it is:
- It is an awesome flashlight when you need it at home. We had an power outage recently for 24 hours. We just put this light in a jar, facing the ceiling, and it was spreading light just like a regular night lamp for several hours. We had our dinner and our family time with this light lighting up the room for us!
- It is powerful flashlight to have in your hand while camping. And you can recharge it in the car after that.
- The fact that the LED makes such a concentrated light source makes it awesome for kids doing shadow theaters. I often put this light on the driveway in front of our garage, point the light towards the garage door and my son and the neighbor kids start jumping in front of it and play some situations. Soon they realize that whoever steps closer to the light casts the biggest shadow, whoever goes away of it, casts smaller shadow. One of them starts playing gozilla, and the others run back and forth trying to avoid being ""trampled"" by it.

My first light fell off the mount the other day, somewhere along my morning commute. I went back the route, but I couldn't find it any more (that hurt!). I ordered the same one. So please make sure you have it mounted properly to avoid this yourself.",More than just a biker's head light,True,
B00E1L78P4,3.0,"I do like the light.  A couple months after purchase, the light stopped charging.  Had to ship it back to NiterRider for fixing.  So they did fix it, so i give them credit for that.  My biggest drawback is that the light doesn't seem much brighter than my NiteRider 350.  I don't know if i just ended up getting a bad unit or what, but not sure if i'd recommend getting another one",I do like the light,True,
B00E1L78P4,4.0,"This is a very good light and well priced. I have gone through several bike lights with mixed results.
The neat thing about this lamp is how wide the light projects especially in dark areas. Also its rechargeable

B00E1L78P4,5.0,"This light is great, I was previously using a dinky little silicone strap-on light that wouldn't even light the ground in front of me, where i live there are no street lamps. It is darker than dark. This headlamp is brighter than both of my vehicles....no joke it's crazy bright. It is also easy to use. I only charge it when I commute to work, I just plug it right into my computer and charge it up with the USB charger. It is also extremely easy to operate (there's only one big button) every time you press it the brightness of the light will change 3x. FYI...I only use the lowest setting and it is more than bright enough, I have used this light for approx. 2 ears now, still running strong. I also misplaced the charging cable (which stays in my computer now at all times) I emailed Night Rider and they sent me a new one, No questions asked!, Now that's customer service! The thing that i love most about the light is how easy it comes off the handlebar once I make it to work, easy on easy off, intelligent design! I can't imagine using anything else.","This light is great, I was previously using a dinky little silicone ...",False,
B00E1L78P4,5.0,"This is a great light, but be careful not to aim it to high, or you will blind oncoming cyclists.  I found that I could quickly turn it slightly to the right when an oncoming cyclist was approaching on the trail, but I couldn't quickly turn it off.  Fortunately, the mounting hardware is easy to adjust, so you can simply lower it a bit if you are blinding folks.

I use this on my bike in addition to a Black Diamond Sprinter headlight on my head (slightly below my helmet), so that I can ""aim"" my head-based light at cars as needed.

This light takes a long time to recharge, so be sure to plan ahead.  But it's great that it's rechargeable, so you can always head out with a full battery.","Easy to install, nice and bright",False,

B00E1L78P4,4.0,"As many other, I use this light in my bike and during evening rides. the one-button control makes it easy to operate, even for folks like me that use gloves and has big hands!

The light it provides lets me see ahead and allows car drivers to see me coming. You need to work on aligning it correctly in your bike.

The only downside I see is that when is partially charged and you plug it for a full charge, it will take almost the same time to charges as if the battery were completely empty.",Easy to operate!,True,2
B00E1L78P4,5.0,Great head light. Wish I would have bought it several years ago. Very bright. Cars notice right away. Great safety feature. I bought it after noticing someone else had it.  We ride all of the time and usually leave early / low light in the morning to avoid traffic.  Highly recommend. Wish it had a battery charge indicator. That  would be my only complaint but wouldn't hesitate to buy again. So impressed I decided to go find a really good taillight as well.  I found the Lyzne Vector taillight  which I also like.  Great combination,Very nice head light,True,
B00E1L78P4,5.0,"I was a little leary of riding in the dark until I tried this unit.  It's very bright!  It has 3 settings, the dim is good most of the time and when you use the dim the battery is very long lasting.  I don't ride a lot at night, but I've had it a couple of months and used it at least once a week and only had to charge it a couple of times.",Bright and long lasting!,True,
B00E1L78P4,4.0,"If you are debating this light, stop and buy it.
The positives:
a) the mount works well and the light doesn't squeak in it when you ride like other lights (annoying after a while)
b) very bright and it does flash if you hold the button done.  Its really bright period.
c) most important to me: it does not interfere or blank out my heart monitor or cycle computer.  Many high lumen lights due this and you loose ride data.  Or you could be stupid like me and leave the light off so you could use the cycle computer.  After a couple close calls I tried this light.  Yea, the light and computer both work together and now I can ride safer.

The negatives:
a) not as compact and slick as my True 500 lumen light.  But like I said I couldn't use my True 500 with my Blackburn rear wireless cycle computer because t would interfere and black out all data.
b) you have to hold the button to go into flash mode as opposed to just pressing it to cycle between modes.
c)  mount barely fit my Cannondale, I had to remove the rubber liner.  Potential downside is that I might have removed a shock absorbing purpose of the liner inside the mount.

So bright, good battery life, mounts without squeaks and most importantly doesn't shut down/interfere with my cycle computer.  If this light had not worked I was going to get a wired computer, a ""digital"" wireless computer or upgrade to a Garmin GPS cycle computer for 300-400 dollars.",finally a light that does not interfere with my cycle computer,True,2

For the price you cant go wrong. Would highly recommend.",Very Bright!!!,True,
B00E1L78P4,5.0,"I purchased this light a few monts back and was waiting to see how it performs for the longer period.  I could have waited longer for a more accurate assessment of its longevity, but I liked this light so much that decided to put up my review now.  This is one bright monster light!  It is ideal for riding in pitch black conditions as it will provide enough light to your whole group.  I also purchased a car charger for charging the light in my truck during camping trips, and a wall charger for charging it in my garage.  The very first reactions coming from my fiends were ""WOW, its so bright""",One of the best in its class!,True,2
B00E1L78P4,2.0,"I would give this light 5 stars except for one thing - when it's cold, it does not maintain the claimed battery life.  Anytime the temp drops below 10 degrees, the battery life decreases by about 33%.  1 1/2 hours on high becomes 1 hour on high.  If I have to break trail through deep snow, which adds time to my normal commute, I've had the light automatically dim to save battery.  Not a big deal, but in Alaska, one always wants to see as far as one can - gotta avoid those moose and occasional brown bear on the trail, doncha know?

Other than that one thing, this is a fantastic light.  I haven't had any problems with the mounting bracket - as some have.  This is my second unit from Nite Rider (still have a Lumina 500 as a spare), and both have worked as flawlessly as I could have liked.

REVIEW UPDATE - dropping to two stars:
Bought the light on12/22/2013, and as of 1/20/2014, the light is dead.  Plugged it in to charge, and at first the charging indicator light would not turn on.  Jiggled things a bit, then the charge indicator light lit up.  But, the unit would not charge.  Indicator light stayed red all day.  Unplugged, tried to turn on the light, and it's dead.  Now the charge indicator won't light up either.  I will contact Nite Rider via phone tomorrow for a return authorization, and a request for refund.  I'm looking for a better light.

REVIEW UPDATE II - Have to say Nite Rider customer service is top notch.  I called their number, got hold of a real person on the first call, and they sent a brand new light with a pre-paid return label for the broken light.  The whole transaction took one week, which is superb. The new light works as it should, and very soon I won't need to use a light - long summer days in Alaska!",4 Stars with a caveat - now two stars . . . read on,False,13
B00E1L78P4,5.0,I daily commute about 15 miles and the way home is typically in the dark.  This light performs well and the battery life is spot on.  I use the flashing mode during the day as it is quite bright and may be too much for nighttime use (I had a driver cover her face at a stoplight to shield her eyes from the blinking before I realized how bright it was).  At night I typically use the low setting on streets with decent streetlights and then the rest of the way I use a mostly unlit beach bike path.  The low is fine for lighting up the path most of the time but for the faster or bumpier/sandier sections I use the medium or high setting for better vision. I don't think you'd need much more light for bike paths or commuting etc.  Mountain biking I could see the need for more light or maybe a helmet mounted light as well but this alone would do adequately.,Bright and good battery.,True,2
B00E1L78P4,5.0,"For the money this light is awesome!
Strobe: Easily visible in daylight, nearly blinding at night (but who uses a strobe at night?)
Walk mode:  Roughly as bright as my crappy old bike light.  Lights up about 10 ft in front of you, usable on walks and really slow rides/when you take it off the bike and use it to look at your lock combo.
Low:  Easily useable as a bike headlight on slower rides.  My personal favorite mode for off-bike use.
Medium:  Where I leave it when I'm riding usually.  Lasts longer than you can bike at any significant pace almost guaranteed.  Bright, good light pattern.
High:  HOLY MOTHER OF...... IS THAT THE SUN?!?!",An Excellent light for the money and Versatile enough for any ride.,True,7
B00E1L78P4,4.0,"Well made light. good light pattern and plenty bright.
My only complaint id that the flash mode is on high. That's great for broad daylight, but in twilight is is blinding to oncoming drivers. I've had several vocal complaints. It would be nice to have two flash settings or a pulse while the light is on setting for low light high traffic areas.
I really like the light, and for commutes and light off road, you won't need any more light than this sucker puts out. It also has good side to side visibility, lighting the road to about 45 degrees on each side.",Well made light. good light pattern and plenty bright.,True,
B00E1L78P4,5.0,Amazing! This is just like strapping a car headlight on your bike. I do a lot of riding during night time on roads without any street lights and my old like would only light up about 10 feet in front of me at best and is still hard to see what's on the ground. This light gives me at least 60 feet and I can see every little rock and hazard in my path.

B00EIWU2FE,1.0,"So, let me start off by stating that this waist trimmers do make you sweat.
Just don't expect it to make you miraculously drop inches off of your waist and stay that way.

Waist trimmers are designed to help you sweat out the water that your waist is retaining, but once you start drinking water again, your waist will revert back to normal. I purchased this item with the intent of making me look extra lean post-workout, which it did. But shortly after becoming re-hydrated, I was back to my normal size.
For those that are expecting this to be a magic cure that will help you blast inches of fat off your waist, this is not it. Nor is any product on the market, despite marketing claims. However, I could see this item being used as a weight-loss tool, along with a proper diet and exercise. This, to me, is a product that can motivate others to go to the gym as a) it will make you sweat, thereby making you feel you were productive at the gym and b) will let you see ""fast results"", despite being temporary. However, those immediate results will encourage people to go to the gym and embrace a healthier lifestyle altogether.
The low stars is primarily due to the rash I developed after use. For whatever reason, the interior of the belt just does not seem to agree with my sensitive skin.",Makes you sweat BUT your waistline will revert back to normal,True,4

B00EIWU2FE,4.0,"I like it alot. Only been using a few days so far and I can tell it makes my abdomen sweat a lot more than without it. Now, is it a magic loose weight solution...no. You still have to workout and eat right.

What I don't like is the huge yellow sweet sweat logo. It is a bit cheesey for my tastes and looks silly if I run with it on without a shirt. There are similiar waist bands that don't use bright huge logos. But I got this one so gonna stick with it and color the yellow lettering a with black marker. I also ordered the sweat sweet gel. I suspect you may could get alternatives to work just as well.

Overall its a helpful aid in targeting the stubborn belly fat. But remember diet and exercise are ultimately the only ways to trim stubborn fat.

Cheesey logo is annoying and I wish the band was a little wider (yes I purchased the one suggested for my waist size.)",Good for assistance targeting stubborn abdomen,True,5

B00EIWU2FE,4.0,So I bought this product based on other peoples reviews. I've had it for awhile now and forgot all about it (out of site out of mind). I finally went to the gym today and OMG! I could tell my midsection was warmer than the rest of my body.. dah. i have a belt around my waist. I can't find the lotion that came with it so it was all my sweat... and OMG there was a TON of it. I took the belt off at the gym and the sweat was everywhere.. in mass amounts where the belt was on my body and all over the belt. I had to wipe off my torso so my shirt wouldn't get all gross (didn't see sweat on shirt before I took it off) and I wiped off the belt as best as I could.  I came home and washed it with bath soap in the shower and laid it out to dry.  The side that goes against your skin is like a neoprene.

Sweet Sweat neoprene has little grooves in the side that comes in contact with your body. It helps hold the bands to your body and hold A LOT of sweat while you work out. I take them off in the bathroom in the shower or over my tub because the sweat will run off of you. I have ONLY been using them with the Sweet Sweat body butter, because the difference is amazing.

B00EIWU2FE,4.0,"I have no idea if this actually works, but I will say it definitely makes you sweat!!! I did notice it makes you engage your core more when you're working out/doing cardio because it heats you up so much so you notice those muscles more and what they're doing. If it does work, that's how it does... not because it makes you sweat.

I like this, I wear it under my shirt when I go running so I engage my core more and get a little more out of my workout by sweating more. I guess for $19 I can't complain, whether it works or not you might as well try it and see! I'm sure it will work for some and won't for others.. just depends on how you use it, and if you're also watching your diet.",Helps you engage your core during workouts!,True,

I workout every day and wore this with my workouts, nothing. I could seriously have used plastic wrap and got better results. Maybe it's for people who have more weight to lose?

I find that sometimes about halfway through a long workout I have to go readjust/tighten it for some reason, which is annoying, but I'm sure it is directly related to my increased sweat, which is the whole purpose. And you do sweat. Buckets. Use sweet sweat with it and you'll never turn back. Also, make sure to hang it to dry after you use it so it didn't get musty and smelly. I hang mine over my bathtub at home so that if it drips, it's okay. Actually, I take it off over the bathtub too. That's how much sweat it creates. It's definitely bulky, though. You can completely tell I'm wearing it, even when I wear baggier shirts to the gym.

The 2nd thing, I don't think the trimmer is long enough, I wanted the lower belly covered by the belt. So, unfortunately I bought another to compensate for that flaw design.

I have enjoyed the additional sweating so I like to continue using this waist trimmer.  Sadly, the dye in this belt runs horribly.

I used to wash it and let it drip dry in my shower until it stained my shower (leading to an hour of scrubbing on my knees to get it out) -  but now I let it hang dry with an old towel sitting under it to keep it from staining anything else.

Big butt, yes, Big hips, yes,  but I have always been proud of my small waist and flat stomach, and have been pretty good about diet and exercise, at least enough to keep me in the same size 6-8's for the last 35 years.

I was a little reluctant at first but after using the wrap I was impressed.  It really made me sweat extra!  I wore it during all cardio sessions towards the last 6 weeks of my prep.  There was a small sample of the Sweet Sweat enhancer and I only used it once.  It was very thick and hard to wash off.  It did heat up well though.  I usually train clients after my workout and a quick rinse off didn't get the enhancer off easily.  I'm not sure I would purchase the enhancer but the belt is great.  When I would remove the belt after teaching spin class the sweat would pour off of me.  One day my pants got soaked from it leaking out but you couldn't tell by looking at me.  My waist did get smaller as I used it.  However, at that time my eating habits and workouts were very structured.  The belt will not work if you aren't watching what you put into your mouth.

It did not make me feel immediately skinnier, like some reviewers said. Thats silly. Nothing works that fast. But, it did make me feel like I targeted my belly area and thats awesome.

I give this five stars because it did what it said. It made me sweat like crazy, it heated up my stomach and it targeted that problem area, all without any ill effects.

When I wear it on my pooch I've got muffin top and when I wear it high, my pooch spills under the bottom.

B00EIWU2FE,1.0,"Beware of all these 5 star reviews!! I am a Certified Personal Trainer & I personally like to use this type of belt for a little support (lifting belts are just too much). I also do like the extra water release without having to do the sauna. I have used many of these kind of belts & many are horrible and THIS IS RIGHT THERE in that horrible category. Here is why:
1) THIS BELT HAS A GOD AWFUL SMELL THAT NEVER GOES AWAY!! It strong smell of SKUNK & I am not exaggerating at all. I have tried absolutely everything and that smell never goes away or fades. It literally makes all my clothes smell of skunk & even the area I would hang it to dry after i wash it smell! So even if this belt was great in every way, that smell is a complete deal breaker. YES IT IS THAT OFFENSIVE & this alone makes me question all the 5 star ratings unless of course they all have no sense of smell!
2) The belt claims to be 8"" wide but that is not accurate at all. It is 9"" (yes i used a tape measure to give an accurate size). So you ask.. why does that matter? Well it matters a lot because not everyone is built the same e.g., some people have longer torsos & some have a shorter torso. A 9"" is way to wide for a person with a short torso and would make it very uncomfortable to sit. Any good waist trimming belt would have size options both how wide to fit the individual's toro & how long to fit the person with a small waist or larger waste. which brings me to the next issue.
3) I actually am fit & have a 30"" waist and this belt is way too long. So if you are about a 34"" waist or smaller, it is going to wrap around you too much. So the illustration of the Man & Woman who clearly are fit must have a custom belt because these belts are too long. If you are a man or woman with larger than a 34"" waist this is going to be good for you. Someone once said ""cut it"" which is a complete joke. If you buy clothes your not going to cut it to make it fit are you? They need to make sizes to fit all body types.

B00EIWU2FE,4.0,"Best quality waist belt out there!  I'm not sure it's making me lose weight but I sweat a lot.  I ordered a second one for better coverage starting at just below the breast line down to my hips.  I loved the sweet sweat belt so I bought a second belt (different  brand) at a local athletic store.  Same price, big difference in quality!  Sweet sweat had far better quality so I'll use the sub-par one until sweet sweat belt number 2 arrives.

The theory behind this is that it increases circulation.  Fat has very little blood flow.  The circulatory system in abdominal adipose tissue is mostly capillary, or those teeny tiny veins.  It would make sense that increased heat would dilate those tiny vessels, increase circulation and in turn increase the body's ability to decrease fat in the targeted area.

B00EIWU2FE,5.0,"First of all, I want to make sure everyone knows that this is NOT a corset or waist trainer and should not be used as one. This is a waist trimmer meant to shed excess water and improve circulation in the area, imitating a sauna of sorts. The Sweet Sweat trimmer is made of neoprene and so is not meant to be worn for longer than a period of two hours. Trust me, you won't even need that much time to work up a crazy sweat! It was a little crazy to see how much when I first removed the belt.

The trimmer belt is very self-explanatory, and I love that it came with a sample of Sweet Sweat's workout enhancer cream. You rub the cream on problem areas to improve circulation, increase sweating, and aid in recovery. I put it on my belly and sides before wrapping the belt around myself. It was very easy to fasten since it is just a thick strap of velcro that stays put and doesn't budge.

I tried it for the first time at my house to just walk around in for a few minutes while doing chores. I did indeed feel some support in my back, but I prefer to train my core and back to support my spine better instead. After only 5 minutes I already felt my tummy area getting warmer, but I had to get to work so I removed it for the time being. After coming back from work I rubbed in the Sweet Sweat cream, wrapped the belt around and went outside to do a quick rope jumping circuit. One unexpected benefit of this belt is that it helps keep my pants from falling too! Within 15 minutes my midsection was DRENCHED. I could definitely feel the difference between today and my other rope jumping sessions!

I'd like to add that nothing is a substitute for exercise and eating healthy, whole foods. You cannot simply wear the belt, eat bon bons for a month, and hope to lose 15lbs from your waist alone. You will have to put in the work, but it will absolutely be worth it! The belt helps you shed excess water weight in your belly region, so it is a wonderful thing to wear during a cardio session so that you can shred up a little more last minute. It also helps get rid of some of that jiggle you feel when jumping rope or running (which bothers me a ton!). I am thrilled to be able to test this product out for a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review**. I will also be purchasing the Sweet Sweat cream for a little extra oomph in my sweat sessions!

I have taken my photos for Day 1 of using the belt. I will be snapping a few every couple days to monitor my progress with this belt, and am excited to see the final product!

B00EIWU2FE,4.0,"I really like, I actually ended up returning it because I felt like I couldn't get it tight enough on my waist, but the belt I replaced it with made me realize how much better Sweet Sweat Waist Trimmer is. The material it's made out of is sooo much better, it's much more comfortable and way more effective! I made a big mistake by returning it.

B00EIWU2FE,5.0,good,Five Stars,True,
B00EIWU2FE,5.0,"Much of what motivates buyers to purchase a product stems from owner/user reviews. Which is why I believe it is imperative for people to actually use an item to its fullest intent *prior to* posting ones' experience (it's only fair to give an honest review). That said, this is my 4th ""Sweet Sweat"" Waist Trimmer Belt since I began using it a year ago. Why so many you ask? Because on average, I workout 5 days a week at least 2 hours. I Deadlift 350lbs, Squat 225lbs and Bench 205lbs (not bad for a Girl).

Wearing the ""Sweet Sweet Belt"" gives pretty good back support for me while performing each of these exercises and more. With such a rigorous powerlifting routine it seems that over time the internal heating component fades (from my experience). But believe this, ""Sweet Sweat"" lives up to its promise -- so when the ""belt"" is removed (especially AFTER an intense workout), it is full of excess water from the front of those abs around to your back. Wearing the belt also helps to ""naturally"" suppress your appetite. In other words, if you have the belt wrapped tight enough (caution: do not cut off your circulation) you tend eat far less as you feel fuller quicker. Additionally, the ""Sweet Sweat Belt"" assists the wearer with having a more erect posture.

Now for the good part, coupled with reduced sugar intake (other nutritional adjustments), increased weight training and 8 to 10 hours sleep -- I've lost  roughly 6inches off of the waist (Yippee). Somethings I would like to see improved with this belt is for the company to make it in Wide. Despite how much area it covers on the package-model (truth be told) it DOES NOT eliminate that muffin top for those who have a little more belly-fat.

Inquiring Minds Want To Know:
(1) People ask, do you wear the belt when not exercising? Yes. However, I try not to keep it on longer than 2 hours.
(2) People ask, do you machine wash the belt? No. I don't want to destroy the heating element. Thus, I simply wipe off and air dry.
(3) People ask, do you use the cream w/ the belt? No. I need to hear from others users who use it and hear their results before trying.
(4) People ask, what made you select this brand? I did massive research and ""SSWTB"" had the most honest reviews (some w/ pics).
(5) People ask, do you use their other products? I have not, but would LOVE to try the thigh trimmers.
(6) People ask, do you recommend this company and why? Absolutely yes because the product works. It has been a beneficial tool in my fitness program.

**These are questions asked by real people who expressed genuine curiosity about the product and ultimately purchased the belt. All of which are very satisfied with their results.

FINAL WORD: You should know that the belt is not magic. You are still responsible for incorporating a fitness and nutritional plan that will help reduce or maintain your ideal weight. As for losing inches around the waist with this belt. It is equally important to be aware that perspiration from the body is water weight only. Users should have realistic goals and not expect the Waist Belt to make your belly fat shrink simply from wearing it. You will need to put in some physical labor to vanish those love-handles. Sweet Sweat Waist Trimmer Belt is merely a tool.

It is very comfortable and easy to adjust. I have no problem with bunching or bending when I wear it (which is about 14 hours a day at work and home).

B00F42IUU6,5.0,"I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase. The lower price, compared with some other units made me a bit skeptical. But, for home use or family use, this repair stand is a great bargain. Great features include a small trays with a magnetic surface to keep small items like nuts and screws from being lost during repair projects. The four point stand makes the unit extremely stable. For more permanent installations the feet are pre drilled for screws or bolts to attach the unit to the floor.","Great Value - Low Price, Good Quality, Great Functionality",True,
B00F42IUU6,4.0,"this stand is very similar to the RAD and the Conquer Portable Home Bike Repair Stand, which was no longer available at amazon.  Lucky for me it wasn't available; this one cost less!
This stand has the metal quick release on the clamp!
The tool tray was simple to put on; the stand was easy to put together; it comes with a hex head wrench.
I had my bike up on it in less than an hour holding it first by the seat post then by the top tube and it held well. There was a little movement when I was releasing the tires so I straightened the bike out. I was leery of making the clamp too tight and breaking it but... I did tighten it some more.
I just bought a new bike and will be assembling it on the stand in about a week.
I am really happy with the purchase; I was going to attempt to make a stand out of PVC pipe but the price of the Confidence stand was hard to pass up. I think it would have cost the same or more to buy all the PVC pipe and fittings!

Addendum
I've had a hybrid up on this and did some spot-truing; the stand made it easy to do the work. I can raise, lower or re-clamp the bike either on the seat-post, top-tube or seat-tube. I usually try for the best center-of-gravity spot but sometimes the weight maybe to the front which the stand can tolerate, but I wouldn't overdue that on any portable stand.
I have placed my wife's cruiser on this stand just to see how it would handle the 39# and it was okay; just need something under the front tire to hold it at level. The adjusting handlebar rod works fine to hold the front tire straight!
I assembled a road bike(24#) I purchased online on this stand recently; it already had the rear wheel/tire, rear brake, cassette, crankset and stem attached. I had to assemble onto the bike the handlebars, front brake caliper, pedals and front wheel; I adjusted the stem/headset, derailleurs, all cables and shifted gears while spinning the pedals. So, tuning a bike is relatively simple on the stand. I could clamp the bike at the seat tube, seat post or top tube; the top tube gave a better center of gravity; the bike could be tilted or the height could be dropped. I don't know how much torque you plan to apply but, I am sure that if you counter torque, the stand will do.
Also the adjustable handlebar rod is a plus!

Addendum II:
I had some problems with the leg assembly quick release clamp; the bolt head started to turn inside the plastic clamp; First I drilled a hole in the plastic to try to hold the bolt head with a screw; no good! I then used vise grips on the outside of the plastic clamp to hold the bolt head; I was able to remove it and place a washer on the bolt to keep it on the outside of the hole and I can use a 10 mm wrench to hold it if needed. So, I dropped my rating to a 4 star. Maybe Confidence should rectify the problem... I will contact the company!

still works & handles bikes well; I place a small portion of an old tube in top clamp to hold the jaws more securely & also made a sling from an old tube to place around the jaws to hold the red rubber securely; ||||----||||; still a good buy",Holds my bikes well!

The product is mostly metal, but the clamp parts have orange plastic covers on them (possibly to not scratch the bike). The plastic works OK, except that it often gets loose and you have to push it back on (an occasional annoyance), but for the price this is not a big issue and may be solved with some glue.

The product also comes with nice extras like a handy tool tray and handle bar stabilizer. I like the tool tray a lot, but the handle bar stabilizer is super annoying to put on. Basically, there's a rubber strap with holes in it, and a plastic round knob that you have to get the rubber strap over to secure it. I found that the rubber holes can be super annoying/difficult to get over the plastic knobs, it is doable, but a Velcro system would work TONS better.

Very sturdy even if you don't open up the 4 legs up all the way, and I have an older steel frame Mt bike on it and it holds it with no problem. The clamps are plastic, but you really don't have to crank down on these things to hold the bike on the stand, even when you crank it over and run through the gears. I did put some peel and stick thin rubber on the inside of the adjustable clamp. I dare say, you could probably hang 2 bikes on this stand,one on the other side if it was possible, with no problem.

B00F42IUU6,5.0,"I think this stand is the best stand for the money. I have posted a handful of pics along with this review. This stand is fairly light for its size. approx. 10lbs.-15lbs. The pics show the stand holding my bike by the down tube(cylindrical) and the top tube(elliptical). it held the bike without difficulty in both configurations. I adjusted the position of the legs as well. the pic with the legs drawn in indicates the point that the stand would stay balanced while working on my bike. u do need a good 3 - 4 sq.ft. to fully extend the feet but even with the legs fully extended they don't seem to get in the way. I have only done minor adjustments so far. but I have only owned it for a week now. it folds up quite nicely. the little red rubber tabs on the bike clamp would be improved by coating it all in a thick layer of rubber compound but it doesn't lose a star for it. at this price I can apply a little contact cement, or buy some rubber compound myself if it becomes a bother. check out the pics. they should answer most of the questions u may have. the red knob that locks down the clamp arm is my biggest concern. if something fails I feel it will be that. if so I will update this review.
  I would definitely recommend this stand to those looking for the average bike stand at a good price.","Flexible, and Stable!",True,
B00F42IUU6,3.0,"Good sturdy stand. Much bigger than i thought it was. Arrived quickly. A few issues that  cant really be complained about for the price. One, the cushions on the clamp are not fixed, just pressed on probably by hand  and do not stay on under clamping pressure. I had to glue them and clamp them amd now they seem to be there for good. Two, the arm the clamp is on slides into a plastic ring assembly  on the main  body. The arm is smoothish metal, and the ring is smooth plastic. It tighetens with one or two hex screws that mate up with hex nuts in hex recesses on the other side in a raised tab. Be careful with the nuts, they will fall  out if you aren't careful and you could lose them, and not be able  to  tighent the ring. It might  be  a  good  idea  to  glue them in place. But, it doesnt tighten down enough to hold the bike in position at any point other than the bikes balance point. The fix for this is this: shimming. You could use inner tube, but the tolerance is pretty tight and it might not fit amd even if it does, it might bite through the rubber, defeating your purpose. I bought plumbimg Teflon  tape and Duck brand self fusing repair tape. I tried the repair tape  first and it has seemed to work so far, it gives a little, but held a 30 lb dumbell solid with me torqing it and im big and strong. The clamp is plastic amd honestly, i wouldnt give it a lot of sun, it might get brittle on you. The quick releases are a little coarsely threaded, making adjusments effective but tricky. The steel is sturdy and the legs are stable at various extensions and at the fullest  they are wide, but unobtrusive. Dont drop anything  on them or step or stand on them, they may warp or break easily. The feet fold flat for balancing and flip up for storage. The clamp hace a little bit of side to side play in it and the retaining screw doesnt tighten down enough  to take up the slop, but i don't know of this will be a problem.  The stand is rated to 66 lbs, i think it will handle that, but of there is a breakage, it will the in the clamp, or the ring that hold it on the body as both are structurally  plastic of some sort. I would not put much more that in it. This says portable, and if you plan to move it by car, it will fit in all but the smallest trunks or back seats, but the fix for the shifting clamp arm basically makes the clamp arm unremovable, so if you do it that way, ot womt fit in as small a space as if you could take it out. The handlebar stabilizer arm is the lowest quality part of  this and even then, its pretty  good, but should be cared for and not subjected to stess as it will bend or break  easily. The straps that allow it to attach to something  work  but the holes that slip around the stud on the other side of the endcap are a little bit stiff, so reaming them out to loosen  them just a little bit will ease their use. Its probably  easier  and better to load the stand by parking the bike in front of it, then lower the clamp down to the top tube, seat tube or post, or the down tube (probably not the best way to hold a bike in this stand, too top heavy unless you have it inverted) , then put the bike in the clamp, then tighten it moderately, then lift the bike  off the ground with your back to the bike and the clamp arm on your shoulder (if you have a heavy bike, if not you can just lift it, or load it in the clamp with it where you want it),  so you can tighten  the quick release clamp to hold the rising arm at the height  you want it. This is perhaps a little easier than trying to put the bike in the clamp and tighten it, since the clamp can require two hands since it is sprinf tensioned  and it is counter tightened with a wing nut.  As far as working on a bike on it, you should take care not to over torque things while the bike is on the stand suspended. You should  break bolts loose before you have it in the stand, then load it, do what you need to do, finger tighten, remove and apply finishing torque on the ground. This is simply because of the plastic clamp and ring issues. Its not a park tool or topeak or pedros, but you aren't paying even half of what those cost, if you need heavy duty and three sigma engineering, you should expect to pay for that, this isn't  that, this is a budget basic work stand and thats the price you are  paying. One more thing,  the tool tray is a sorta nice touch but even at this price, it could have been better done. It is two pieces, main tray body with a magnet (small, good for keeping screws where you want them, but not much more than that) and a bracket that holds it to the stand by clampimg it to the main member. The bracket attaches with two hex screws. The threading is so fine it takes about two and a half weeks to screw or unscrew them with the thankfully supplied hex driver. A simple spring tensioned  clamp would make more sense with something that is supposed to be portable, but the tray is a half moon, so it's  possible  to loosen the screws to let it rotate around and let the stand lay flat for transport of storage. The stamd will also store easily under a bed or other higher standing furniture, or a closet or corner.
 If you want to solve the clamp arm rotation  problem without making the arm permanently attached to the stand i just figured out  a way to do that. Get the larger  work clamps you use for holding glued pieces together the kind that have a screw or trigger  tightening mechanism and one clamp arm is fixed  and the other slides along a long rail. Tighten one clamp onto the stands clamp arm on the end that sticks out of the ring after you insert it through. The rail should be on the side that you are trying to prevent motion in. Using another or two other clamps tightly around  the stands vertical  main main tube so that the rail or rails brace the rail from the first, preventing it from rotating.  This will allow you  to use  the stand and not have to worry about the bike roating. Hope this iI'ms helpful

 Update 6-24-16. Reducing to three after using the thing. Its sturdy, and the base is stable. The clamp though renders unusabale.

The only downside is the clamp stem is only held by a friction bolt.  Most other stands have a stepping tooth system for that joint which enable you to pick the position and know it will stay.  This means that if you don't clamp the bike at the center of balance - or if you do something to change the center of balance (like take off a wheel) there's a good chance the bike is going to swing accordingly.

That's right, we've gone to the moon, we've split the atom, we can talk face to face to people on the other side of the planet...we can even make legs for people with no legs enabling them to run faster than people with friggin legs... yet we can't get a kick stand on a rear suspension bicycle.

So this bike, which was far more expensive than the Huffy junk, gets thrown on the ground when I'm not riding it, while Huffy junk gets a kick stand.

So being the stubborn crazy guy I am, I went ahead and ordered this, as my deranged brain couldn't process the idea that mankind is still too primitive to get a kick stand to work on this bike.

And behold!  It turns out humanity HAS advanced to this level!

Can time travel be far off?

I snugged this down near the rear axle, and that was that.  No adjustments were needed, though you can extend the arm out.

Now, my bike is a bit heavy.  I have a rack, a bag on the rack, a lock, lights, a heavy child seat, and of course me.  This means it is not quite as stable on the stand as, say, a stripped down beach cruiser.

It's plenty stable for my uses, which is to keep me from having to lean my bike against stuff or throw it on the ground.

It's solid, it doesn't come down unless you put it down, it looks good, and it's cheap.

She desperately wanted a kick stand so that day we came home and searched amazon. This kick stand stuck out the most because of the color to match her bike and because it said it would fit a ""26"" inch bike which hers is. I actually was hesitant to order it based on what happened at the bike shop so I held off for a few days and continued my search. Afterwards, we came back to this one. Praying it would fit, we ordered it. IT FITS!!! Super easy to install and super quick too. Its adjustable to the height she desires.

The height adjustment allows it to fit any bike too. I pull a trailer that my daughter rides in and it's strong enough to hold up my bike and the weight of my daughter in the trailer.

B00FIKIK7C,4.0,"This kickstand is perfect for bikes with oblong chain stays and disk brakes. Mine has worked well. It stays out of the way of the pedals, so you can walk your bike backwards (great if you store your bike in a narrow spot) and spin your pedals backward (helps for lubing your chain).
  The one problem I've had is with the set screw which holds the lower part of the leg. It loosens, and the leg can actually slide off. After using it almost everyday for the past two years, I just lost the bottom and had to order a new kickstand. I modified my new kickstand by drilling a hole in the sliding track and used a longer screw which locks the leg at the length I need. this should fix it, but this is a serious flaw with the design of this product.

Sometimes it is difficult to build something simple but have it be perfectly functional.

My only glitch, though very minor, is that my bicycle has disc brakes so has a cable running along the same area where this is to be installed.  The bicycle has a notch moulded into the frame to hold the cable... and this notch is exactly where I want to place the kickstand.  It won't fit behind the notch so must go in front. Because it is so close, when peddling, my foot (heel) occasionally touches the kickstand mounting bracket.  Doesn't cause any problems, I'll just have to remember to keep my foot away from the inner side of the pedal.  Please note, this is a very minor annoyance and is no fault of the kickstand but rather, where the bike manufacturer chose to put the cable-mounting notch.  Still 5 stars for the kickstand.

We use the Weehoo daily and the kickstand is routinely in use. It feels very sturdy

B00FIKIK7C,3.0,"Let me start by saying that the kickstand works - so if that is your main interest/question I'd suggest picking one up.  The one I received had the end threads stripped on the screw that allows for height adjustment.  I opted to not return in and instead bought a replacement at the local hardware store.  The other aspect I was not thrilled with was the weight.  While clearly not an issue for someone into bicycle racing (as they would never have a kickstand installed) the weight was still more than I would expect.

So yes - it fit and will fit a variety of different bikes.  Manufacturing could use a bit more in the QA process (though I would suspect by the design that the end of the adjusting screw will strip often).

It doesn't seem to rattle and is well constructed.

It is a sturdy looking, light weight kickstand that supposedly would fit bikes from 20"" to 26"". After putting the new bike together, I mounted the kickstand, in it's fully retracted configuration, only to find that it was too long. This is why I deducted a star. However, I was able to easily fix that problem by, loosening the adjusting screw, removing the sliding foot portion, and cutting about an inch off the top of it.

Had I known quite how large it was, I probably would have chosen to order something of a bit smaller size, but this certainly gets the job done. One qualm I do have with the product is that on the middle part of the stand, there is a large red circle that totally destroys the sleek black appearance of the product. I simply fixed it with a bit of Sharpie marker and some reflective tape. Other than that, however it is excellent in all regards. Most of the construction is metal and it fits my Giant Defy exactly where a kickstand should go. There were no directions included, but unless you're particularly dense, you should have no problem with installation.",Best kickstand for <$15,True,
B00FIKIK7C,3.0,"I bought this for my Diamondback Trace Sport bike due to the normal Greenfield kickstand not fitting.  I suspected cutting out that small cross-bar between the two rear forks would allow the Greenfield to fit but doing so would not only uglify the bike but may also compromise it's integrity.  I'm no professional biker, but I do cause a lot of stress to various parts of this bike when I'm busy falling off or trying to attach it to a bike rack with the absurdly large chain I bought for fear of bike theft.

This bike stand does fit, but you have to jam it all the way against the rear disk brake attachments to get it in a position where it does not bend the cable that feeds the brakes.  Alternatively you could un-clip the brake cable and put it closer to the pedals but then you run the risk of kicking it with your giant clown shoes.  I have large 12"" feet and in a normal full pedal stroke I don't hit this with my heal.  However, if i put my toes on the pedals like a wierdo and pedal I will feel the heal of my foot brush up against it.  So be warned, it's not a 100% perfect fit.  However, after biking around a few weeks with no kickstand and leaving my expensive bike leaning against things while everyone else props their city bikes up by kickstands I decided to give it a try and it worked.

My Gary Fisher mountain bike has a flattened bottom tube on the rear forks, so I didn't think I would have trouble getting this installed tightly - several reviews mentioned that it didn't work well with round tubes.  In reality, it was looser than I wanted - it had some play to it.  I could have lived with that, but what did me in is then the bolt for adjusting height of the stand sheared off while I was tightening it.

B00FIKIK7C,2.0,"I have a Tranz X Adjustable kickstand on my other bike that has worked brilliantly (after gluing the arm into a fixed length), so I thought this beefier product would be even better. Sadly, I will be ordering another Tranz X to replace this disappointing product.

The main problem is that there is nothing to brace the kickstand in place, so no matter how tightly you clamp it to the chainstay it always ends up being forced by the weight of the bike to slip out away from the bike, resulting in growing lean until the bike collapses. Obviously, this makes the kickstand useless.

Also, though, the internal screw threads (on the one I received, at least) in one of the three through taps didn't take the screw well, causing the screw to break apart about 1/4 of the way through. It was then impossible to remove the broken screw. One of the other through taps requires excessive force, but isn't quite as bad.

I'm giving two stars instead of one because I imagine if the through taps were threaded properly there wouldn't be an issue in that regard, and I imagine that if a bike's chainstay were flatter than round near the rear hub, the kickstand MIGHT not swing out away from the bike.

B00JK8LVXI,5.0,"Out of the box it looks like a very well thought out designed and feels solid. I like the handle which allows you to hold the pack by itself, without a backpack (may come in useful). Also the detachable hose is cool for maybe sharing with others if you order a replaceable tube/with valve. I don't think I will use the insulated straw because it is not much insulation, and it's black which will absorb the sun's heat. Maybe I will try it, but I think the clear color of the straw will attract less heat.

The water tastes AMAZING. I can't believe I sipping from plastic tastes clean. I Googled the manufacturer they are listed as TSI Manufacturing LLC, and they use Metallocene which they claim is the same material used in medical products being stronger than plastic and safer, but I can't find any current research to back that up, but it sounds good. (I am not gonna bike with a GLASS bottle no matter what, so this this will have to do).

TROUBLESHOOTER - NO SUCTION (as they do not come with any, and I had to figure this out on my own): The one thing I would point out is that there is a lock on the valve head that needs to be released to allow flow. I didn't know at first, and was sucking and biting but nothing came out. Finally I saw a tiny arrow on the back of the valve head pointing up, and it said ""ON"". I  tried moving it up with my thumb but wouldn't budge, and I was afraid it would snap. I then pushed it up against the edge of my desk and it opened. After that everything works good, and did not have any issues locking or sliding up the lock, it was only the first time. I guess it was too dry inside there, but it lubricated after sucking through the water.

GREAT PRICE and FAST SHIPPING. I Highly recommend to anyone looking to replace your current disgusting nauseating bladder.

B00K8DAIUQ,5.0,"The poles arrived in short order.  They were well packed and had all the necessary screws and hardware.

The actual ""installation"" is done with a single Phillips head screwdriver, one drill bit, and a lead pencil.

The first step is to drill and screw in the pole fixtures that hold the poles to the boat.  Line them up to face
the same direction, mark the hole, and screw into the poles.  Having put these four pieces on the pole ends, you now move to
the four pieces that attach to the boat, and to the bimini frame.  Insure the boat deck/rail attachments are the ones with a flat
bottom and the bimini frame attachments are the ones with a curved bottom.

Boat installation was a snap.  I determined what pole angle would put the top where I wanted it to be stored in an upright
position, marked the holes with a lead pencil, and installed the bottom of the pole to the boat in five minutes with a cordless drill.

That was the hard part.  Then I placed the other end of the poles against the bimini frame, marked the holes, and drilled it.

After attaching the last screws to the bimini top, I was done and it works just fine.  There are no moving parts to the support
poles, so it should last for as long as you need it.

I immediately searched on Amazon for a softer seat cover. There were many options and they all had mixed reviews. I took a chance on this Topcabin seat cover.

I figured I couldn't go wrong because this cover was so cheap. If it was terrible I wouldn't have wasted much money and I would simply buy another. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The description labels the seat as having memory foam. I do not believe that the material inside the seat is memory foam, it feels too rigid to be memory foam. I do not believe it makes a difference though. The seat is still much more comfortable with this seat cover.

The Eceen pack will hold 1/2 gallon of water, store several devices, and it comes with a 7 watt solar panel and a 10,000mAh external battery pack. While the Eceen Solar Pack will work for a hiker it may not have the ultra-tough shell, or the internal storage space, for long range hikes (especially in brush).

Notes-

- Has an internal water bladder that can hold 1.8 liters of water (1/2 gallon). The water bladder fills very easily, and the water comes out very easily.

- The solar panel provides up to 7 watts of power - the solar panel does work even on cloudy days (although it will take longer to charge devices).

- Another feature is that the Eceen Solar Backpack also comes with an 10,000mAh external battery pack. This is a very nice feature because it allows you to charge your devices directly from the battery (which will charge a typical smart phone 3 or 4 times) while you slowly charge the external battery from the solar panel.

- The back is a bright teal blue - and is somewhat reflective on the back of a cyclist (or hiker).

- The marterial on the Eceen is a thin nylon - ideal for a cyclist but it may not likely hold up for a serious hiker.

- Space for all of the things you need for a day long trip - but it is not designed for anyone who needs an overnight backpack (which is true for almost all camelback style backpacks).

- The pack is comfortable and is easily adjustable.

Final verdict - The Eccen Solar Backpack is combines the a camelback type water pack with the ability to charge devices on the go. While 7 watts of power will take a considerable amount of time to charge your device the Eceen also comes with a 10000mAh external battery pack that can be used for an immediate charge. Anyone looking for a small camelback type of backpack may want to consider the Eceen solar pack for the combination of water and a solar charger!

B00NFD3D8A,5.0,"I received the backpack and just checking it out it seems pretty sturdy.  I love the idea of the solar charger, hydration pack and the ability to store my laptop which is 12 inches and fits nicely inside... although I'm hoping the material that separates the Hydration tank and this area is waterproof and never spills over. Not too worried because the hydration tank seems to have a pretty secure cap on it. I haven't had the opportunity yet to try out the solar panel and battery pack and I am so looking forward to it as spring has just begun. From what I've observed so far, I am tickled pink and quite happy. I will update my review once I have the opportunity to utilize the bag to it's full potential.

B00NFD3D8A,5.0,"I have to say i am thrilled with this little KICK BUTT bag!  I have tried several solar chargers, several power supplies several power banks and even the AMPY kinetic charger at ($990.  NOTHING compares to this solar panel and battery combo.  From Dead to fully charged for my iphone 5 the batter outputs 1/4 of the full charge.  I will be able to charge my phone completely 3/4 times per charge.  AMAZING.  The solar panel is light and flexible and can clip onto any bag.  We are section hiking the Appalachian trail and having a power source for the phone is a necessary evil.  I feel very confident with this new tool in out pack.

The bag is very well constructed, nice durable  material superb buckles hip strap and straps.
THE ONLY THING i can see reading other reviews is the USB on the battery is getting damaged  I can see that if you have the chord attached and force the battery plus chord into the zippered pouch on the back of the solar panel the pressure will eventually damage that connection.  the Zippered pouch could be about 1 inch longer to accommodate this but I can just live the pouch slightly unzipped to not damage the chord.

1. school chalk is very good for absorbing moisture and it coats well on your hand but it gave me a smoother feeling.. the bars won't slip but it was nice until the gym chalk entered my life.. gym chalk makes your palms a sticky.. super glue son of a gun thing.. 400 lbs people.. (never going back to school chalk ever)..

2. School chalk is a lot more dense then the gym chalk.. not that it matters..

3. This particular chalk crumbles real easy.. applying from the block on hands directly(i got all the blocks intact totally.. Thank you monster people for that) is a breeze.. coats on very well and you are setup in mere seconds (this also gives me time to go into the lifting zone.. if you know what i mean).. else knocking off a small piece of the block and crumbling it under your fingers to apply on the hands is really easy too..

4. damn awesome grip with the gym chalk.. it gives me a little extra to hold the bar in the same position that i wanted to from the beginning of a lift..

All in all.. worth its price anyday..",Super glue monster this.. bye bye sweaty palms..,True,6.0

I was a little doubtful that the capacity is four gallons but it is well over one gallon, very well made and perfectly suited to do what I intended.  This bag is about the size of a large shoe box and seems that it will last a long time.

The silver panels on the side are NOT reflective, but the piping is as well as the back pocket cover and light strap.

I wish there was another mounting strap on the bottom because there are only two and I worry a little, but it hasn't moved since I installed it so maybe that won't be an issue.

There is an elastic gathering on top of the wrist. I feel this should be a good fit to keep out cold air, but it was loose on me.  The Smartouch feature works only so so.

B00X5YNENI,5.0,"I just received these in the mail today and could not wait to review them! I have kinda square shaped hands with short fingers and wide palms. There are times I have difficulty getting gloves to fit properly but I needed a new pair so, I gave these a shot.

They are a combination of a super soft fleece like fabric with a sturdy nylon the tops of the knuckles and down the fingers and thumb back to the wrist. This should help avoid snags on the backs of the gloves. on the palm side the index, middle and thumb have a leather like covering. The inside is a very soft,  red fleece like fabric.

They're a close fit but not too snug. Easy to get on and off. They are flexible enough that I can type if I have to wearing them.

After trying out the fit I grabbed my smart phone. The touch feature works GREAT! I have another pair of gloves that are compatible with smart screen screen technology but they are not as responsive as these. Anywhere on the leatherette portion of the fingers and thumb seem to work with the screen.

If you have larger hands you may want to go a size up but I have always found Isotoner to sun a bit on the small size.

If you're searching for the perfect non leather gloves that work with your technology rather than against it look no further!

I doubt that I will use that feature often but it's nice to have if you need it.

Since it's August, I can't test them for warmth but will update this review after I've worn them in cold weather.  I wouldn't pay nearly $50 for these, however, and with the size discrepancy, can't recommend that anyone else does.

B00X5YNENI,2.0,"Right off, let me say that the reason for the low score is the sizing or mis-leading information about sizing. These were marked as ""women's Medium/Large"", but actually, they did not fit even my grown daughter who is tiny, wears a size 4 clothing. but these fit a 12 year old just fine. So the sizing is awful.

Aside from that, these are well made with good strong stitching, These were black with a red interior. They have a soft, breathable fleece fabric that traps heat for better warmth-the advertising says it provides 15% more warmth. The palm has a leather-like fabric over the base of the palm, thumb, and first two fingers to provide good grip-what they call ""smart touch technology"". On the back of the hand, the fabric changes again to a water resistant fabric.

I have medium size hands and I got the med/lg gloves. Although they are just a teeny bit snug, most gloves I buy do fit like that in the beginning. I expect these will loosen up after a few wearings, like most of my other ones have.

The reason I did not give five stars, is that the Smartouch feature is a bit cumbersome. For me, the Smartouch does not work at the very end of my finger tips. It does work using the fleshy (bottom part) of the end of my fingers. But it is a little hard to be precise that way. I honestly prefer the Smartouch gloves with he little disc at the end, as that works better for me personally. All in all though, a great pair of gloves.

I wore this around during playoffs and received several compliments (clearly not Panther fans ;).  The logo is nice, and the blue part of the arms has sort of a dark blue striped pattern - not just a complete solid.  You can sort of see it if you drill down in the photo.

It has a good amount of stretch to it without being really flimsy. It also doesn't become see through when it stretches. I don't use nose plugs or ear plugs so I'm not entirely sure how good they are, but they do seem well made.

B011HCCQY2,5.0,So let me first off say that I go camping at least twice a month. All my friends have hammocks that they bring with them and I always use them and I've always decided I should purchase one. I've been shopping around for the last couple months to the real big brand stores. I can't believe how inexpensive this hammock was compared to the one that the big brand store was well over $100. It took me less than 2 minutes to pull it out of the packaging and set it up and only took me about 4 minutes to put it back in the original bag it comes in which is attached to the hammock which is very convenient. Probably going to buy a few more for Christmas presents for my camping pals as now they're all jealous because of how big and spacious as far I weigh 280 pounds and it helped me absolutely gracefully no problem whatsoever.

B011HCCQY2,4.0,"This is a nice, light weight two person camping or back packing hammock.  I have tried a number of hammocks, some from various camping stores (Academy, Richards Sporting Goods, Camp World, etc.) and a wide range of prices  from this that I tried at a discount to $90 hammocks.  The truth is, the quality isn't much different  ever.  Occasionally there are better features, whether its high quality tree straps or mosquito nets, but the quality really isn't ever any different than any other time.

The price on this is a great point, the quality is good  the only thing I would say is that youll benefit from finding a good set of tree straps for it.  Look for the kind made out of seatbelt material.

One nice thing is that this is big enough to fully wrap around many adults when they're inside.  Thats a great way to keep reasonably dry while camping or back packing.

B011HCCQY2,5.0,"Definitely get one when they are available.  I'll be picking up another.  This hammock is big enough for two large adults. I have 5 hammocks and the Trail Quest is by far the biggest I own.

My daughter and I hung in it the whole day when we received it in the mail. Very quick delivery, got it in 2 days. Packaged nicely and had no rips, tears, or fraying.  Comes with a lifetime warranty! Doesn't come much better than that. It definitely made me grab one to try it out. I'm glad I did. I now have a hammock for every member of the family.  This one is big enough to hold a few of the kids friends.

Has a nice pocket attached to the hammock that works a a stuff sack. The pocket has clips attached so you can attach to just about anything while carried. It definitely hold the weight. We had 500lb in it and had no problems.  Not recommended for that weight but we wanted to test it out and it held strong.

We used tree straps to hang it up. Took just a few mins if that. Very easy to hang with straps. Packs down nice and small and weighs next to nothing.  Waiting for it to become available because we want to buy another for a friend.  I'd definitely recommend to anyone looking for a hammock.

B011HCCQY2,5.0,"I wasn't exactly sure what to make of this hammock when I first received it. It comes packed in a ziplock bag inside a cello bag. Then part of the hammock is it's own bag. I have shirts that are thicker material than this but I suppose that is part of the key to light weight. It does come with a couple of ropes but I had an opportunity to pick up a pair of reflective hammock straps to really do it up right. When you get it strung up it looks kind of like a long envelope you climb into. They were very generous with the length in particular. Unless you are an NBA player you will encounter no issues finding room for a pillow and your feet.

It will hold two people but I would only say make sure it's someone you love as it tends to put you both together really in a close way. I put this on the scale and it weighed in at 1 lb. 10 oz. That's light enough to stuff in a backpack and if you're in a pinch and just want to stretch out a few minutes it makes a handy pillow sacked up. I have always liked hammocks for camping and now I have one that is small, portable and has great utility.

It is so well designed that I could not have designed this better myself.  I've been on a smoothie cleanse and this is a life saver.  Prior to this I've been on a mason jar user.  I was so frustrated by the lack of sleeves for mason jars.  I couldn't find sleeves for mason jars anywhere except etsy and it was over $30 for one sleeve.
Pros:
1. The top has a magnetic or some sort of suction closure.  It literally will preserve carbonated drinks.
2. Sleeve.  I drink things that are too cold or too hot and the sleeve is a lifesaver.
3.  The top also has those wonderful wrist wraps. I admit that I have small hands and it fits me perfectly but it is on the smaller side.
4. Brush cleaner.  If you do smoothies, you will quickly learn how difficult it is to clean the residue off the interior.  This bottle brush is a lifesaver
Cons:
1. Very hard to clean even with their bottle brush.  I highly recommend the oxo brush for narrow bottles.  It is another $10 on amazon but worth the investment.

B011U1QACE,4.0,"I waited a while before deciding to review here, to make sure the Teikis glass water bottles are as wonderful as they first appeared to be. They are. I think the size is perfect, leaving a small footprint when you store them in the refrigerator, or wherever you place them, yet they still have sufficient capacity at 18 oz. I bought them to put our purified water in (we use a Berkey water purifier) and there is no after taste, the water tastes pure. So refreshing not tasting plastic and finally kicking the plastic water bottle habit.

I know the instructions say to wash them in the top rack of the dishwasher, but I have been washing them in the bottom rack with no problems. I'm such a rule breaker, hehe. Actually, they didn't fit on the top rack so I had no choice. I put the lids in the silverware holder of the dishwasher face down, they come out clean, and washing this way has yet to bother the lanyards attached to the lids. Feeling brave, I even washed the nylon sleeves in the washing machine on gentle, placing them inside a mesh garment bag for fine washables and dried them on the gentle cycle, with no problems. I know they say not to, but for me I had to try, for the convenience of it. Plus, I like living on the wild side. The glass of the bottles seems fine, they aren't perfect at angles, not sure why, but it doesn't affect the integrity of the bottles. The nylon brush that comes with the set is perfect for hand washing, I tried it out when I had juice in a bottle, and found cleaning that way was easy too. I need the bottles to be sterilized which is why I wash them in the dishwasher. I had one washer fall out of a cap to one of the bottles when I took it out of the box the first time. I pushed it back inside and it has yet to fall out again.

The attached lanyard on the lids I find useful. Sometimes I do not feel like using the nylon sleeves, and while I do not trust the lid lanyards completely (because I am not following the recommended care for them) I do hold onto them while holding the bottle as a backup in case the bottle slips from my clumsy hands.

I wish there was a way to prove the bottles are lead free, etc. I am taking them at their word. If they were made in the USA we would know for sure. The way the bottles were shipped was most impressive. They are packed in a form fitted Styrofoam box. Each wrapped individually. Seriously the safest way to ship these bottles. The company is great about emails and wants us to be satisfied. I think from all appearances they seem to be a good company. I recommend these bottles.

Note: I ended up purchasing a second set of the bottles without the sleeves on Amazon from a different company at a cheaper price, but I am glad I purchased this set for the included nylon sleeves and brush. I just wanted extra bottles.

I will update later about how well they hold up over time.

5/19/2017 Update:
While the bottles and sleeves are holding up well, like other reviewers have mentioned, the lids come apart after some time. This is a minor imperfection, the metal parts of the lids are for looks, really, and that is the part that separates. We really do not need the metal outer part of the lid. The plastic lid still works great.",Impressive high quality set. Updated review.,True,
B011U1QACE,5.0,"These bottles are great. I've purchased two sets so now have over 14 or so (two broke as we knocked them down by accident). Granted the glass is about as thick as the peach mason jars you buy from costco. I also puchased another set of milks glasses which were much thicker but were not as tall and didn't have a screw on cap (it had a pull on white cap).

The best things about this bottle is the screw on cap with string so you if your hands are full you can hold other stuff. When we wash it, we hang the caps above the knobs over the kitchen sink. It comes with a case and bottle brush which makes this a great deal.

My husband was diagnosed with colon cancer so we are juicing carrot juices every day. Each bottle holds about 2 cups of juice and he consumes about 3-4 bottles a day. These bottles really helped us maintain our juicing routine.

Tip: if you want to use this in the freeze, fill the bottle about 3/4 of the way up, put the bottle in a plastic bag with the top exposed - no cap, then leave it overnight. A day or two later you can put the cap back on (or not). Then your bottle won't explode (but if it does, then at least it is contained in the bag. We haven't had a bottle break this way.",Great bottle for cancer juicing routine,True,5.0

Next, the glass is really thick and sturdy. I was worried about breakage, however on first sight knew that wouldn't be a problem during normal use. The tops create an excellent seal.

B0146GGGBK,5.0,I ordered this bag in yellow and I am so pleased.  It is bright and cheerful and I would make every bag I own that color if I could.  The bag is large enough for a towel and my thin yoga mat.  I tried it with my thicker foam mat and it worked but it did not slide into the bag as easily I would want so I just use my thin mat.  It is the perfect bag and best of all it is machine washable.  I did receive this bag at a discount from the seller in return for honest and unbiased feedback of the product.,I love this bag,False,
B0146GGGBK,5.0,"This yoga bag is everything that I expected and hoped that it would be. It fits my extra thick yoga mat easily without me having to shove the mat in like I did with my last bag! It has all of the features that I wanted plus some that I didn't even think of like the handy inside pouch to put your cell phone and keys in. I am very glad that decided to finally get a new bag for my yoga mat because this is a huge improvement over my last bag in every way.

I really like how large the bag is because my yoga mat is super thick and having a large bag like this one makes it extremely easy to remove the mat and put it back in. The material is much thicker that I expected, and the quality and stitching are absolutely top quality. The drawstring top ensures that my mat doesn't fall out and the sleek coating of the string/rope used makes closing and opening the bag very easy. The strap is thick and feels strong and it is extremely easy to adjust the length to make carrying it more comfortable. The inner pocket I mentioned is perfect for holding my cell phone and keys (I think all yoga bags should have an inner pocket like this!). I also really like that the bag is cotton and therefore washable. I have a habit of accidently setting things down right in the middle of mud puddles and discarded gum so being able to wash this yoga bag is really great for me! I LOVE the purple color because it makes my bag stand out, I don't have to stand there with everyone else in my yoga group trying to figure out which black yoga bag is mine!

I am very satisfied with my purchase and I would recommend this yoga mat bag to anyone looking for a quality bag to carry their yoga mat in!

B0146GGGBK,5.0,"I really like this mat bag. Ive got a bunch of yoga mats - more than I need actually - and they don't all have carrying straps, so I was really happy to get this bag not only for transport, but as a way to store one of my many mats. I got the burgundy and I love the color. It goes well with my burgundy yoga blanket, and while thats not particularly necessary I do like it when all my things are matchy-matchy. The bag seems like good quality. It is a sturdy lightweight canvas so the bag doesnt have extra weight from really thick canvas. It seems sewn securely and I like the piping around the seams on the bottom of the bag. The strap is adjustable and I can get it just long enough to wear as a crossbody. I will probably sling it over my shoulder more often though. The bag is very comfortable to carry either way though because its a nice wide strap made of the same canvas. The bag is pretty roomy and its big enough to fit my bigger mats. It is a little tricky to get some mats in since it is a top loading bag so you have to push the mat all the way into the bag through the comparatively small top opening, but its not bad (make sure the strap isn't on the smallest setting or it gets kind of hung up). The drawstring closes the bag pretty well. There isn't much space for props in the bag, although you could easily throw a strap in there, and maybe a blanket if its wrapped up inside your mat. There is a zipper pocket inside the bag for small items you want to keep secure like keys or a gym card. Overall Im perfectly happy with this bag. Its going to be great for toting my mat to class, and it will be a place to keep some of my spare mats when Im at home - I may even be able to roll up two thin mats together and fit them in there. Its a great bag!

I purchased the Blue Dove Yoga bag in the olive green and I am so happy I did. I love the color it is a very earthy green.  The bag itself is very basic and it fit my yoga mat perfectly,  I can even squeeze in my yoga towel.  The strap is sturdy and adjustable and makes it easy to carry.  The Mat Bag itself is well made and very light weight.  It is simple and I like that.  The draw string is secure and works perfectly.  There is really no negatives about this bag.

B0146GGGBK,5.0,"I love this yoga bag! It fits my new yoga mat perfectly. It's not a very thick mat and there's room to spare so I'd have no doubt that the bag will fit a yoga mat of any size. I picked the lilac colored bag and it's every bit as bright and vibrant as pictured. It closes via a drawstring and has an adjustable strap to help carry your yoga mat.

B0146GGGBK,5.0,"After lugging around my yoga mat with a velcro strap, I decided to upgrade to something that allows me to also carry some cash and my keys with me to the yoga studio. After I ordered and received this yoga mat bag, I was immediately impressed with the quality of craftsmanship. The cotton cloth is thick and durable, perhaps even made of cotton canvas, which means that this bag is likely to hold up over time. This is important to me because I keep my stuff forever and don't like replacing things. The adjustable strap (also sturdy and well-constructed) makes it easy to customize the fit for my body, by moving the sliding plastic buckle. The drawstring closure has a small clip on it (not sure the correct term for this part) that keeps the drawstring secured tightly. There is an external ribbing added to the seam on the bottom of the bag to ensure added strength and durability. Inside the bag, near the drawstring top, there is a zippered pouch (perhaps 5x5 inches in dimension) sewn into the hem. Here I store my keys and some cash, or a small wallet, which makes it easy to travel light to my yoga class. I also like the range of color choices. Initially, I leaned towards black, to stay basic, but decided to indulge a pop of color by choosing olive green. The green is a great color, full of life, and I am glad I went for it. The bag is comfortable to carry, and stylish.

I haven't washed it yet, but I will probably wash in cool water and to hang dry to avoid shrinking the cotton fabric. (Perhaps if someone else has successful experience washing this item in warm or hot water, you can post a follow-up comment to this review.)

I can't believe it took my so long to invest in this staple item for yoga. I am very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend this brand without hesitation to those looking for a yoga mat bag.

B0146GGGBK,4.0,"I got this in Burgundy and was very excited for it to arrive after my last yoga bag broke a few weeks ago. Some things about this bag are great and some are just ok
my only criticisms are that:
the ""burgundy color is a little dull - the pictures i posted make it look a little more vibrant than it is, but that's ok its a nice muted color i was just hoping for one that is richer.
it is a little too small for my yoga mat - my mat fits in there nicely but mine is a bit longer than regular mats i guess even though its basic thickness - i have to roll mine tight, not in a lazy way before placing it in the bag and it also if unrolls while in the bag takes a tiny bit of effort to than get out of the bag - for all regular yoga mats this should not be a problem at all - for those with the very thick yoga mats - this is NOT  the bag for you. as for length - it fits perfectly - my pictures have the mat exposed just to see the circumference of my yoga mat - it is the perfect length for my yoga mat
the plastics thing that keeps the cord closed is really  really flimsy - it barely holds and i doubt it will last more than a few uses - but this is not a big deal really as it is very easy to just tie a bow.

the good:
this bag is SO well made for light simple canvas - it is very light but sturdy, the stitching is strong and even, the material a good level of thickness, it is sleek and not bulky and the strap part is adjustable and perfectly placed - this is the most comfortable yoga bag I ever used! also like others have noted the internal pocket with the zipper is really useful and a great size.

I really like this bag and would recommend it to someone who wants a simple lean bag that is also sturdy - also the material and color of mine give it a sorta earthy/hippie feel and not a sporty feel so i'd recommend it for someone who appreciates that aesthetic as well.

B014EBPHKS,3.0,"In general this is a nice backpack with hydration pack. The way the pack is supported by the waist straps makes the backpack feel almost weightless while wearing. It has plenty of space for items I carry.

As others have noted, the side/waist pockets can't be zipped closed easily while wearing, but this isn't a big deal. There are two loops where your hiking poles can be stored, but in practice, it's very difficult to get poles that have the discs around the tips, as well as larger pole handles into their respective loops, making me not use that feature since it's too difficult to get the poles in and out without struggle and time.

The clip at the top of the hydration back is held in place by a strap. After two uses, with full bag of water, the clip snapped off. I superglued it back, but it broke again the next time I used it. I was simply hiking; I didn't drop the pack or abuse it in anyway, and the bag was not overfilled. I found a way to use a Velcro strap I purchased to hold the water bag in place (there are two holes on either side of the plastic closure that I can run the Velcro strap through), but this incident indicates that the plastic used is not strong enough to handle a full water bag.  The pack also makes an annoying squeak as I walk. The squeak appears to be occurring at the top left shoulder area (when wearing) where the internal frame rubs against the fabric. I can't access the area without cutting something, so I'm going to have to live with it.

I have to say, although overall this is a nice backpack, I personally believe it's overpriced for what it is and the issues I've indicated.","Good, but has some issues.",True,

The one thing that bugs me is the thumb stud.  Not sure why it's there.  The knife can't be opened using the thumb stud, only by the flipper.  That torsion bar keeps it closed so tight that the thumb stud is useless.  But I bought it for the flipper and so it's not a big enough deal to take away a star in this rating.  I'm just sayin', they could leave off the thumb stud and the knife wouldn't suffer.

B0159A64TQ,5.0,"After hearing endless praise for this type of product from friends and also on television I finally broke down and decided it was time to see for myself. When the Ezy Fitness Waist Trimmer Ab belt arrived I was impressed right away by how lightweight and comfortable it actually was. I have to admit, I was having flashbacks of the awful nylon banded belts that my dad wore when he would lift weights, leaving marks on his belly and the belt smelling awful, filled with sweat but this is nothing at all like I was worried about. I don't belong to a gym so I really needed to take my home workouts up a notch and this trimmer definitely seems to be helping. Each day that I workout I wrap it around my waist, fairly tight to strengthen my core and support my back, and hold it in place with the velcro strap. It has really helped with my posture and does make me sweat a lot more, which is a good thing when working out. After seeing and feeling the support and difference in my posture since I started using the belt I'm going to get another one, that I don't get all sweaty to wear throughout the day. I've been using the trimmer for over a week now and can see a difference in my stomach, not a huge difference just yet but noticeable to me. If I keep seeing results I'm hoping I can convince hubby to try using one too, not sure how well it will work on a beer belly but at least it will provide him back support. Keep in mind, to see the best results you have to be willing to do the work. This is definitely a great product and it even comes with a 30 day money back guarantee so it's a win - win. This Waist Trimmer was supplied to me at no cost in order to evaluate and share my experience. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest & unbiased opinion. One may or may not have the same results as myself when using this product.",Determined to whittle that muffin top away,False,5.0

B0159A64TQ,5.0,"I have been trying to lose weight and inches off of my waistline for a while now.  It seems the more I try to lose, the more I gain.  I am not into the fancy weight loss pills or any other gimmicks because let's be honest, nobody really knows what is in them and what it is doing to our insides.  I saw the EZ Fitness Waist Trimmer Ab Belt for Men & Women and wanted to give it a try.

The belt is real easy to use and fits around most waists upwards to 46 inches. It is made of Flexible Neoprene, which helps to trap heat in your waist area, so you literally heat off the inches like a sauna.  The belt is also 9 inches wide, so it covers most of, if not all of your abdominal area.  The Velcro fastens the belt around your waist and holds it securely.  Both men and women can use the belt and it comes with a 30 day money back guarantee, no questions asked!!!

I did not notice a bad chemical smell with this waist trimmer either, in previous product I couldn't stand the smell of it and would not use it, but the Ezy Fitness Waist Trimmer Ab Belt did not have this problem which I am very grateful for. I did receive this product at a free or discounted price to give my own unbiased opinion all comments and thoughts are 100% my own personal opinion. The only down side to the product that I didn't like was that the size to adjust was limited.

B0159A64TQ,5.0,"I got this for myself as I was considering getting one of these waist trimming belts for a while now. I was still undecided if this neoprene piece with velcro would really do any magic to my guts. Well, this thing arrived and off to try it out.
Pros:
- Very STRONG. It kind of reminds me of one of these postpartum belts that my wife used. Except this one is made for all (or most) sizes and velcro is MUCH stronger.
- It WILL make you sweat. Granted, if you actually work out while wearing it. So it looks and feels like  it is actually working.
- appears to be of a hight quality, so I am in hopes to make use of this trimmer belt for a long time.

Cons:
- It will not make you skinny overnight. Unfortunatelly. But lets be realistic: if you are dedicated to the workout routine and committed to wearing this, I am strongly convinced that results come very soon.
- It makes you sweat a LOT. Well, at least me. It does not ""breath"" well, but I am guessing that it is the actual point of this product.

My observation so far: I decided to give it full 5 stars, because after couple of days of using this thing, I am starting to feel ""skinnier"". At least around my waist. Again, this has been combined with drinking more water (no sugary drinks) and not eating junk foods (as much).

You cannot adjust the seat post for anything beyond 26 inch legs. I am not a tall person (5'11"" with 30 inch inseam), but the maximum seat-post adjustment is about four inches too short for my legs.

B016QCL4QO,5.0,"So, with my experience with the new fad with fruit infused water bottles, they really topped the charts with this one! This Zuper Large Fruit Infused water bottle is definately a top on my list of  Fruit Infuser Water Bottles, hands down! It's a little larger than most other bottles in terms of not only it's size but also it's  holdings of water and the fruit tray, it's a full 24 ozs.

How cool is it that there is a juicer in this Zuper
Large Fruit Infused water bottle! Great for on the go as you can freshly make fresh squeezed items where ever you are!

Of course a definate plus is that it is 100% BPA Free! And another added bonus...they send you a infusion recipe e-book with really great options!

My daughter is a wateraholic! It's all she drinks, she has a water bottle in her hands at all times! Which means I have a hole in my pocket at all times! But water is good for you and I'm proud of her for making such great choices at a young age. What this fruit infused bottle has allowed me to save, by not have to buy cases upon cases of water throughout a week. What this bottle has helped with is we will go and refill a water gallon at the machines, and now that she has the infused water bottle. So I save so much money!

We have also used this for my husband to take his soup for ouch to work in! Its really great that it can,be used for both cold and hot items!

I also don't have to worry about the smaller kids getting a hold to her bottle and making a mess as it is Leak Proof! This particular bottle has been dropped on the floor and knocked of the counter so many times, it's better than a cat with nine lives! It is made up of a really strong tritan Plastic.

It has a Non Slip Grip! And has a flip top lid that doesn't leak!

I received this Zuper Large Fruit Infused water bottle at discounted rate for reviewing/testing purposes, however, all statements, experiences, and pictures are of my own and of my own personal unbiased opinion!",Favorite yet! Hands Down!,False,
B016QCL4QO,5.0,"Fruit infused water is the Best! If this is your first incident bottle purchase and you're still on the fence let me just tell you-- you will not regret it! I'm notorious for buying things, using them once and leaning them in a cabinet to take up space but my infuser bottles? I use them daily and have since I first tried one back in June. I have 2 others that I like pretty well but this one has quite a few features that I really wanted and my others didn't have.

 I like the larger 24oz size. I use and refill this bottle during my work shifts and if I'm doing a 12 hour day I can go through quite a few fill ups and so the least trips to fill it back up, the better. Since this infuser portion is bigger it holds more fruit giving my water more flavor and because the infuser is located at the Bottom of the bottle it continues to flavor the water even when there isn't much left. Most other infusers I've seen and used have a tube insert that runs through the center but never reaches the last 3-4 inches and the flavor can be pretty weak. This ingenious design completely fixes that issue.

Another great feature of this bottle is the drinking spout. My other large bottle doesn't have a drinking spout and so I have to either drink v-e-r-y carefully so I don't get a face full of mushy, watersoaked fruit or carefully pour it into a cup. It sucks and I knew I wanted something that was more practical like this. The spout is wide enough to allow plenty of water through at once. There is also a locking lid. You have to push a button to open it and it has added protection with a little black hook to secure the lid in place. It doesn't leak at all and I can toss it in my gym bag or the backseat of my car and not have to worry about a mess. The hook is also really cool to attatch the bottle to my bag or backpack but it's easy to take off if it gets in your way.

I've never thought to use these infuser bottles for warm drinks but I love the idea and can't wait to try it for my teas! Adding lemon or other fruits couldn't be easier than with this bottle, I'm just not sure how well insulated it is. I'll definitely be trying it though!

The green color is bright and I think very pretty. The plastic looks frosted and has the Zuper logo printed on the front in white. It's a really nice looking bottle and I get compliments on it all the time. It is dishwasher safe but I really like the logo and am afraid that over time it might come off if I wash it in there so I normally just wash it by hand after each use. I'm very pleased with this infuser bottle glad to have found one with all of the features I was looking for. Its definitely an upgrade from the one I was using before. Awesome 5 stars!

I did receive my fruit infuser bottle free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes. I was not paid for my review and was asked only to provide whatever feedback I may have regarding the product, whether it be positive or negative.

B019X2NI18,3.0,"I went with this trainer over the vast list of others for the simple fact that it comes with everything. Set up was simple. For this to work with any kind of resistance for me I had to shift into the high gear ring in front and back. After doing that was the resistance knob was useful. After my first 15 min work out I noticed my new Gator skins where developing a flat spot in the middle of the tire(see pic). I was upset by this considering that there was no warning of tire ruining in the instructions and Gator's aren't a cheap tire. After switching to a old tire and my stock rear rim this problem was less of a worry. I did however include a picture of the flat spot on the tire I use full time for the trainer now. I ride on number 2 switching to 3 for hill simulation and number 1 for cooldown. Like I said at the top of the review, this comes with the skewer, and front tire stand which was why I bought. I didn't want to have to buy these things separate. After the second use or so I did notice that the skewer was bent. But it doesn't seem to be to big of a deal. I've never owned one of these before so I don't know if  they all  move a little when you pedal. But this one does. To the point that I worry a bit about frame damage. Over all it's ok. I've used this for over a week and there are things I like and don't like. Would I buy it again? I don't think so knowing what I now know. But I am still using it. Watching my frame paint for the first sign of damage in the rear area. Maybe I'm just paranoid.

B019X2NI18,1.0,"I hope I am missing something but I think this is going back, sigh. My mountain does not have a rear wheel quick release and to mound the bike to their frame they want you to remove your existing quick release and replace it with theirs, which leaves me stuck. So I thought, ok, I'll just put the little cups over the nuts on the back, no luck, the left nut was fine it fits into the cup, but the right side nut is too big to fit over the nut?

I can't believe there was nothing about this issue so sort of hoping I am missing something, the instructions are horrible but thankfully it is not hard to figure out. Be careful to see that the tensioning thumb screw is screwed in the right way through the tensioning block that you screw to the frame, when I ""dry"" fitted it with no screws I saw that they had the screw in backwards which would lead you to putting on upside down, easy fix, just unscrew it from the block and put it in the other side.

Other than that it really looks great and I jury rigged it to hold my bike so I could try it, don't ask, but it seemed safe for a short test without putting any marks on the frame so I can return it. The test ride was pretty good, for me the resistance is perfect for gears 9-16 so I only need one shifter unless I really want a workout, in 24 it is like riding up Lombard in SF.

B019X2NI18,4.0,"Package came quickly and on time.

Fairly easy setup, though instructions included were not very helpful.

It does what you would hope, provide you some resistance so you can bike indoors.  Not very loud in my opinion.

My main beef is the lack of range.  It comes with 6 settings for resistance.  Switching from 1(lowest) to 6(highest) is really in my perception the difference between a flat and slight incline(maybe 3%) incline if you would out in the real world.

I wanted to simulate a 10% climb.  Even when I tightened everything as much as I could, I still needed to be in my big ring in front to get the resistance I wanted.  Don't get me wrong, it's good.  But not meant for simulating steep inclines.

For the price though, it's a good buy.  If you are a novice rider or someone just trying to stay fit, I would get this.  If you are pro, then you already know you need to spend more to get what you need.",Good but lack of range in resistance.,True,34

B01D2I1RBW,5.0,"I'm new to kayaking and I was looking for a bag that would let me bring my iPhone on my kayak trips safely and without fear of getting it wet. I've tried the little phone pouches before, but they would fog and let some humidity in, so I decided to give this one a try although it's a little bigger than I wanted. That actually ended up being an advantage, because now I can fit my phone, cards, keys, an even a little pad and pen that I like to carry around. The pouch is made of a plastic material and it has a clear side so I can always see my phone and 3 kind of ""ziplock"" closures and if that is not enough, you fold over those closures and then close it one more time with a Velcro line.

I made two videos of this product to demonstrate all the wonderful things, but apparently I'm only allowed to upload one video per review.  So I took the videos and combined them using an app, so if it seems a little nonfluent, that is one reason why. The other reasons is that I am not a great demonstrator/speaker person.  So just bear with me. :)

The first part of the video shows how easy it is to use your phone once in the pouch.  The clear screen does not impede upon the usage of the different apps and such.  One can check their favorite social media site or read text messages when their electronic device is inside of the pouch.

As you will notice in the video as well, the solid black backing of the waterproof bag helps to conceal any valuable items you may have stored within, so in the event that you do not want your debit cards or cash show, you can either store it in your vehicle or shopping car, face down, black back on top, or you can sling it over your shoulder, making sure the clear pouch is facing your body.

The last part of the video demonstrates the success of waterproofness this bag has.  I put a Kleenex and a marker in the bag, submerged the pouch in the water, and then opened the bag, showing that the Kleenex survived without a single drop of water.  I think this would be a great item to take with you to the beach or in the rain or maybe to an amusement park when on water rides.

I really like this waterproof bag/pouch. It is big enough for larger devices such as a Kindle or iPad Mini, and it is small enough for cellphones along with other personal belongs (keys, cash, cards).  I like that the strap is adjustable, and I really like the extra secure zipper and velcro pouch closure. Disclaimer: I received this item for a discounted price with the expectation that I would write an honest review of my experience with it. I will update my review if my opinion changes.

We spend a ton of time on the water and have seen many, many phone, wallet, lighter and key casualties amongst our friends.  Our group usually ties our boats together all weekend and anchor out.  Phones go from boat to boat to boat and sometimes we don't put them in the smartest places.  We also frequenlty anchor out and then walk through the water or dinghy over to waterside restaurants.  Wallets and phones either go in a ziplock or are carried overhead.  If that sounds like your group...this is a must have item.

We have already used the bag for 2 weekends and it is worth every penny.  I bought at a promo price to review, but the current retail price is beyind fair.  We had 2 iphones and 3 wallets in here and the items stayed bone dry during a a few back and forth traipses through the river.  The strap is adjustable, the triple ziplock style seal is durable ( a bit tough the first few times, but it softens and gets easier to close), It is slimline and fairly nondescript.  The only thing I don't like is the additional velcro closure on the outside.  Not the greatest choice for water, but not enough issue to lose a star.  We have left the bag flat when stuffed eith items, rather than folding it down with velcro, so we can fit more inside.  We added a small floating keychain to the strap, for just in case.  It is truly waterproof and we think it is a necessary and helpful item for keeping our items safe and dry on the wild river.

This is a great waterproof bag for your phone. Check out my video to see how it actually works! With 3 seals and Velcro, you don't have to worry about anything in here getting wet. Since it takes a minute to seal everything, this bag isn't great for quick removal, but rather for safety and security while kayaking or boating. Put your things in and leave them or use them through the clear sleeve. Great product and well made. Also would be great for walking in the rain or taking your dog out to the lake or anything involving potential spills or mudding competitions. This bag honestly has many uses! It would even work for a small tablet for bath time with children!

I like the fillet type knife the best, as you can take advantage of its length and narrow point to make some precise cuts...especially in smaller, more delicate game animals. Has a handy carrying case as well.

First off these knives are very sharp straight out of the box, which is expected, but not always achieved.
The case is sturdy and the clasp keeps it closed, so you could easily throw it in your backpack and not worry about the knives spilling out. It comes with 3 knives (wild cape, wild skin with gut hook, and wild bone). The knives are securely held in place and will not rattle around during transport. The bright orange handles feel comfortable and the elk horn design provides some grip so you won't slip. It also comes with a sharpener and a bag of cheap disposable gloves.

B01DU83QXG,4.0,"UPDATED REVIEW: So I bought these socks and they fell apart (as stated below in my original review). The company (ViMall) did contact me via email and informed me that these are not made to be worn in the pool, as the pool floor is too rough.  Since I bought them specifically to wear in the pool, they were gracious enough to give me a full refund. So I would say that if you are NOT going to wear them in the pool, they are great socks.  They are comfortable, and they look very nice.

I thought they were great when I wore them the first time in the pool (1 hour swim class). They are very comfortable, and they look nice.

After only the second time wearing them, I noticed small holes at the bottom. I thought, they're small holes, i can still use them.

Today, the third time I wore them (now a total of 3 hours of wear), they have totally fallen apart, with huge holes, including one at the edge where my big toe completely came through.  I wear a women's size 9, and bought them in XL so it's not the size, it's the quality.  I don't think 3 hours of wear are worth $8.  DO NOT BUY THESE!!!!",DON'T WEAR THESE IN THE POOL,True,

I mentioned how I bought them for whitewater rafting and they told me they aren't ment for that.  People buy them for secuba diving like advertised.  Since I messed up I did not ask for a refund.

I ordered a large since I wear a size 9 in womens shoes, probably should have gotten an extra large since these seem to be a bit tight at the toes. I have narrow feet as well.

And to send it the furthest it can go, you'll need quite a strong person (adult) to pull it back and let it go.  Don't think you can have a kid hold the other ends either.  You MUST secure at least one side to a post or tree, otherwise you'll be lucky to have it travel 40 yards.  Best case is to try and build a wooden transportable launch station that you can mount to the ground or in the dirt, and do all the launching with one person.

B0009VT7D6,5.0,"You probably do not really want to try to take apart your carbine bolt without this tool.  After reading the procedure - I always do this before I try it not during - you realize the only way the bolt comes out is to push down the plunger, because this part and its spring hold in the extractor.  It might sound easy, it isn't, even with three hands and a helper it is going to be problematic.  Besides which there's a good chance said plunger is going to launch itself across the room, that is if you even get it out.  All this tool does is force its rotating arm (the part with the screw in the middle, to the right of the tool) between extractor and plunger, which lets the extractor be pushed out, then allows you to release the pressure slowly.  Then it lets you reassemble the bolt (fortunately quite a bit easier).  By the way, the reason the little arm on the tool rotates, is because the flat side is for disassembly - rotate it and the other side is forked, for reassembly.  Once you do it you will get better at it, and I wouldn't want to try it without this tool!  If you just want to take your bolt down for cleaning, and you are concerned you might not be able to do it, know it may not even be necessary to take the bolt apart just for that.  Examine your bolt closely for rust and gummed old oil, shake it too - does the firing pin rattle?  If it does you probably don't need to take apart the bolt.  Soak the bolt in a can of acetone for an hour and blow it out with compressed air, that's usually plenty clean enough.  The only reason you'd  have to tear the bolt down, is if you have a broken firing pin, broken extractor, or extractor spring or the bolt has been exposed to water or sand, or you think it might be rusty.  I took apart a 40 year old bolt that had maybe 300 rounds through it in its whole life.  And I found no reason to take it apart for cleaning - I just wanted to refinish the bolt and change the spring or else I would not have done it.",I would not dream of taking apart the bolt without this tool.,False,

B002CENQ94,5.0,What a great design and quality made,Five Stars,True,
B002CENQ94,4.0,"I had been eyeing this knife so months. I watched countless videos, looked at countless pictures, and read countless reviews. Needless to say, my expectations for this knife were very, very high. It's important to mention that, because I was very slightly disappointed in the knife. Not much, but enough to dock it a full star. My first impressions, likes and dislikes are belows.

The grips: They're a canvas micarta carved with what TOPS calls its ""Rocky Mountain"" tread. It feels very nice in the hand. Lightweight and with a good grip. The canvas added is clearly meant to maintain the good grip in wet conditions. There is one aspect about them that I didn't quite understand - there's a very thin divider between the grips and the steel handle. I believe they're added to preserve the life of the grips, but they're a bright red color, which clashes horribly with the earthy colors of the grips and the black powder-coated steel. Perhaps there is a purpose for the bright red color, but I'm not digging it.

The steel: The steel is a lot lighter than I had expected it to be. The blade is a full .25"" thick for 80% of the blade (it tapers down at the end of the saw as it comes to a point), but the thing feels rather light in the hand. Lighter than I expected, and somewhat off-putting in the quality department. I'm sure that the lightness comes from the type of steel to improve durable and to not make the knife so brittle, but I was simply expected it to be a bit heavier. Still, I'm sure the knife could take one hell of a beating.

The blade: The backside of the blade, as you can see, features a wide-toothed saw. The blade is still 1/4"" thick at this point, so I doubt this would do much good for sawing through trees. But the purpose of that saw is to saw and cut through aircraft aluminium, and it makes the knife looks pretty mean, so I'm not complaining. Past the saw and further toward the point, there is a faux edge. This is no good for cutting anything, but it is perfect to use as a wedge for splitting wood. The opposing side of the blade features a nice serrated edge that will do any appropriate job pretty darn well. The remaining portion of the blade is the actual cutting surface, but it was incredibly dull and will need to be sharpened before any viable task can be completed.

The sheath: The sheath is a basic nylon-canvas sheath, but it's a good quality that is molle compatible and can also be worn on a belt. There is a plastic, removable insert to house the blade, but it isn't molded to the knife's shape. The good thing about this is that the blade can be inserted ambidextrously. It also doesn't offer any obstruction as the knife is unsheathed, meaning the blade has one less thing to dull its edge. The downside is there is a little play as it sits in the sheath as there is little to no retention. However, there are two velcro straps to secure the handle, which does a perfect job at keeping the knife secure in the sheath. There is a small pouch on the sheath as well that is large enough to fit a firestarter, matches, a sharpener, or whatever else might be needed (if my Leatherman Rebar fits, which I haven't tried yet, I plan on using the pouch for this). The pouch is securely closed with a basic 2-pin slide-release plastic buckle. There are lanyard hold in both the sheath and the knife handle, and both come with a few feet of 500lb paracord. On the sheath's paracord there is an emergency whistle laced in, which can be housed in the pouch too if desired.

Downsides:
1. On all the reviews I read and all the videos I saw, this knife came with the blade, the sheath, and two sort of bonus pieces of gear - the whistle and a small Lansky blade sharpener. Well, mine didn't come with a blade sharpener. It's really no big deal, as I have plenty of blade sharpeners, but it would have been nice for this expectation to have been met.

2. I would have liked the blade to have come factory sharpened. Sharpening blades is an inevitable aspect of owning knives that are actually used, but I believe they shouldn't require being sharpened if they're brand-new.

3. That bright reddish-pink divider in the handle is a real eye sore.

All in all though, I'm OK with dropping the $135 on this knife. I think it's going to do exactly what I want it to do and will quickly become one of my favorite knives.",Almost a 5.,True,5.0

B002PTMNEU,3.0,"The listing for this product states this:
""Fits Shimano style cassette bodies""

This is not quite accurate. There are Shimiano Freehubs that these spacers will not fit on. Case in point, Shimano FH-7800. The part code for the freewheel body is Y-3B9 90200. You can find the tech docs on Shimano's website. I found it via this link as well: http://si.shimano.com/php/download.php?file=pdf/ev/EV-WH-7800-R-2257.pdf

Look at item number 12 in that PDF. You will see that there is a small step a few millimeters on the body that prevents these spacers from sliding all the way on to the cassette. I am also attaching an image of this hub body and you can see how it really looks.

I do not know if there are any other Shimano freehubs built like this.

If you have this type of freehub body then these spacers will not work because the diameter of each one is not large enough to get over that step.

My only gripe, and minor at that, is the swing to the side mount takes a bit of effort to switch. Given any form of stress, combat, home defence situation, or some other situation where time is critical, this could be a minor hinderance.

B0099WESSK,5.0,"I'd seen this exact box at a local outfitter and it was $10 more. It's not the same quality as my MFC fly box or holds as much as that $80 box, but it's the perfect size to fit in my orvis or simms boat bag. Tried to use several large C&F design fly boxes to hold my bass flies, but it became a pain to have my flies split into 3 boxes and some of my spring smallmouth flies struggle to fit. This one box holds enough flies to cover spring smallmouth and summer selections. It does come with a silkscreened KINGFISHER logo on it, which was a surprise. The plastic is all very tough which I was happy to see. The foam is super strong and deep. You might even struggle to get your flies in and may twist the eyes on your flies to do so. The foam is stronger than what's in my MFC box, which is good because some of my spring smallmouth flies are 1/0-2/0. I have a few streamers tied on sz 4-6 streamer hooks that fit fine. I'd even say a sz 8/10 might be fine. I'm going to get another one and set it up for med to large trout flies (clawdads, streamers, hoppers) and keep the C&F design boxes for nymphs and small dries.

B00A5ICP32,5.0,"I agonized over my decision on purchasing a suspension trainer. Do you buy the TRX and pay the big bucks, or do I buy a knock-off and save $100? I opted to go TRX Pro 3. A big decision factor for me was the rubber handles. I did not want foam handles- foam tears, my cat eats it, my cat gets plugged up, my cat has to have a $2000 surgery (3 times so far now). So no foam in my house. I also read that some of the knock-offs were known for tearing at the stitches or the metal buckles breaking. I decided I didn't feel like risking a problem like that and having the inconvenience of having to do a return, or even an injury. The TRX comes with everything in the picture. The straps, the extension strap (which I guess goes around a tree or telephone pole), and a door hang. They are super easy to adjust, and with purchase you get one year on the TRX website which has some decent tutorials, and also there's a ton of free workout tutorials on YouTube. I think you could get just as good a workout with any suspension trainer, but I do feel I have ease of mind with this one that I would not have had with the other options or even less expensive TRX options.",Very professional suspension trainer,True,3.0

Just a couple of things.
Several people have said this knife comes ""really"" sharp from the factory. I don't know what their definition of sharp is but I own butter knives with a better edge.
I used a 400 grit sharpener to get somewhat of an edge on it then a 600 hundred grit to get a good sharp working edge. It took me a while but I did it.
I had also read that the sheath is made of a material that will dull the blade.
After I sharpened it , I put it in and out of the sheath 15 times.

B00E1L78P4,5.0,"This light has been unbelievable for the past 2-3 years that I've owned it. For about a year and a half I used it to commute 14 miles each way to work every day, and during the winter, I would need it for the duration of the ride both in the morning and in the evening. Usually I would charge it during the day, but occasionally I would forget, and while coming home those nights would make me somewhat nervous, it never died on me.

I bought this over the 750 because I was told that the battery would last a lot longer (the guy either said 7 or 10 hours on the lowest setting when I got it, which I didn't believe), and I have always used it on the lowest setting; which I find to be plenty, even going through a trail in dense forest at night.

The light really got tested for me last year when I was hiking the Presidential Traverse; having started at 4 am, the light got about 1.5-2 hours of light in the morning and was fine. However, I got slowed down during the hike and ended up at a spot that was quite far from the road as it was getting dark. I was forced to turn the light back on, and was nervous that it wouldn't last. It ended up taking me about 3-4 hours in the dark before I made it to the parking lot and showed no sign of losing its charge. I can attest that even a well-used version of this light will hold its charge for at least 4.5 hours, but I wouldn't be surprised if it made it to 7 or even more.

B00EAIYQ12,3.0,"2 years, still smells. I bought a couple of these for the pints I have. They function well for the most part, but I don't use it as often as intended. I definitely don't use it as a travel mug because it will splash and leak. I won't buy again. ( Side note - I have the insulated stainless steel mug with coffee lid, its used everyday, and I love that thing!)

1. Funky rubbery smell - I expected the odor, as some of the other reviews mentioned the rubbery smell. I had hoped it would eventually go away or be masked by the smell of coffee. Nope. 2 years on, several washings, lots of coffee, and the rubbery smell is still there. Its not a pleasant smell if you inhale while sipping.

This lid was intended for my pints so I can either sip coffee on the weekend or have a whiskey and coke.

2. Not leak proof, or even leak resistant - I thought the lid would keep splashing liquid from escaping. Nope. If the cup is jostled, it will leak. Its a good lid for sitting and resting, but if you drive with it in a cup holder, expect liquid to splash out...Not leak, splash...

Its great for a cup that will sit on a counter top or flat surface with no movement. Thats why it has 3 stars.

3. Insulation is ok - I have the insulated pints and hoped it would help with maintaining the temperature a bit better than having the open top. I think it helped, but the insulated pints are great to begin with so the lid may be unnecessary if you drink in a reasonable amount of time. It possibly helps when I take it outside. It at least keeps debris from getting in the cup and insects from stealing my drink.","Still smells, leaks - insulates, but won't buy again.",True,

But they help make packing and especially unpacking, so much easier. They are very lightweight which is a concern because if you are flying, you don't want to add unnecessary weight.

B00ILFNDBY,3.0,"Date:12/23/2015

I just received my NEW KA-BAR MODEL#5604 FULL TANG WHARNCLIFF BLADE KNIFE with nylon sheath!
THE AMAZON PACKAGING WAS EXCELLENT! Care and attention to making sure no damage occurred during shipping.
Additionally; all areas of the Amazon Exterior Shipping box were properly sealed against rain and moisture damage.

Unfortunately; when I opened the KA- BAR WHARMSTALKER Product Box; I found that the knife was not secured.
The hilt of the cardboard sheath showed excess wear and tear. The blade had sliced through the""PROTECTIVE"" Cardboard paper sheath. This may have occurred during shipping!!

My suspicions were raised to question if this was a Display Model due to the mottled condition of the KA-BAR WHARMSTALKER Blade.
Despite the price point; I was disappointed in the lack of pride in the condition inspection and quality assurance taken BEFORE  it was shipped to me; the KA-BAR / AMAZON  customer.

MY REVIEW:Let's begin with the sheath inspection:
ITEM:
THE KA-BAR WHARMSTALKER FIXED BLADE SHEATH
MATERIAL: NYLON SHEATH
COLOR: KHAKI BROWN
NOTE: I already know about the get knife and the 'LOUSY MADE/COOKIE CUTTER SHEATHS OPINIONS"" ON UTUBE and other popular social media group sites. my goal is to see if I can give an objective UNBIAS opinion or do I join the LEGION OF PUBLIC OPINION. I know i had a bad start with Condition of my receiving this order But ---I like to give a benefit of a doubt---beyond the Packaging, shipping,and handling of this KA- BAR WHARMSTALKER.  I also would like to say that I'm a CUSTOMER who has made an actual purchase---I am NOT a SPONSERED gear reviewer.  Here is my review and some possible basic modification s I saw that would make the K-BAR WHARMSTALER a great knife.

SHEATH:TOP FRONT VIEW;
The sheath has a approximately a 1' x 2 1/2 SINGLE STITCHED LOOP across the top end. The stitch is reinforced with two steel Grommets.
SUGGEST:
 This loop should be made vertically wider  to accommodate different size belts and or with a d-ring /dangler.
The two Grommet holes need to be placed  vertically lower about 1 1/2"" and can be riveted through the horizontal top Velcro retention strap to be properly useful. VELCRO KNIFE RETAINING STRAP: Size: 8 1/2 x1 INCH
SUGGEST:
 Replace the  top VELCRO STRIP with TWO  9 x1 INCH  Snap back  retention belt straps; riveted securely through the back of the sheath.

KNIFE SNAP RETENTION STRAP:  Found to be too short; hard to use snaps to secure knife.
 SUGGEST:
SNAP RETENTION STRIP BE MADE 1/2"" LONGER: TO AID design in Knife retention, but also further prevent accidental SLICING the knife retention strip. Although i found it to be Very stiff, riveted, snap retention strap does lay flat to prevent you from accidentally cutting the snap retention strip when you attempt to draw the knife from the sheath.
PLEASE NOTE:I attempted to close the snap strap and found it to be too hard to close and too short!
SUGGEST:  A NEW 9"" X I""  SNAP BACK STRIP. THE SHEATH  NEEDS TO BE PLACED FACED DOWN AND THE SNAP BACK  STRIP NEEDS TO BE RIVETED THROUGH THE BACK OF THE SHEATH; TO PROPERLY SECURE THE KNIFE IN THE SHEATH. OR:
FOLD OVWER
SHEATH INSERT:
PLASTIC OR KYDEX(?)

SMALL FRONT POCKET:
The small pocket has a  1 1/2 x 3 3/4"" VELCRO STRIP CLOSURE. Unique plastic liner added to pocket!
Small pocket for your mini personal items. (First Aid, Fishing kit, or a Stone Knife sharpener).
Suggest;
Adding a snap to the exterior of  this pocket closure.
The Velcro closure is too small width wise.
Pocket is too narrow towards the bottomed near the drain hole.
Add hard plastic insert to pocket.

THE BACK OF THE SHEATH HAS THESE FEATURES::
ONE 21/2"" SNAP BACK RETENTION STRAPS FOR YOUR BELT
ONE SNAP BACK LEG TIE DOWN.
THREE MOLY ATTACHMENTS

BLADE HANDLE,
MISSING LANYARD HOLE FOR KNIFE  RETENTION!
THE KA-BAR The Ka-Bar 5604 Adventure WHARMSTALKER FIXED BLADE has BRIGHT ORANGE ROUNDED stippled HANDLE. The handle feels EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE. SURPRISINGLY THE HANDLE  ALSO FEELS SMOOTH, GRIPPY AND EXTREMELY WELL ROUNDED.  Although Visually;  the KABAR WHARMSTALKER handle has an almost sand paper feel to it; I didn't feel any ""HOTSPOTS"".

This knife HANDLE may rival most custom made knives as far as the fit and finish of the handle alone! The orange handle slabs are held together with what look like: TWO ALLEN HEAD SCREWS!
ALTHOUGH; the handle has an excellent finish; it is interesting to note that it lacks a lanyard hole Although KA- BAR has provided TWO  Paracord lanyards.  Since there is NO LANYARD HOLE IN THE HANDLE; i'm guessing that you may have to rely on the loose Velcro strap and the snap strap TO ASSIST IN somehow SAFELY RETAINING  THE WHARMSTALKER IN THE SHEATH!

THE BLADE:
BLADE LENGTH: 4-3/32INCHES
BLADE STEEL: 440 STAINLESS STEEL
The Ka-Bar 5604 Adventure WHARMSTALKER FIXED BLADE comes FRIDAY factory SHARPEND right out of the box;  AND IF I MAY SAY---VERY ANGRY!! YOU CAN SEE THE ANGER can be seen ON THE UNPOLISHED and MOTTLED sides of the BLAD and on the OBVIOUS  120 MICROt GRIND MARKS ON THE BLADE EDGE.
BLADE CONDITION: The Condition blade I received seem to be a display model. Due to the mottled cloudy finish finger MARKS  left on the blade.i

THE BLADE has two positive topside ""GIMPING' areas; one at the base of the blade and one at the top end of the blade.  Both Gimping areas are not too aggressive or overly rounded. While the rear short gimping ramp acts as a thumb ramp; the top of the blade also sports a curved index finger ramp rest.  Your index finger naturally rests on the front topside gimping platform. Gimping on this index rest ramp would have been helpful when you need to choke up on your blade. Both Gimping Platforms ON THE REAR AND FRONT OF THE BLADE  are comfortable and not too aggressive.

SUGGEST:
 MODIFICATIONS:
Adding extra fine GIMPING on the index finger ramp. If the Extra  Fine gimping were to etched starting at the blade hilt near the choile, THE EXTRA FINE GIMPING WERE TO BE CONTINUED ALL THE WAY TOWARDS THE END OF THE NEEDLE SHARP POINT FOR DOING EXTRA FINE DETAIL WORK.  The eighth of an inch steel stock of the blade,  provides a strong TALON- LIKE NEEDLE POINT  front cutting  tip.

Two Slight Safety Oversights in BLADE design.
!) NO LANYARD HOLE:
Despite all these great features on the  Ka-Bar 5604 Adventure WHARMSTALKER FIXED BLADE and sheath; I was slightly disappointed that the Orange Slabs had only TWO allen keyed screws and NO LANYARD HOLE.  The lanyard hole would help tremendously in assisting to properly secure the knife in the sheath and  help in safely retaining the knife in hand when in use.  I would like to see if KA-BAR  would consider installing a center screw and a  collared lanyard hole in the handle of this knife if I were to send it back to them.

2) NEEDS AN IMPROVED CHOILE DESIGN
I also noticed that when you use the KABAR WARMSTALKER  knife in with the INDEX FINGER IN THE CHOKED UP POSITION; the CHOILE needs to be made more pronounced. The Choile at the base of the blade needs to be made deeper and  curved upwardly into the blade's cutting edge of the bottom cutting edge. This would improve comfort and  safely balance the knife when in use.

WEIGHT AND BLADE BALANCE;
I found the BLADE BALANCE TO  BE BETWEEN the beginning of the handle slab and FORWARD OF THE FIRST ALLEN HEAD SCREW.t

CONCLUSION:
THIS IS MY FIRST KA-BAR PURCHASE!
THE OVERALL QUALITY, OF THIS KA-BAR ADVENTURE WHARMSTALKER
Fixed Blade was a slight disappointment: due to some design and quality control  issues.
HANDLE: This is a knife that has and exceptional handle! The Handle was quite comfortable and seem to almost custom fit my medium sized hands.  My expectations were that i would 'NATURALLY HAVE TO BUY A NEW SHEATH"" . After watching many knife videos over the years; many reviewers would always start with ""CEREMONIOUSLY THROWING AWAY THE SHEATH! I found that the  standard sheath would be temporalily useful. I would eventually have to purchase a new sheath in the near future.
I do take issue with the MISSING LANYARD HOLE IN THE HANDLE.  Although the handle was quite comfortable, i was somewhat dismayed about the missing lanyard hole. The Lanyard hole is a vital safety feature that if not properly use; can cause mishaps and accidents in the field. Although; the KA-BAR WHARMSTALKER blade handle was comfortable to hold; the thought of this hunting knife slipping out go my hands became a primary safety issue.  The Ka-Bar 5604 Adventure WHARMSTALKER FIXED BLADE"" is primarily a Hunting knife---not a kitchen knife. It requires Extra Safety Handling Measures due to its lack of a safety lanyard.
I would like to see an upgrade version of theKa-Bar 5604 Adventure WHARMSTALKER FIXED BLADE with:

1) A lanyard hole in the Handle
2)A deeper GIMPED CHOILE at the base of the blade.to provide safer griping handling. AND OF COURSE A
3) QUALITY CONTROL ISSUES: It was hard to determine what kind of finish this knife had due to the mottled dirty finish.
a) Suggest: Bring the entire Blade to a HIGHER POLISH OR BEAD BLAST FINISH
b) ELIMINATE THE 120 GRIT(?) GRIND MARKS ON THE EDGE OF THE BLADE.

 According to many UTUBE Videos I've seen; the two outstanding opinions seem to prove to be true:
K-BAR  KNIVES AND SHEATH were made to be modified. Unfortunately; these ""MODIFICATIONS"" and quality control issues are at the added expense to the consumers.

Sincerely;

B00ILFNDBY,4.0,"I have a great respect for the Ka-Bar brand of knives, I do like the style of this blade and the fact that I have respect for the ""Adventure series"" of Ka-Bar, I am not so happy with the steel it is made from, or maybe it's the way it's been tempered- I have a difficult time when I tried to put a ""shaving sharp"" edge with my diamond stones, the steel is easily removed, but it is not wanting to get the edge down to the required sharpness- I have had this problem with cheap stainless, improperly tempered 440, as someone who has worked with many exotic metals (welding, forging & casting), 440HC requires a different way of final tempering the edge after the hardening process- if you read how Ka-Bar brand is shaped, after the annealing process, then allowed to be hardened in the ovens & cryogenically tempered, but the spine of the blade and the edge need to be treated differently than a carbon steel, as with the oil hardening process of 0-1 tool steel, 440HC requires that the cutting edge be brought to a higher temperature and cooled down faster than the spine ,but not so that it has internally stresses in the molecular structure of the steel. If you have a chance to read the way that other knife manufacturing facilities process their own 440,420 stainless- whether it's HC,A or B, all have different properties that need to be worked as such- I can say that for design of this knife, is an A+.

B00NFD3D8A,5.0,"Shipped this as a wedding gift for a friend who uses it constantly. I've the smaller 1L version. Have to say that with a flexible solar panel and a 10,000mAH ruggedized LiIon power bank behind it, works very well. I've replaced it with a RAV power bank (Amazon), 20,000mAH. There are two side pockets, deep zippered slits. When one power bank is fully charged, I replace it with either the Eceen or the RAV. So does my friend. The solar panel is held in place by a thin snap on lanyard and is easily removed if you want to place the solar panel in say, some tree branches. The power cable in the back is sufficiently long enough for that. This has a 2L bite lock collapsible hydration pack while mine has the 1L. Both are easily accessible and washable. Behind the hydration pack is a large pouch, large enough for a 10"" iPad or a larger Android tablet. Inside top flap where the solar panel attaches to on the outside, sports a zippered pouch. I stuff mine with cables, adapters, and chocolate snacks. There's two side pouches as well. I keep a smaller solar power bank in one and a collapsible Platypus hydration flask (REI, Amazon) in the other. Overall, well constructed, comes in a variety of colors. Sturdy zippers, doesn't jam.

B00VRIOJ1A,4.0,"For any electronic device, it is valuable to have a way to keep up with, and replace, chargers. The Fit Bit Charge HR is no exception. Not to mention, it is always nice to have more than one option to charge your device without having to carry a charger around with you. For ladies, this is slightly less of an issue as many of you carry purses (although I am sure there is sufficient argument that you have no space left because of all the other necessary things you carry). Any way you look at it. It is convenient to have an extra charger (or 3) to place in handy locations for charging convenience. This off-brand charger for the Charge HR is a good choice and perfectly functional for the designated purpose. It works out of the box and does not require any special instructions or unique requirements. In short, this product is exactly what it is advertised to be and works as expected.

Thumbs up for a quality replacement product.

Amazon requires that I inform you, I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. My opinion is in no way influenced by the price of this product and I would have been equally content paying the $9.99 list price. I did note at the time of this review that this product is currently unavailable. Hope they make more available in the future.",Quality replacement charger,False,
B00VRIOJ1A,5.0,"QIBOX Replacement Charger & Charging Cable for Fitbit Charge HR with UL Certified Wall Adapter arrived quickly and was well packaged (thanks Amazon). The package is sealed and requires tearing or cutting the edge to open. The cable is very similar to the original cable with a few exceptions. The molded ends have no brand name molded in and there are no actual Fitbit markings on the metal USB end as the original. The quality looks similar to the original and very similar in flexibility. The total length of the cable is 11.5 inches from end to end. The Fitbit end has small wing like tabs that hold the connector to the tracker and some have reported these generic ends do not fit well. I found the cable I received fit just fine and I have had no issues with the charging of the tracker. The included charger is a generic cube style AC wall charger and has no polarized AC plug prongs so it can be reversed in the outlet when plugged in. The adapter also has agency approval markings of UL listed and FCC which usually indicates a better, safer product (adapter is plastic). The adapter has no power indicator so you will have to check your Fitbit to see if you have power when it is plugged in to the AC power. It does function as described so it would make a great replacement or extra charging system for the Fitbit charge HR so give it a try and see if you experience the same performance I have.

Long, braid-armored hose, self stows.

Large gauge is easy to read. Mine is accurate to about +/- 2PSI
The gauge is only 5 PSI increments.
Valve has bleed button. ( ABS )
The pump handle feels a little wobbly when fully extended, but thats the way it has to be. There has to be flexibility where it attaches to piston. Fully up there isn't much left to keep it in column. That's by design to get maximum output.
The heavy duty cast feet and gauge base make it reasonably stable and have anti-mar pads.

The chuck is easy to use and trouble free. Just RTFM or read the manual. No assembly/disassembly needed to switch between Presta and Schrader. For Presta, it's especially nice, you simply pull it off the valve, with no unscrewing, Schrader though is old-school screw-on-screw-off

Titanium stoves of almost identical design go for at least $30-40 more and only weigh at most 1 - 1 1/2 ounces less. It's been on a ton of trips with me so far, and has held up amazing.

Update: after using this multiple times, on the trails and also testing it at home many times, for the money you really cannot beat this stove. Many times I have went to go cook something and just went ahead and pulled the stove out instead of using the regular stove in the kitchen. I have not yet got it to fail in over a year. I have folded it up and wound up the cord and put it right back in my backpack, the gas throttle seals in the main seal and the braided line are yet to fail. I originally purchased this because it takes quite a bit to tip it over, I have used multiple stoves that actually fit on the top of the canister.

B01GLKDYL4,5.0,"Because I often review camping/backpacking items with the help of a son, I gave it to me to test.  This is his report:

""I do a lot of backpacking and am always looking for ways to minimize or cut down my pack weight. Like a lot of ultra-light backpackers these days, most if not all of my cooking is boiling water to re-hydrate the different food packs that I have. This means that I do not need to cook meals anymore, all I need is a way to quickly boil water.

""Uning Outdoor Camping Stove Ultralight Compact Foldable 3000W Gas Powered Backpacking Stove with Piezo Ignition for Butane / Butane-propane Mixed Fuel Canisters is a good one. The burner unit is made out of lightweight aluminum alloy and stainless steel. There are four legs that are attached to the side of the burner that fold out to make the base of the burner, one at each of the four quadrants.  Each base leg has support arm that folds back making for a solid base to set a pot or pan on. The unit is low profile keeping the center of gravity close to the ground. There is a small push button piezoelectric ignitor that sparks to ignite the stove after the gas has been turned on. The gas is supplied to the burner via a metal braided hose that is about 11 long. There is a threaded fitting that allows you to screw onto a standard propane fuel canister or a butane bottle. The on/off and flame adjuster are done by an adjustment nob at the end of the 11 gas line, just after the canister fitting.  The whole unit is small and designed to fold down into a compact bundle that fits in its own nylon stuff sack.

""To try it out, I took it with me on a three day backpacking trip to the Adirondack Mountains of Upstate NY.  I have a small 64 oz. mug / pot that have insulated handles on it that I use to heat water in. The stove in its stuff sack fit easily inside the pot making for compact storage in my pack. When I got to the campsite that night I set the stove up on the ground and connected it to my fuel canister. I filled my pot with water, turned the gas on and pushed the ignition button and it flamed right up. I was easily able to adjust the flame to where I wanted it and sat back and waited. I timed it and started to get rapidly rising, small bubbles in about 4.5 minutes and a full boil in 5.5 minutes.  There was a little breeze and I am thinking about packing a small piece of foil that I can use as a wind screen.

 ""I like this and recommend giving it five stars"".

B01GNJNQMU,4.0,"This was a high and low for me. I saw this and thought that my teenage son would love to have this for his new tackle box. I became very excited over the prospect of giving this to him and seeing enthusiastic face at the thought of using it. Of course, I admit that I was more than a little disappointed when it arrived and it turned out to be so small. This item is super small and can fit inside of a regular sized tackle box. That being said, the case is actually kind of cool and easy to open and use, with latches that stay closed when you want them and open upon command. The see through lid makes it easy to know where the items are you want to get to. And although it is small, the fishing lures and hooks and other items are all ones that he would use. So although I was disappointed in the size, it is still a useful product. Another point that needs to be made, the package is not made in America and the package is not in English so it is hard to tell what is in each compartment (if you're not an experienced fisherman).

The description clearly states it's ideal for playing scrabble in the car, plane, train, etc. -- if the tiles were magnetic and the board folded, yes it would be perfect travel edition.  If the tiles actually locked in place, it would be an ideal travel board.

As it is -- the locking tiles allow you to tilt the board at various angles (but not far past 45 lest the tiles start falling out).

Only other minor gripe is the drawstring bag is a little skimpy if you also plan to put the tile holders (red long rectangles) in with the tiles.... it's literally 1/4"" too short to safely secure everything.

I think Scrabble boards should spin like Lazy Susan but that is not always possible unless you get the more expensive boards.  The Tile Lock Scrabble at least spin better with the tiles staying in place when someone else's turn.

The size of the board is much smaller than all of the versions of Scrabble I have played over the years.

What is nice about this is the compact size, and yes, smaller than a regular size board.  There are small beads that keep a tile secure as you place them for playing.  This makes it easy to work with even if your board gets tipped.

This is a nice portable size, great for the car, taking to someone's home, to the office, etc.  And, again, that is because of the size.

The only downside to this is there is no protection for the tiles on the plastic holders.  If you go through the trouble of placing beads to hold the tiles in place, what about the tile racks?  The tile racks could use some security, as for now, there is none.  And, basically, this means that if you are in the car playing with a friend, your board is secure, but your racks are not.

The tile lock feature is very intuitive, but, at the same time, it makes all the difference for those playing the game.  The tile lock feature keeps the roles from sliding on the board.  So if you accidentally bump the board or want to hold it at an angle to visualize it differently, the tiles won't go sliding around.  This feature is worth its weight in gold if you have a youngster in the house who's prone to bumping the board.

The plastic tile racks also help hold the tiles so they don't fall as easily.  The game box advertises that this game design works well for travel, but, honestly, it's also great for having at home.

I didn't talk much about the game during this review, because everyone enjoys playing Scrabble.  It's almost a right of passage to play Scrabble as a child.  And many also enjoy it well into adulthood.  In fact, once one can read well enough to play Scrabble, it almost becomes more enjoyable over the years.

I highly recommend this game as a gift for someone else or even yourself.  You won't regret it!",Why didn't I think of this?,False,
1223063151,3.0,"Tile Lock Scrabble is a portable take on the classic board game.  The board is shrunken to 11x11 inches (compared to the traditional 14x14) and is a solid piece of plastic instead of a folding piece of cardboard.  There are small rubber feet to help keep the board from sliding around.  Because the board is rigid, you can support It on your knee or on an uneven surface.

To help with the portability, this board features tiles that are held in place by small posts all throughout the board.  This is what they refer to as the ""tile lock"".  Once a tile is in place, any lateral movement of the board won't cause it to move out of place.  A major problem with this design, and the reason that I give this product three stars, is that if you bump the board up and down, the tiles still go flying.  They are only held down by gravity.

The board comes with four plastic tile pews.

Overall, I found the small 11x11 size with the small plastic tiles difficult to get used to.  The tiles are smaller than a traditional scrabble board and a bit slippery.  Because of their shrunken size, my adult-sized fingers fumble with them a lot.

1223063151,3.0,"I've played Scrabble since I was a kid using the traditional board and tiles.  I chose this product as a method of introducing the game to my daughters, both of whom are old enough to understand the concept and rules but also young enough to guarantee that the board will be hit at least once each game by accident.

The first thing I noticed is that the board is significantly smaller than a traditional Scrabble board, and the tiles are likewise smaller to fit the board.  This is probably fine for kids who generally have better vision than adults and can more easily handle small tiles, but it makes it tougher for adults.  The feel of the tiles is also just not the same as the wooden tiles to which I've grown is , although that's hardly a fault.

The tile lock idea is great, but the use of ""lock"" is misleading.  These tiles can be knocked around the board without too much difficulty, especially if the board is bumped at all from below.  I think larger tiles to prevent this problem would create other issues by being too snug, so maybe larger locks would have been better.  Whatever the solution, this system is far from perfect.

I really like the idea of this product and I'm sure we'll make use of it.  Even with its faults, it's a better option for kids than the regular game.  If they can work out some of these kinks, this could be a five-star product.","Great idea, middling execution",False,

It was one of the first games we had -- my parents enjoyed playing it with each other even when we were too young to be good players.

As anyone who plays Scrabble knows, it is all too easy to jostle the board and move the pieces.

The good news is that this set is about one-third the price of the set my Mom has but the bad news is that it is smaller and not as nice.  Unlike many Scrabble boards, this one does not fold.  It is approximately 9 1/2 inches square and the background ""regular"" squares are light blue/gray, not the white or cream I am used to.  There is only a thin border around the playing area.  The list of letter tile distribution that was on the side of the board I grew up with is on the rules sheet in this set.

The system for keeping the tiles in place is a grid of little red plastic bumps on the corners of the squares. The tiles are plastic too, not the wood I am used to, and they have tiny recessed corners that fit around the red bumps.  Once in position, the tiles sit very securely on the squares -- I tilted the board to almost vertical before the tiles fell out of place.

There is a major issue with the bag the tiles are in.  The fabric is so thin that you can see the letters on the tiles through it.  This would make cheating to get better tiles very easy.  You will want to either make another bag or put it inside something opaque to keep players from being able to see the letters while choosing tiles.

The box a game comes in is not important for playing a game, but is important for storing the game.  The cardboard is quite thin and the box is not very sturdy.  I worry this box would not last nearly as long as the game itself.

The bottom line is that if you want a Scrabble board where the tiles won't move around while you are playing but also want a more affordable price, this set could be good for you.  If you really enjoy playing Scrabble, I recommend you spend the extra money for the Scrabble Deluxe Edition","Tiles don't move around but set feels ""cheap""",False,

Second, the tiles to not lock per say, they fit very well and unless you hit a pothole the pieces should stay in.

The tiles DO NOT lock in place; they are just restricted from excessive movement.  Obviously, my other board is a little over double this size.  This board only measures 10 inches on all sides so it's closer to a travel or portable size. Besides the plastic board, a cloth bag holds all 100 tiles and four tile racks are included.

There are only two things I do not like about this particular version.  The biggest disappointment is that the rubber feet are not at the edges of the board. This means when the game is being played, the board can be easily tilted if someone leans on any one corner because the feet only support the center of the board. The second thing is that the game is mislabelled because the tiles DO NOT LOCK in place but they stay seated well (or are prevented from excessive movement) as long as the board is not tipped.

1223063151,2.0,"Based on the name ""Tile Lock Scrabble"" I thought the tiles would actually lock in place, perhaps lightly snap on to the board, but these tiles don't lock on at all.  Instead there are little raised dots on the corners of each square on the board.  Each tile has indentations molded into the corners.  You place a tile on the board and it rests between the dots.  The deluxe edition scrabble board has bezels between the squares that serve pretty much the same purpose as the dots do on this one (but it's twice as much as this one.)  The instructions say that the tiles will stay in place even if the board is tilted, which is absolutely true, but they will not stay in place if the board is bumped or jostled even a little.  The slightest bump and the tiles dance right off their squares.

It says on the box that it's perfect for travel, but I can't think of travel situation where the board might get tilted, but not bumped: certainly not a plane, or a car, or a boat, or on the beach, or on the grass.  And the board is bigger than a laptop and doesn't fold, so it's not exactly compact.

I don't think they should bill this as being good for travel and they should definitely lose the ""tile lock"" nonsense.  This is a good basic, inexpensive, scrabble board for kids or for someone who wants a scrabble board but doesn't want a full sized one.  It is better than just the flat board with no guides to hold the letters in place (the Super Scrabble for five dollars less,) but to call this a travel board is a stretch.","Doesn't really ""lock"" the tiles in place",False,

This Tile Lock Scrabble is my 3rd Scrabble Game.  I also own the Scrabble Deluxe Edition and the Game Folio Scrabble.  The one thing that each of these versions have in common is that the tiles are meant to not slide around by way of some alteration to the board. With the Deluxe version the tile spaces are recessed, with the Folio the tiles snap in and with this version the tiles are supposed to lock and while they do click in, lock is not what I'd call it. So if you are looking for one that can take a bit of movement and jostling, keep looking beyond this version.

The pegs do achieve this if you tilt the board a little bit or if you just want to slide it do someone else can view it easier (not read upside down). They do not achieve any kind of helpfulness if the board is knocked against or bumped roughly. The tiles will go spilling.

All parts of this game are plastic - which with kids is kind of nice - I can wash them!  But I do kind of miss those wooden letters - but maybe I'm just old school.

The board itself is smaller than a normal board - it measures 10"" x 10"".  There are 100 letter tiles, 4 plastic tile racks, and tile bag included with game board.

Overall my kids and I enjoy both using this board for education purposes (they spell their spelling words on it) and for an actual fun game of scrabble.  I just wish the tiles actually locked into place. Seems like a simple adjustment to the design could have achieved this.",Tiles don't lock,False,

The tile lock feature works well and we are quite pleased.  Our only complaint is tha the board and pieces are smaller than our traditional board.  While still perfectly readable - to get 5 stars the board and pieces should be bigger.

It seemed like a good value until my kid dropped it (about 3 feet drop) unto a carpeted floor. One of the knobs popped off and because the plastic broke, I could not get it back on. Being able to control only one direction of etching gets old after about 20 seconds. We tried to superglue the part back on, but it still did not work. Off to the landfill. Too bad - if the manufacturer had just invested a few more pennies to make this more durable, it could have been a terrific travel toy.

Sometimes, however, he can't join the ends of his layout as the ends just don't meet up exactly. The Wacky Tracks solve that issue beautifully. They can flex however needed to get the two ends to join. Because of this flexibility, the track path is a bit wobbly, but that's a minor issue.

B00009AWM4,4.0,"My son plays with the water feature all the time. When we received it, one of the lights did not work. Also the finish was not what I expected when compared to other Bruner trucks. Maybe it's time to redesign this.",Great fire engine,True,
B00009AWM4,5.0,"I bought this for my 3 yr old grandson and he loves it. The hose really works well and squirts a long distance, so it is best to test it outside. Very realistic with lots of moving parts and durable construction.",High quality Toy,True,
B00009AWM4,5.0,Hands down! Bruder makes the best quality kids toys out there. The amount of detail and the precision workmanship is amazing. And they're very tough.,My son loves his fire truck!,True,
B00009AWM4,5.0,Very large truck.  It does a lot of things and was a gift also.  This will be a toy that lasts a long time.,Big Truck,True,
B00009AWM4,4.0,"This is a great truck, and like all Bruder products it is very realistic!  My son absolutely loves it, and I can see him playing with it for years to come.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because this is our first Bruder product, and I was surprised by how plastic it was.  I fully understood that it is made of plastic, but I guess I am just used to Fisher Price type toys that are made of really thick plastic, this reminds me of the plastic that a dollar store toy would be made of.  That is just me being nit picky though.  If you want a realistic, larger fire truck that your child will love you can't go wrong with this.",My son loves it!,True,
B00009AWM4,4.0,"My sons have 6 or 7 Bruder trucks and they are great! They are big, well made and hold up to my 3 and 5 year olds' rough play. I just wish that the stabilizer attachments ( I think that's what those ""legs"" are that come off of the sides) were permanently attached, as I am always finding them lying around the house. This shouldn't be a problem with older, more RESPONSIBLE kids :)  Love that the fire hose actually squirts water,too. It certainly isn't the least expensive toy you could get a kid, but it's worth every penny. You absolutely get what you pay for!

I also recommend any of the Bruder garbage trucks, the dump truck and the crane truck!",Bruder trucks are the best,True,
B00009AWM4,5.0,"This brand of truck is wonderful in my opinion. It has a wonderful amount of detail, working, extendable ladder, the engine lifts forward to show off the engine. We haven't tried the water pumping feature, but it seems great. My father has 3 other Bruder products, and this fire truck adds to our garbage truck at home for our 3 year old son. They get a wonderful amount of usage. There have been some issues with pieces breaking, but we moved this year, and the move was not kind.
I wouldn't hesitate to buy another!

UPDATE:
After a month and a half, the truck is still holding up well, especially considering how many parts there are. I will note that the hose nozzle comes off the hose easily, I'm sure there is a good reason for it, but i find that i'm chasing down a small grey nozzle at least once a week. The truck has taken a few tumbles from 2-3 feet and is holding up well, not that i'd suggest such abuse. The kids still love it, and i'm still very happy with my purchase!",Love these trucks!,True,
B00009AWM4,5.0,LOVE these Bruder toys!  They are well made and have lots of interesting articulation in the ladder area.  The tires seem to be made of rubber rather than plastic which just adds to the realism for the kids!  The front cab even tilts forward.,Bruder Fire Engine,True,

B00009AWM4,3.0,"My son has a lot of fire-trucks. I got the Bruder because they are supposed to be the best. OK...they are HUGE and they look nice, but how can a 50 dollar fire trucks have doors and compartments that don't open ? This baffles me.  His 20 dollar toys-r-us fire trucks have doors that open and at least one compartment that opens. This does not. His 20 dollar toys-r-us fire trucks have flashing lights all over the truck, not just two little beacon lights on the top with a very low pitched siren.  Overall I think the aerial ladder/platform assembly is nice and well built. The wheels and tires are of very high quality. But that's where it ends.  If I had to do  it all over again, I would not buy this.","Nice BIG truck, but doors and compartments won't open and siren/flashing lights are not the best",True,5

Would definately recommend though!",great fire truck!,True,
B00009AWM4,2.0,The toy is really not too impressive. My son played with it for maybe a week and put it on the side. Not really something I would spend 50 dollars on and the hose is a joke.,Cheap and uninteresting,True,
B00009AWM4,4.0,Too complicated for a 2 year old...but probably great for a 3 -4 year old due to the mechanical parts. I think the mother of the grandson kind of set it aside until he got older and didn't get frustrated by trying to raise the ladder without cranking it.,a great fire truck,True,
B00009AWM4,5.0,Santa got this one right!  My 5 year old loves it and plays with it every day. It's made with great quality. Although it has small parts that can break off if forced so I don't recommend for a child under 3 or 4.,Christmas hit!,True,

B00009AWM4,5.0,"I bought this fire engine as a Christmas gift for my grandson who will be 3 in March. He absolutely loved it!  He figured out where the water goes and how to pump it out. He also figured out how the ladder goes up and down and the sirens. The best part about this fire engine is how it sparks my grandson's imagination. He loves the electronic stuff but he still comes back to his ""Fire Truck"". He likes it so much I am going to buy him another Bruder truck for his birthday!",So glad I bought this fire engine,True,
B00009AWM4,5.0,"My mother-in-law bought this for my daughter's third birthday. She loves transportation (cars, trains, buses, utility vehicles, etc) and has been asking for a fire truck. This one is insanely awesome! The ladder cranks up fairly tall, the water hose rolls out and is flexible, which is great for kids who play more aggressively with their toys. The truck makes noise, but not so loud that it becomes annoying to the nearby adults.

What surprised me is how big the engine is. It's like a little scale model of the real thing, nearly 10"" tall (though seems even bigger). I think I was just blown away by how much value a child gets with this toy. I've seen some firetrucks at toy stores in the same retail price range but none compare in features, construction quality, and realism to this one.

This truck has quickly become one of my daughter's favorite toys.","It's large, it's realistic, and it's durable.",False,

B00009AWM4,5.0,"This was a must-have Letter-to-Santa item for our five year old son.  He played with this for over 3 hours at a friend's house so he wanted one too.  He has played with it everyday since Christmas.  The best part about this toy is the ability to fill the base with water and shoot the water from a long hose.  This feature makes the toy.  He also enjoys the ladder that goes very high and the lights and sounds (horn, siren, and engine sounds) of the fire engine. The toy is made of plastic but it is not cheaply constructed.  German toys have a high level of quality from my experience.  I would compare the plastic to that of my son's Imaginext toys.  It is quite large in size (about 2 feet long and 9 inches high) and has offered our son hours of fun both inside and outside.  It is a well made toy and gets the imagination going.  I would highly recommend this toy even if the price point is a bit on the high side - this is the most expensive toy we have ever purchased for our son.",Fun by the hours,True,

B00063FE66,5.0,Great product my kids love it.,Love it,True,
B00063FE66,4.0,"One of the only things my daughter wanted for Christmas was a cash register and she required it have a scanner.  This one foot the bill!

The register is a perfect size in that it's buttons are large enough for little fingers to navigate but not huge and cumbersome that it's hard for her to carry around. The buttons function as a calculator which is fun and the register will read off the inputs and total.

The scanner works great with the supplied bar codes as long as you match up the arrows on the scanner and the arrows above the bar code. A wise reviewer suggested that you make copies of the bar code sheets before you use them so that's what we did.

The only downside I see with the product is that the included money don't cover all the denominations of US currency so you can't expect to use it as a learning tool for your child. That's easily remedied by purchasing a secondary product.  However, there are not enough slots in the drawer for every denomination either. A minor issue as its a toy after all!

Overall I am very happy with this toy!",Exactly what we were looking for!,True,
B00063FE66,4.0,"I have 3 and 5 year old daughters and I bought this item bc they play with a different cash register at a friend's house and really enjoy it, so this was a Christmas gift. After looking at a bunch of different cash registers online I settled on this one and was very excited!  First the good - it has all the bells and whistles, it is a great size, they can both use it easily, it does math ...I am sure you have all read what it does...it was perfect in my mind!
The bad- I think my expectations were too high! I purchased the grey and green one and in comparison to many other cash registers this one is lacking bright colors or charcters...my daughters may have been slightly underwhelmed at first, which is slightly disappointing. Also it takes a bit of practice to get the scanner to work, and if it doesn't actually scan it won't beep...so i am sure you can imagine the level of frustration when a 5 year old wants to scan and item but it WON'T  beep. After awhile of play we did get the hang of the scanner, which was then awesome!  We went through our house with the stickers and stuck them on special (approved)  items they could purchase and add into there shopping cart. Also since they received this on christmas we had a few toys that had not been taken out of the package and still had bar codes on them....so my kids then went ""christmas shopping"" and the scanner works on other real bar codes aswell so that was a lot of fun!!
It received 4 stars bc the scanner take some time to be able to scan easily, I would like it to say more phrases/ talk more. I wish it was louder, bc it doesn't do anything except beep and it only does that with a bar code....I wish it beeped each time you pulled the trigger. It only came with ONE credit card!! Ummmmm the chances of loosing this are extremely high.

B00063FE66,3.0,"The Zillionz Talking Cash Register advertises itself as an educational toy that teaches kids to count in three languages (English, Spanish, and French). It includes play cash, coins and a credit card, as well as stickers you can place on objects that can be scanned using the hand-held scanner. It runs on 3 AA batteries, included.

As a toy cash register, this talking register is a good, but not great purchase. The scanner does work, but you have to line up the arrow on the scanner with the arrow on the sticker, and you can't set the price yourself (the stickers already have a price listed). The cash register interface is just a glorified calculator, honestly. It includes multiply, divide, and subtract buttons along with the add button and the face looks like a generic calculator. It does not have a way to include tax, so if you are looking for a ""real world"" cash register that will teach kids about sales tax, this is not the one for you. The mic works, but you really have to speak loudly in it close up to hear amplification in the volume of your voice. The money drawer will hold  ""real"" dollars and change, along with the fake money that is included. There are not a lot of bills or coins, though, so if you want to play store with this register, be prepared to either use some real money or purchase additional fake money up-front. You will run out very fast.

As an educational toy, it is so-so. You can switch the language to Spanish and French to learn how to count in a different language, but the distortion of the words as they pronounce the numbers makes it difficult to hear them clearly. I know Spanish and French and had a hard time hearing the numbers clearly. Even the English voice is a bit too high-pitched and singsongy, making it difficult for a child learning English to pronounce the numbers after hearing them. On a positive note, the voice isn't too loud, but I don't see a way to turn it off or lower the volume if you don't want it. Last, since it is just a glorified calculator, it does not have a good way to learn about sales tax. Thus, the educational aspect of this cash register is minimal.

Having purchased a ""Barbie"" cash register many years ago for my daughter for more $$, I wasn't expecting this one to be super top-notch, but overall I was disappointed. The ""Barbie"" one I bought previously has many of the same features (microphone, but of much better sound quality, credit card, money/change), but also came with gift cards that really subtract off the total automatically, and interchangeable laminated cards representing various stores (grocery, pet, beauty, clothing, etc.) so you can one-touch an item to add it, as well as a keypad to manually add items either by price or by a series of numbers that are unique to an item. It also has a ""screen"" where you can ""sign"" for your purchase if using a credit card. It does have a scanner, but it doesn't read bar codes, instead, it just adds items randomly. The interface with the cash register also is much more like a real cash register, as it gives the amount of the item and even says what the item is. As my daughter got older and ""outgrew"" the Barbie cash register (which she still plays with and won't give up due to its many, many cool features, even though she is 13-years-old), I purchased a cheap accounting calculator with a tax button and printer (for receipts), and that did a great job of teaching her about sales tax.

Overall, this is an o.k. product, but is missing a lot of the ""fun"" and ""education"" of a good play cash register. The scanning stickers are probably the most fun feature. If you are just looking for something to play with, not a toy with true educational value, then this cash register is just fine. But as a true representation of a working cash register, it is missing a lot of opportunities to make this a really fun and educational toy.",O.k. register-interface is just a glorified simple calculator and extra features are so-so,False,
B00063FE66,4.0,"My 7 year old loves this cash register.  The play factor is great with the mic, credit card and working scanner.  As a parent, there's a few things I wish were done a bit better.

As for its function, it only performs basic add/subtract functions rather than real cash register functions like creating a total, inputting how much the person paid, then showing change due.

The mic volume isn't adjustable, and while that's sometimes good, it's actually a bit too low.  You have to have your mouth right next to it in order for it to pick up your voice, and then your own voice is almost louder than the mic.

The scanner works, but only if it's lined up correctly.  If you try to scan real barcode, it usually defaults to saying $4.99.  It works by having 3 LEDs that look for a thin or thick black line, which then controls how much light goes into the corresponding three sensors.

The drawer works, but sometimes takes a really firm press of the button to work right.  The drawer dividers are bigger than real money, so there's three spots for bills and four for change - plenty enough for any lemonade stand.

As compared to other registers, we've had better and worse.  The learning resources was probably the most durable, while other ones that had a nicer mic didn't have the real scanner.  So this one sits kind of in the middle, but it's fine for what it is and our son likes it.","Maybe not the very best, but still better than most",False,

The Zillionz Talking Cash Register is a hit with them.

You'll receive bar code stickers which can be placed on items to be scanned...like cereal boxes, pretend groceries, or even hair brushes, school bags, etc...anything they want to 'buy'.  Play bills, play coins & even a credit card is included.
A microphone allows them to announce 'Clean up in aisle 2' or maybe 'Blue Light Special in Linens' or 'Price Check'. The cash register makes a 'ca ching' sound when its opened.
I'm still devising a plan for making more bar code stickers. I plan on using stickers or labels & running them through the printer.

I like the fact that the cash register can teach them how to count  in 3 different languages, English, Spanish & French.

This is a fun toy, educational & gives their imaginations free rein.","Talking cash register - teaches your child how to count in English, Spanish or French; 3 AA batteries included",False,
B00063FE66,5.0,"I have four kids aged 3-9 and probably the one game that all ages can play together is store/restaurant.  We have a small Step2 Kids Kitchen and we put this register on a stand next to that.  They were already working up fake menus and pretend money, and now they have this to put it all in.  It was an instant hit.

The register itself has an okay build quality.  I think the quality is fair for the price.  So far its handled a fair share of abuse with no problems.  My kids have had a great time integrating it into their pretend play.  Aside from being just fun I think theres a lot of learning value to having it.  This sort of thing really helps kids grasp how stores and money works.  Its the sort of thing thats tricky to explain but really sinks in when the role play it.  The scanner is a bit hokey, but we put some of the scan sticker on some old cereal and pasta boxes and the kids have just run with it.  The important thing is that they get a satisfying beep when they scan stuff.  That sort of thing is important to kids.  I don't know if the scan comes up correctly and it doesnt really matter, their imaginations fill in the rest.

So Im not sure its the sturdiest toy in the world, but I think there is real value in having it, especially if you have a small group of siblings/cousins/friends who can play together.  A much better investment than say a video game.",Great pretend play toy,False,
B00063FE66,4.0,"The Zillionz Talking Cash Register is a great choice for a teaching aid or prop for pretend play in helping children understand the importance of money and how it works. The unique features of this register such as the microphone, credit card sliding slot, and hand held scanner with sticker bar-codes to scan were huge hits with my 4 and 7 year old. The register includes play money and coins that mimic the size and value of real money. The drawer on the register opens and there are separate spots to  place the play money. The drawer makes a ding noise when opened. I did notice that the button will need to be pressed down with a bit more pressure to open as intended. I let my kids know that it tends to stick a bit and since realizing that there's been no issues with it.

There are three languages English, French, and Spanish that the register can function in. This is great if teaching children a separate language! There is no volume control option but I found the sound to be at a comfortable level. The microphone works well and sounds just like one you would hear at the supermarket! When the register is not in use, there's an auto-off feature which saves batteries. This register requires 3 AA batteries which are included!

There is a number pad on the register that functions just a like calculator. Children can scan bar codes and, add in their own prices to their total easily. I can see my family using this register for many years to come. It's a great way to teach about adding up purchases, making change, and so much more. This toy register is the closest to the real thing that I've seen on the market.

I recommend it to children ages 4 and up mainly due to the lightweight plastic and feel of the product. I don't feel it would take a big spill or rough play very well.",Great Teaching Aid and Pretend Play Register,False,

A couple years ago while looking for a pretend cash register for my daughter, i came across many registers. But which one is BEST? It's hard to say, and i suppose it would mostly depend on what features you are looking for. I ended up going with the Learning Resources register for its educational value over the zillionz.

Zillionz register features(and lack there of):
Microphone: kids can shout, ""clean up on aisle 13!""
Hand scanner: Beeps when you ""scan"" an item
Glorified Calculator: Kids have to add up everything on their own - including coins which can be hard or impossible for kids 8 and under
Cheaper feel. Pieces don't feel as strong

Learning Resources:
Coin counting fun. Has a slot to insert coins and it will tell you the amounts of each coin, as well as add them
lessons on counting - the register will ask you to insert ""$1.00""(or other amounts depending on the level of difficulty) and will tell the child whether they did it right or wrong. My daughter has spent hours playing this.
More sturdy feel. Pieces feel solid and less breakable. My kids have dropped this register off tables and chairs many times.

If i had to repurchase a register again, i would still go with the Learning Resources. The educational value is really great, especially for a 1st or 2nd grader, where counting money is introduced. It makes learning about coins and counting money really fun. We have had ours about 3 years now, and it is still working great and gets lots of playtime even after this long. When friends come over, they also love playing with that register. A great investment",Comparing pretend cash registers,False,
B00063FE66,5.0,"This play cash register is a lot of fun for my 4 1/2-year-old daughter. She loves playing with the fake paper money and the fake coins. We have put the barcodes on wooden fruit and vegetables, and she enjoys using the barcode scanner to scan the fruits and vegetables, pretending that she is working in a grocery store. This has been an educational toy, as we have had to explain the difference between paying for groceries with cash and paying with a credit card. The cash register works like a simple calculator, and it can be used to do other simple calculations. Overall, this is a great toy that can be used for education and for imaginative play.",educational and imaginative,False,
B00063FE66,4.0,"I really like this cash register. I am a play therapist, and I have one of these in both of my offices. The working scanner is a great feature. I wish the microphone was a touch louder, but overall a great product. The only reason I did not give this five stars is one of these has inexplicably started ringing everything up as $4.99. It comes with ""bar code"" stickers that are supposed to ring up at different prices. This was the case for the first 18 months of use, and now everything is $4.99. It has been played with a lot, so I can't complain to much.",Good product.,True,
B00063FE66,5.0,My son loves this cash register. The microphone was one of the things he loved the most. He enjoyed using the barcode on the cards included as well as trying to count cash and change. We also had the previous model which didn't have the language option. Hours of play.,The microphone was one of the things he loved the most,False,
B00063FE66,4.0,"My daughter already has the Learning Resources cash register (http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Resources-Pretend-Calculator-Register/dp/B00000DMD2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1433123590&sr=8-1&keywords=Learning+Resources+cash+register).

This one costs a good bit more than the Learning Resources one. This one also does a lot more. It has UPC codes that my daughter put on her pretend grocery items. The scanner scans the UPC codes and puts a price in the cash register. The UPC codes are for 0.99, 1.99, 19.99, ....., 49.99.  The prices do not work so well for grocery items, but my daughter has no idea about that anyway. After all, she is four years old. This one also has a microphone that sort of amplifies the voice.

Why only 4 stars? The first 15 minutes I had it I could not get it to work at all. I followed the directions and everything. After moving the buttons back and forth and experimenting with holding buttons down for longer times, it decided to work. I have no idea what on earth I did to finally get the thing to work. Perhaps it needed to breath or something first. No clue.

There are a few quirks you should know. First, you have to hold the open button for the cash register down for a few seconds before it opens. My impatient 4 year old found that irritating. Second, the directions say that the demo/on button is on the bottom, but it is on the back. Third, you must line up the arrows with the arrows on the upc labels and hold the scanner all the way touching it for the scanner to scan.","Quirky, but it works",False,
B00063FE66,5.0,"Usually these cash registers are pretty pitiful... but this one not only advertises some really neat features but also follows through on quality as well.

The neatest thing, in my opinion, is the bar code stickers.  It has a large sheet of them to use and at first I thought they didn't register the proper price (there are rows of differing prices from .99 to 49.99); but then I read the directions a bit more carefully and realized you have to put the scanner RIGHT ON the barcode. Then it worked perfectly!  My only complaint is that they don't sell additional sheets of these... why not?!  That being said, they have a good chunk in the box so that's fine.

The second neatest thing is the languages... you can switch to both Spanish and French. This is so cool and a great educational aspect of it.

There is also a microphone.. you have to press the microphone button while putting your mouth RIGHT UP to the microphone.. and you can play ""cleanup in aisle four"".  It's not super loud but it works and it's cute.

The buttons are basic... there are no games or anything, it basically works the way a real cash register works. If you are aware of this going in then it's just fine.

My CONS: there is barely any money included. Basically guarantees that you will need to get more.  Kind of annoying. Also, the drawer opening button didn't always work.  Other than those two, it's perfect!",REALLY neat barcode scanner that works... and speaks in three languages!,False,
B00063FE66,4.0,"I bought my daughter a different cash register last year on sale here on Amazon, for cheaper, but it doesn't do nearly the amount of stuff this does. I do have to say the quality isn't as good though. So I'm torn on this. If she didn't love it so much I would have probably given it 3 stars.

The microphone only works while holding the button down, but it's so bad you can hardly tell the difference. The voices are crisp and clear, and the money is okay, it's not as realistic as the set she already has. The door seems to have some issues when opening and closing.

So for me it's okay, I wouldn't have bought this as a first pick, but it's much better than a lot of cash registers I have checked out (I've checked out at least a dozen, if not more)

B00063FE66,4.0,"This cash register is a lot of fun for kids of 3-8.

The real plus about this toy is the scanner which scans play UPC tags (provided on stickers) so your child can put their own UPC labels on things and scan them in.  This is a lot of fun for the kids. If there is anything negative to be said about this it's that the scanner doesn't always work on the first, second or third try but eventually it goes through.

Lucky I tried the toy before I give it to my son for his 4 yr old birthday. The one I received randomly stuck with one word like ""divided by, divided by ..."" none stop.

That feature keeps my oldest entertained every time she plays with this. The microphone is a very nice feature as well and as another reviewer mentioned it doesn't distort their voices. The number pad works the same way as a basic calculator.

We save some food boxes and containers for their store.(coffee creamer cans, band aid box, butter container, etc) We made copies of the bar code stickers too so we can reuse them. Our daughter was the one that figured out it will scan real bar codes. However, the prices are random that way. We've had this register for a month now and the kids still love playing with it.

All the parts are included and he still likes the cash register, swiping the credit card etc. but the drawer sticks and needs constant pressure to get it to open.

B000B4SPX4,3.0,"I collect clue games, and have several of the UK releases also.  I was excited to see another edition of Clue being released, and when Santa didn't bring it, I ordered it for my family.

We played it for the first time tonight and first of all, the age range says 10+, now I have a very advanced nephew but I cannot even imagine him grasping this game.  The 3 adults who did play this game had trouble figuring out the rules.

The 10 cases, are ALWAYS THE SAME, ie when you have played all 10 cases, there is no point playing them again, leaving only general play.  Will they release more DVD's for this game and at what cost to us, who already spent nearly $40 for it in the first place.

The rule book was very vague, to say the least. We ended up just showing all our cards to each other to finally figure it out.

The clues given by the butler are slightly obscure, but we have learned after the first case that you must LISTEN CLOSELY, REPEAT, PAUSE, and WRITE IT ALL DOWN!  From these clues you are ""supposed"" to deduct certain things and check off multiple items/locations/times/suspects.  This the part that I don't think a 10 year old could grasp, when 3 intelligent adults couldn't.

There is really not any point of even using the game board, w/the 10 cases  you have very little interaction with the board.  It doesn't make it clear when to move, what ends your turn, and w/3 players, after you run out of item cards from the butler, the board is useless.

After the 1st case, they did explain how we were to have deduced the clues given by the butler and the inspector, which will help in solving future cases, but I'm not sure whey they didn't just give you an example on the DVD in the first place.

We have not tried general play, but I did read it is just like playing regular clue, only you also have the DVD interaction.

My suggestion, if you are a clue fanatic and collect the games, then buy it, although I'd check eBay for a cheaper price.  If you do not have the patience to ""wait"" for the DVD to trigger an event and are used the old style play, don't waste your money.  I'm not unhappy I bought it as I do collect them, but I wish I would have paid a lot less.","Too Much Money, Not Enough Game",False,27

There are a lot of choices that need to be made and people were confused about the game play. I was disappointed in this game and will just stick to board game clue from now on!,Very confusing game,True,
B000B4SPX4,4.0,"This is a fun game once you get the hang of it.

That is the key, getting the hang of the game. As other reviewers mentioned this game has a learning curve to it and it is not the easiest game to play right at first. This is not something an 8 or 9 year old will easily be able to do by themselves.

Once you do understand how it works the game is quite fun and although it is very similar to the old Clue this one is different. You have to figure out four things and there are more options (Something like 10 options) under each category. You will get extra clues from players, from the dvd butler and maid and from watching little clips on the dvd.

My ten year old loved the game and thinks this is better than the normal clue game. My 8 year old daughter would rather  play the original Clue game over this one. I grew up playing Clue so this was a lot of fun.

I think it is correct, as one reviewer did, that if you are a Clue fanatic you will probably love this game. IF you like puzzles, solving riddles and want something a bit harder than the original Clue you will probably enjoy this game. However, for many people this may be a bit too much and not worth the effort.

Enjoy","Low Four, High Three. Fun.",False,
B000B4SPX4,3.0,"No review here really explains how to use this DVD system. As you can see, many reviewers (including this one) were confused by the operation of the DVD.

It's important to note that the DVD does not drive the game or follow along with the game. The DVD does not track whose turn it is or where each player is on the board. When you first start the game the DVD will only light up two options: ""use a secret passage"" and ""make an accusation."" You won't be making accusations until near the end of the game, so the only options seems to be the secret passage and that's confusing all of us. The other options are all gray.

I just spoke to HASBRO today and the lady mentioned that you may have to play 15 or 20 minutes before the DVD starts doing anything. You just play the board game like normal at first, you don't use the DVD at all after it instructs you how to setup the board and game play begins. After several turns you may use the DVD when you are in a room where you want to use a secret passage. The DVD may tell you that something unexpected happens while you are traversing the passage. Eventually after possibly 10s of minutes, the DVD may do something. The DVD works on a timer. The DVD senses how much time has passed and starts yielding the clues as time goes on. What will happen is that as the DVD just sits there on the options screen, seemingly doing nothing other than looping thru its music and watermark animation, it's actually counting time. It assumes that you are playing the Clue game just like normal. At some random time interval, the DVD will come to life and the inspector will say ""I would like to see you right now."" Then you can use the remote control to answer the inspector and he will play a clue for you. After that he may turn on one of the other options like ""call the butler"" and then you may start using that option. As the game progresses more of the options will become available.

To answer some concerns that other reviewers have mentioned:

It should be noted that a DVD is of limited intelligence. It's not a general purpose programming medium so it can't be as smart as a normal computer program. It was never intended to do anything as smart as play a game, so it's only clever programming that gets it to simulate the intelligence it needs. As such you shouldn't expect too much out of it.

The 10 fixed cases in the Clue DVD game allow custom animation. For example, if Miss Scarlet stole the broach at midnight, a dramatic animated scene can be scripted such that Mr. Boddy tells of how Miss Scarlet tried on the broach and he knew that she was an incorrigible night owl. For this kind of content the fixed cases are a must. With a normal computer program it might be able to shuffle predetermined scenes or lines of dialog to match a random case, but the DVD is not that smart. So the fixed cases are a compromise of allowing nifty Clue scripts to be played at the expense of having a finite number of Clue cases on the DVD. The DVD also includes a random case but that's not going to feature the custom story line and animated snippets. It's going to be more generic.

You could just play regular Clue with it, you don't have to use the DVD. Compared to Classic Clue it's a deluxe game with the cute dolls, 3D colorful game board, and the expanded possibilities. Compared to the standard Clue game this one is missing the weapons so that's too bad. If you don't like the expanded possibilities because it makes the game longer, just eliminate some cards at the start.",It's nifty.,False,
B000B4SPX4,4.0,"Clue dvd is a bit more involved than the original board game. It takes a while to really sort everything out and make sure you know what you're doing.

All your favorite characters are here, plus some new ones and you actually get to keep notes which are more like clues given by the 'inspector' on the dvd.

We first got this when my son was 9 months old (he's now 11 1/2 mo) and he loved to kneel and play with the buttons and the shape sorter. Gradually he learned how to pull himself up and stand while playing with it. Now he pushes it around the room and squeals with laughter because he is walking.

There is a stopper on the back that prevents it from tipping backwards which is really nice. The wings of the plane fold up so when he's walking around, he doesn't get stuck against the furniture. When the wings are down, they serve as a footrest while my son rides on it.

As the batteries die, the music gets slower and more warped. I thought it was a defect with the toy, but changing the batteries fixed the problem. Like most kids toys, the battery area is screwed shut.

B000EX0DRS,5.0,"This is my son's favorite toy in the world. I got it for him for his first birthday back in July and i couldn't have gotten him a better toy.

It has withstood his slamming it, throwing it, kicking it, riding it, hitting it, and all other types of abuse and it just keeps on ticking. It has been through two moves and nothing broke or chipped or anything. So I gave it a high durability rating. He is just starting to ""get"" the idea behind the shape sorter. He doesn't really care, but they're nice to teach him colors and shapes.

The fact that the seat comes up and he can ""hide"" stuff in there is neat too. He won't really ride it too much, but I think that's a personal thing... He likes to push it around and ram it into the closet door. Still no damage, the paint hasn't even chipped off...

He likes the lights and the songs. The propeller is his favorite thing ever. The lights dance around and make different patterns as it spins. That's kind of neat. The propeller is made of a really soft foam; so when the kids inevitably stick their hand in there it doesn't hurt them. It will stop if they try to stick their hand in there and it doesn't break or anything. I really thought he was going to burn out the motor, but no. WOrks fine. He will dance to the music. So cute. the songs get annoying, but the fact that it is occupying him trumps the annoyance of the repetitive music.

There are no small parts for me that seem like it can fall off but may parts that look like it can break.  However the little one had already overhead thrown this plane several times the same day since it was opened and the sound and blinking lights still work.  He has also kicked it too and its still running great. This is an awesome product.  Size is lot smaller than what I expected ---- I thought it would be 8 in long but it is about half the length.

B000LFUGY4,5.0,"This is an AWESOME kit of Tamiya's 2-1/2 Ton Cargo Truck in 1:35 scale. This kit came out in the very late 1990s. Kit also has multi-media parts meaning that the kit has plastic parts, clear plastic for the windshield, thread for the tow-winch, and hard rubber tires. Tires can be made to actually turn!!

Fit of kit was EXCELLENT!!! Probably one of the best kits from Tamiya that I have ever built. I did not have any fit problems of any kind. Kit practically built itself, it was that well crafted!! There is a very good rendition of an engine; excellent detail for the oil pan and drive train and complete undercarriage and exhaust system. Bed of cargo area has positional seats and bows for a tarp (not included).

Good interior of crew cab has steering wheel, pedals, and stick shifts (actual 2-1/2 trucks are quite barren). Excellent crew member also included and has great details and facial features. Clear plastic for the windshield and I positioned it using white glue (Elmer's glue). Just to be different, I scribed in some lines to make it look like the windshield has some damage.

Instruction sheet gives a brief history of the 2-1/2 Ton Cargo Truck in multiple languages and suggested paint and decal guides. Also included is an awesome history of the ""Red Ball Express"" - hundreds of cargo trucks of various sizes that were given the mission to transport desperately needed fuel and other supplies from the Normandy Beachhead to the quickly advancing Allied Armies. Vehicles of the ""Red Ball Express"" were primarily crewed by African American soldiers and served with great distinction and were vital to the success of the ""Red Ball Express"" and the advancing armies. The ""Red Ball Express"" is legendary in American military history.

Decals are given for 5 different vehicles and went on model without any problems. There are some minor accessory parts such as packs, fuel cans, spare tire. I wanted to fill the cargo bed with 55 gallon drums and used some after market kits. Shortly afterwards, Tamiya came out with an excellent accessory kit consisting of 55 gallon drum and 5 gallon fuel cans. Tamiya also came out with another accessory kit consisting of a .50 Caliber machine gun mount. Also, Tamiya's old kit of US soldiers in various sitting poses would be excellent to fill in the cargo area as well.

The US military 2-1/2 Ton Cargo Truck was so successful in its lifetime that it actually served the military until being finally replaced in the early 1990s. I remember operating one of these (though modified for the times) in the 1980s while stationed in Germany. Vehicle could go just about anywhere.

Overall, EXCELLENT kit. I rarely rate model kits as 5 star, but this kit built so well and fit was so good, just had to give the extra credit. Remember, this is a plastic model kit and construction is required. Paint and glue not included.",Aesome kit of WWII 2-1/2 truck.,False,5

B000N8LVJ8,3.0,"My 3yo absolutely loves this! She's not ready to do it on her own, so this is something that we do together. Here's a list of pros and cons about My Collage Farm.

Pros:
*Lots of craft materials
*Colorful
*Fun end product to hang on the wall
*Provides good bonding time
*Good for creativity
*Helps develop fine motor skills

Cons:
*I hear that other Alex crafts are well organized and have the projects separated. Not the case with this one. Most of the supplies are loose or in a bag with similar supplies, and not at all packaged with the right craft.
*It says it has simple instructions. What it has is a small square paper that shows the pig before decorating it + crayons and glue + squiggly eyes, hat, button, pipe cleaner, and crepe paper = decorated pig. The decorated pig in the instructions has a whole lot more on it that what was shown in the ""instructions."" And how do they get the plastic button, googly eyes, and pipe cleaner to stay on with a glue stick??? I'm still trying to figure out what will make those things stay on without making a mess and making the pipe cleaner stiff from the glue.
*We were trying to follow the pictures on the box, since it didn't have adequate instructions. But the things pictured on the box aren't necessarily in the box, and there are things in the box that aren't pictured on the box. I realize they must be trying to help develop creativity, but I'm one who likes to have instructions to follow.
*The box is a tiny bit too small for the animals, so they end up a little bent at the edge.
*Not at all fond of those finger crayons. They don't color well. The colors are not at all vibrant. And if your kid has sensory issues like mine and mouths everything, all it takes is one little bite to break the tip and expose the finger. And then it's hard to color with.","Fun for 3yo, not so great for Mommy",True,2
B000N8LVJ8,5.0,"Everything is packaged in separate projects, very well organized. With very little supervision my 6 yr. old was able to put these together. Great rainy day or daddy-child projects.",These are amazing little kits.,True,
B000N8LVJ8,2.0,"This set is sooo disappointing!  I love the other Alex kits, specifically the bug set and sea critters lacing set.  This one just stinks!

First of all, the different animals are not divided into kits, and no instructions are provided.  So you get a box of a lot of pieces of random colored paper, tissues, googly eyes, stickers, feathers, pipe cleaners, etc, but no clue on how to use them.  You end up with a small child grabbing at everything and making a random critter with a huge mess.

The other Alex kits that divide into separate sections are much better for a busy mom.  Also, note that once this box is opened, there's no way to organize it all.

The stickers in it are like superglue, there's no way to reposition them if the kids stick them to the wrong spot, which is sort of likely for this age, so things just go wrong once you open the box.",Buy a different Alex set!!!,True,7
B000N8LVJ8,5.0,"My 2-yr-old and 4-yr-old had fun with this, and it kept them busy. If you have more than one child who will be playing with this, I suggest you pick up an additional glue stick so they do not need to keep passing it back and forth. This would be a great gift for a child's birthday, to keep on hand for a rainy day, to put in the suitcase for summer vacation for moments of down time, or to take to a relative/friend's house to keep your child occupied while you relax.",Great variety,True,12

B000OV79QS,4.0,"I bought the Petal Cottage cradle and changing table for my granddaughter who is 2 1/2.  It was the perfect size for a babydoll, but not big enough for her to climb in and get hurt.

B000OV79QS,4.0,"Yearly update Dec 2009:  WE still have the cradle in the orginal condition and still loved.  The changing table did not make it the first year but that is because my child spilled her sippy cup on it and it changed the color of the table which annoyed me greatly.  I was never too impressed with the changing table though and always liked the crib.  As for purchasing it again.....I doubt I would as I have seen beds that I would like better for the same price as this set and as stated earlier I was never extremely fond of the changing table.  I still think it is durable though as it has been played with quite often this last year and still looks new.

I bought this when there was only a few reviews.  I was worried because of the cheap cheap cheap review.  It is made of fiberboard but it is sturdy and thick fiberboard and almost feels like plastic.  It took an entire 5 minutes to put together and has been man handled by three kids carrying it up and down the stairs with out any issues.
I am only giving it 4 stars because I absolutely love the cradle but the changing table is lacking stuff.
1. I wish it came with two blankets one for the table and one for the cradle.
2. The changing table is just a block....would like a drawer or something since it does take up space but really serves little purpose...but the kids seem to like it anyhow!
3.  the cradle is so small compared to the changing table....I just find this strange (the cradle barely fits a standard doll in it while the changing table has lots more room.
4.  None of the other three matter since the kids love it and have turned it into two cradles.......wish you could just buy the cradle though!!

As for being cheaply made.....I highly disagree I was very suprised when I put this together as it seems extremely study and has been moved numerous times with out any issues.  Hope this helps!!!",I think it is very durable!!  It is cute too,True,

I don't think kids need all that bulky stuff on them do they can hardly move. Having said that, the costume is really not super great quality. But what are we expecting really? It's will be worn less than 5 times probably. The helmet bothers me because all they have to do is add more Velcro & it would stay together better.

The belt runs a little big, and couple that with my very skinny kid, and I have to use binder clips to keep it on because it way overlaps the velcro.  But, that's an easy workaround, and you can't see the clips under the cape.  My only complaints are about the helmet.  It just kind of wobbles all around on his head.  I wish it was a little bit more fitted somehow.  And even though he's a skinny little dude, my kid has a big head, so kids with smaller heads (aka...normal sized), might have a little more trouble with the helmet wobbling around.  I also don't like the limited visibility.  The material used for the part they see through is really dark and I'm not sure how he's going to be able to see at all when we go trick or treating, so that is a concern.  But, the costume looks cool, the kid loves it, and I think he'll be wearing it for dress up for at least the next year or so after Halloween is over.",Cool costume,True,

B000VUF3O2,4.0,"I've been using Venom batteries for a while now, they've always been solid performers, at a decent price.

So why not five stars?  Their proprietary connectors are awful!  They were awful back when they introduced them, and they're still awful.  It takes a lot of effort to attach them, which is fairly understandable, you don't want them getting loose when you're out driving/flying your RC!  But, good luck removing the connector head!  I couldn't do it without damaging the removable part, which was damaged to the extent that it was no longer usable.

Furthermore, some of the connectors don't fit well.  The Traxxas style connectors have always been too tight;  Once you connect them, it's painfully difficult to disconnect them, which isn't an issue with original connectors.  Which is why I just cut these connectors off and solder original connectors of my choice on.

So if you're thinking you can get these and swap out the connectors, forget it.  And don't be surprised if the connector you attach doesn't fit well.  Aside from that, again, these batteries perform well, and are reliable.","The battery itself is great, the proprietary connectors are terrible!",True,2

I liked the cord on the corner instead of the middle so we ordered another one when the first one went missing.  The second I ordered from another Prime shipper called Toysonics and it had the cord in the center like the video.  Bit disappointed as the center cord is a pain to get in and out of the vehicle.

The price is a bit higher than you can get comparable batteries for.  In the mean time I had bought a Dynamite Reaction 2S 20C 5000 battery several dollars cheaper and it has a faster charge rate (3C vs 1C).  The Dynamite Reaction battery has done just as good for me as this one also.  The Reaction battery also has the cords in the corner where they are more convenient.

I tried to cancel the order after buying the better cheaper Dynamite battery but it was too late to cancel.  Amazon wants over $6 to return this one.  No big deal I guess as I'll just run this one, but with the cords in the middle it will be a bigger pain to get in and out.

If you want to save a few bucks and get a battery with the cords coming out of the corner get the Dynamite Reaction.  If you don't care about the cord location or paying a few dollars more this is not a bad battery.  Then again your mileage may vary on the cord location as mine did.

Either you get a pair of cherries for the family basket, or the raven moves a space to the tree with a ""caw caw"", or you set a little animal aside face up to continue sleeping. If your tot wants to keep their card till the end, so be it!

B001UFQNF0,3.0,"This is probably the best toy Delorian made to date and I put the emphasis on TOY.
If you are buying this for a child, they will probably love it.
It's big enough to fit 3 3/4 inch action figures.
It has various sound and light effects.
The dash along with the flux capasitor inside the car light up which I think is a really good feature.
The Mr Fusion comes with the car but not in it. You have to install it.
Quite easy but also quite unnecessary.
There is no point in making it removable.
The movable wheels and opening doors give this car the charecter of the original.
A child could play with this for a while before getting bored.

As a Collectors item DON'T CONSIDER THIS OVERSIZED CHEAP SUNSTAR RIPOFF.
At 1/15 scale this could be nothing but a childs toy.
Made of plastic
Poorly constructed, the hood or bonnet does not set in flush.
The lights only come on when you push the button.
It does not have a display lighting mode.
You cannot mute the sound and enjoy the light effects alone.
The detail in this model is So So,
There no Delorian name plate or logo found anywhere on the car which make it even more of a ""bootleg"" product.
This car feels light and flimsy.
The door panel and seats can and will pop out.
The wheel movement is sloppy.
The paint job is off, It does not look like steel.
Anything below 1/18 is toy territory so don't expect a model car collector to be able to appreciate this gigantic 1/15 size plastic toy delorian.
If Diamond Select had put display lights on a properly detailed standard 1:18 size diecast model without the annoying sound effects, They would have had a winner, but as it is, they made this ""thing"".
Sunstar and Welly are the model brands to have.

Requires a screw driver with a small head to remove the product from the box. (Why????) Just makes your kid be more annoying waiting as you try to remove the product from the box.
[BTW: Know-where on the box does it say you need a screwdriver to open the product]

#2) Trains don't fit... (The Real Kicker!!)
Half the trains my son owns don't fit in the cleaning part of the track, only small engines work. So products Learning Company makes them self don't fit in their own product for the same wooden railway system. Really????

So for all future buyers... DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!

B0036MDNVM,5.0,"Realistically, the figurine looks exactly like the picture, and up close, you can see all the effort that went into precise detail work,from the molding to the paintwork. I think it is kind of funny in a way though, because unlike your classic reptilian European dragon designs, this one has more of a doglike face, lol. Anyways, this is a regal looking dragon, and I very much like it. As a 30 something year old child, I appreciate it sitting on my desk shelf and sometimes just sit there admiring the design. However, it is made from that same rubberized plastic that makes it incredibly durable. I'm gad to have this piece.

She LOVES this and it's her new ""nighttime"" toy.  The little moon lights up.  It has three buttons - off, a ""short"" little song such as (""Naptime's here, my eyes, they close..."") and then either 10 or 20 minutes of lullabies or nighttime music.  The little ""Blankie"" is removable/washable and threads through the moon to stay put.  My daughter is 10 months old.  She puts the blanket up to her face and uses it to soothe herself to sleep.

B0038APCXO,5.0,i bought this for my granddaughter who has trouble staying asleep. She takes scout to bed with her and loves it! The music options are nature sounds or lullaby songs and given length of time from 10 or 20 minutes. She doesn't seem to like the light on. So I would cover it with his blanket.,great purchse,True,
B0038APCXO,4.0,I thought i'd take a chance on this item even though I thought it was rather pricey for what it was. I am glad I bought it though because it is really soft and I like that my son can listen to the melodies and watch the moon softly glow as he falls to sleep. The only thing i'm unsure about is that it seems a bit loud for a night time toy and I didn't see a volume control button. I will have to look again and update when he's not currently asleep with it. Additionally I do wish the on/off button and the timer button weren't on the front where he could easily turn on/off but maybe this will be a good thing once he's a little older and knows he wants to turn it off instead of doing it by accident.,Expensive but cute for a bedtime buddy,True,
B0038APCXO,5.0,"My daughter is now about 6 weeks old, and she has loved this toy since we brought her home from the hospital.  Scout resides on her changing table, which is probably why it's her favorite place to be.  She loves the light up moon and the lullabies are pleasant and keep her attention.  This is the first toy she ever cooed at and it usually calms her down during difficult meltdowns. It's small enough to take with us in the carseat and stick in the bassinet when we need her to be content for a few minutes.  Happy baby and very grateful parents.",Her favorite toy so far,False,

B0038APCXO,5.0,My daughter uses this every night and I love that it plays lullabys and they have a ten minute or twenty minute setting. It has nature sound also with the same settings and the soft glow of the moon is just the perfect amount of soothing light.,Scout,True,
B0038APCXO,5.0,My 14 month old loves this little puppy and the soothing sounds lull her to sleep. She also holds on to the blanket a lot and likes to constantly press the buttons.  I like that it shuts off after a length of time. Great product!,Love little Scout!,True,

B0038APCXO,5.0,"We received this toy as a gift, and my 1-year old loves this puppy.  We keep it in her crib as a night-time comfort toy.  It plays soft music and lullabies and helps her relax and is a part of our standard getting ready for bed routine.  I love that you can choose 10 or 20 minutes of music, and the batteries last a long time even with every day use.  We don't get any use out of the ""blankie"" that comes with the puppy; I think it is a silly feature and don't like the dangling ties that are meant to tie the blanket to the puppy.  However my daughter loves this toy so much, it was still worthy of 5 stars.  I just keep the blanket in storage in case she wants to play with it when she is a bit older.

B0038APCXO,3.0,"This twinkle twinkle Scout is so cute and cuddly! My son is 8 1/2 months, and loves to press the buttons and turn the music on. The moon lights up and the attached blanket is really soft. I actually wish there was an easier way to attach the blanket because my son just rips it off and tosses it around, but it is convienent if you need to wash it. I like how you can switch between 10 and 20 minutes of either lullabies or nature sounds. He loves his full sized Scout, and this is just as cute! I wish it was customizable like the full size Scout though!

EDIT 07/21/2012: Well I do have to edit this a little. A few times my son has rolled onto this toy while sleeping and the Scout voice starts blaring ""HOW ABOUT SOME BEDTIME MUSIC"" with fake yawns, and it has woken him up! My husband made me take it out of the crib after it woke him up at least 3 different nights. Maybe it'll work better when he's older and out of the crib.",Nice companion during bedtime!

We babysat a neighbor under 1 and she had this today, my little girl played with it the whole time she was here and now we've had it for 3 months.
She loves it.
It's not annoying. It's got nice, calm sounds for going to sleep.
My little girl already knew her eyes and other features, so she loved it that the dog asks her where they are.  She also sings along.
I would buy it if we didn't already have it.",Love the dog,False,
B0038APCXO,5.0,"My son loves this little dog, he'd hold it in his  car seat and listen to it in his crib.  The colors and lights are interesting enough to get his attention if he's fussy, and soothing enough to not get him all riled up at bedtime.

The only thing I can say might be a bit of a downside is the voice that tells you how long the music or nature sounds will be playing is a little low and sometimes hard to hear if he's crying.

I rated teh fun and educational value a little low because this isnt' that kind of toy, but it's fantastic for what it does.",Great sleep aid,True,
B0038APCXO,5.0,"The Scout is small and cute. Very well made and it will make a great baby shower or anytime gift.

I love it because of the lullabies. It became a staple in out bedtime routine. I like the 10/20 minutes option for the music.

Also great distraction during diaper changes;)

B0038APCXO,5.0,"I have a friend to thank for introducing our son to Little Scout!  I have now purchased four of these and one Little Violet (Scout's ""sister"") for a friend who is having a little girl.  It is a great addition to a crib to help ""self soothe"" a child back to sleep.  He is even portable enough to bring on trips, on planes and in the diaper bag.  Buttons are easy to push and there is a volume control switch inside the body.  The songs and nature sounds are not obnoxious (trust me, I would know - we live in a small apartment and I hear this toy about five times a day).  Great gift and quality product.  Thanks Leap Frog!",My son LOVES his Scout!,True,
B0038APCXO,5.0,"A friend of mine purchased Little Violet's ""brother"" Little Scout for my son when he was having trouble sleeping through the night (around age four months).  Scout was a perfect addition to his crib.  Now, at age 10 months, he turns Scout on by himself to ""self soothe"" back to sleep.  I purchased Little Violet for a friend of mine who is due at the end of this month.  A well-made toy with volume control and easy-to-press buttons.  I only wish Violet was as cheap as Scout!

The second only lasted 2 months before the same thing happened!  I called the company, and they kept repeating their stupid company policy over and over again.  The would replace it (if I had the receipt!) but would not refund the money because we did not buy it from their store.  Problem is, I need it immediately because my 18-month-old cannot sleep without it!  I will not be getting anymore Leap Frog products for this child or any other!!!",Piece of junk!,False,
B0038APCXO,5.0,"My daughter was given this as a Christmas gift, and I love it! We don't use it for the ""educational"" words at all. There really doesn't seem to be much more than a few snippets of counting. I love it for the lullaby music it plays. It has settings for 10 or 20 minutes of lullabies and 10 or 20 minutes of environmental sounds. We use the lullabies, but I'm sure the environmental sounds are great too. I sometimes have to restart it for a second 20 minute set, but it helps sets the peaceful sleep time mood for my daughter. Also, it is very soft for her to hold and chew on. I took off the blanket that comes with it and don't use it at all, but it is a cute idea. My daughter (5 months) likes to look at the lit up star, a good distraction if she is fighting sleep. Violet sings a little nap time or going to bed song, and I think they are both adorable! I do wish Violet didn't talk before the music started because it is a little louder than the songs and sometimes wakes my baby up a bit if she is almost asleep and it needs reset. Otherwise, this was quite a surprisingly useful Christmas present!",Plays music for a long time,False,
B0038APCXO,4.0,"First off, this is very soft and cute.  Perfect size for our small 20 month old daughter.  There are just a few things I would change.  First, it should come with a volume control, sometimes it seems very loud.  Second, when you have it on the timed settings it seems to change randomly and can be startling (one of the nature sounds is a train going on tracks and has startled us a few times).  Might be better if it played more constant sounds.  Over all I would recommend this, our daughter likes this and it does seem to help her get to sleep.  We also have the ""Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Soothe and Glow Seahorse"" which is quite and soothing, but not as cute.","Very cute, but could be better.",False,
B0038APCXO,5.0,"I had my doubts about this when Grandma bought it but it turns out that my baby loves it! She has had it since about 15 months and seriously goes to sleep with it at nap and bedtime. It's easy to push the buttons, so she can turn it on herself if it turns off.

Pros: 10 and 20 minute settings, volume control. Blankie can come off.

Cons: The velcro is easy to open, so she can open it and turn it up when I turn it down. The nature sounds well.. they are weird and not really something desirable but they do work and she will fall asleep to them.

B0038APCXO,5.0,My baby and I both love this toy.  It is sweet and creative and the songs are catchy rather than annoying.

I bought it on a promo last Christmas for $10, so they are willing to lose a customer over $10.  I'm sure if I paid $10, they still made money.  Pretty sad if you ask me.

This Violet is cute, its sometimes will wake her up though when she is sleeping with it and accidentally rolls over the music setting..it doesn't just play the music, it has to announce it is going to play music for some reason.  Just like the bigger dog Violet, my daughter, now 3 will still on occasion pick her up and sing along, but isn't an everyday play toy.  This one, in my opinion, is not as versitle as the bigger Violet, you can't customize her. Still she was a gift and my girl does like her.

My daughter would often wake up when her other crib music would stop at around 10 minutes.  20 minutes is perfect.

If you bump it even slightly (and hello, this toy was meant to be handled by young children so it always gets bumped), it starts with those words again.

My 9 month old really liked it and when she would wake up from a nap she would play the music.  this only lasted 6 months,  i changed out the batteries and it never came back to life.  I will re-purchase it because it is really nice, this time i will register the product with leapfrog so that if it dies again at least it will be covered.  the blanket is tiny so we put it away, it wasn't worth having to track down a wash cloth size blanket for the dog, but it was a cute idea.",A good bedtime friend,False,2.0

My husband and I put it together, it took about 20 minutes and then another 10 of putting on all the stickers.  It was fairly easy to assembly and is oh so cute.

I search high and low for the right tool bench for our son and these are the things I love about this one.  First the little vacuum, it may seem odd, but my son is all about putting small objects in tubes and other odd spaces.  The great thing with this, he can put stuff in the vacuum tube all day long and it falls to a little bin on the shelf below, this will be hours of entertainment for sure.  Secondly, I love all the storage, there is a large bin on the bottom as well as a large door on the right hand side, the cute little bins for small things, like screws and such.  As well as the small overhead bin and a drawer.  It comes with a few great tools.  I also wanted a little tool belt, so I bought a separate set that came with more tools.  They all fit in just the drawer, so there is much more space for everything else.

I also love the size of this, it feels big, like a lot of work space and things to do, but compared to some of the other ones that I was looking at it is small which is great.  We love space savers.

I would recommend this toy for any little boy or girl that likes to imagine!  Can't wait until Christmas morning.",It was fairly easy to assembly and is oh so cute,False,

B003ZFSOZU,5.0,"My 3 (almost 4) year old son got this on Christmas morning & was thrilled.  I, myself, am thrilled with anything that encourages creative play & this does it.  My little man (& his 2 year old sister) keep building and fixing things with this tool bench.  I've seen bird houses, airplanes, and all kinds of other ""wood""working happening.  I love that it has a light to turn on and off, a drill that actually ""works"" and screws that have a function.  This DOES require some assembly.  It took my husband and I about 30 minutes working together on Christmas Eve (when all we wanted to do was go to sleep), but assembly is pretty straight forward.  You will REALLY WANT an electric screwdriver when assembling this unit since you do have to punch your own holes when screwing parts together.

Mostly, my kids just put things down the tube, while you can get them out, I would not say it is super convenient to do so.  It is very sturdy!!!

B003ZFSOZU,2.0,"This was given to us as a gift.  And I wasn't too thrilled about it but thought we could give it a chance.  Now it just sits here and collects other toys and stuff because we can't get rid of it for fear of someone saying, ""where did the workbench go?""  Anyways, I didn't mind assembling it and all BUT shortly after my son, who at the time was three years old, stared playing with it, the overhead light stopped working (I'm not about to take it all apart to replace the battery in it, because wouldn't you know it ain't a simple fix and is completely inaccessible unless you take it all apart), the drill broke (not because of rough play but because it's junky) and the pieces of foam and bits and bolts just littered the playroom.  Now I diligently watch my one year old find such things and the never ending baby-proofing continues on.  Fast forward to my four year old who has absolutely no desire to put together something made out of foam...give him a real hammer and a chunk of wood and his imagination runs wild for well over an hour, sometimes two.  He walks by this thing many times a day and never gives it a second look.  It was in for a about a week. Or until the silly still broke and the dim light ceased to glow, even a tad.

This is great for parents who don't mind having heaps of garbage and plastic permanently littering the house...give the kids some REAL toys that will make their mind exercise. And yes, good grief...you may have to supervise them and teach them something along the way. But it's worth it and the kids love it.  Okay, I'm done my bah-humbug rant.  But seriously, do your kids a favour and actually show them how to use real tools.  Not mitre saws and air compressors...just hammer in a couple of nails into a chunk of wood and give them a little hammer.  They might get a boo boo, but they're learning and they're using their hands and minds the way they're meant to. They go bananas when they aren't forced to play with the never ending plastic ""pretend"".  Or maybe I'm just a bad mom for thinking my four year old is capable of using something that isn't plastic or padded.  I can't wait to get rid of this boring thing.

My son is able to use his imagination, but for the price of this, it would have been better to have some sort of sound to go with the vacuum.  Also, the hose is a little rigid.  On a positive note, my son loves the light and the pull out drawer.  Also this is no fault to Step2, but my cats love to take and chew the foam ""wood"" pieces that come with it.

B003ZFSOZU,2.0,"Maybe I would have rated this higher were my expectations not let down. I was looking for a functional work bench for my son who is obsessed with tools. There is no purpose for the screws- nothing to screw into. The holes in the table are too big which I had assumed was the purpose of putting holes there. The drill, while it makes noise does little else. There is just nothing functional about this. the foam pieces are cool in concept but unless you are building the few designs it comes with the pieces are so irregularly cut you can't just make something up. And the screws (which should be nails since you need the hammer to get them into the foam-again, pointless screws) are difficult to get in and out. But my big disappointment is the shop vac...  How hard would a sound effect been for the high cost of this toy. A light- that is my sons favorite part. Boys want buttons and things to manipulate. What a let down.

B004I5B2I2,4.0,"This is the new trackmaster Tidmouth Sheds that came out in the summer of 2011. I had been scoping this out forever but it was always so pricey I kept waiting. I thought they had stopped making it and my only recourse would be buying one off ebay. Finally it appeared on amazon at less than half the price I normally see it when it's used. This is a redesigned Tidmouth Sheds. I do not own the previous one made by TOMY nor the ones with remote control vehicles. The previous version of this with remote controls got poor reviews - people said it kept falling apart. Even so I was willing to buy it and try to rig it up somehow. Imagine how excited I was to see this! Well we just got it, and I don't see how it could fall apart without some major abuse. It must have been redesigned to make it more durable. The turntable itself is not motorized, the train spinning it's wheels on the turntable causes the turntable to spin. Then flip a switch at the right time and the train proceeds down the track.
The turntable is big enough for the larger trains with attached coal cars (Gorden, Henry, James) to fit, however the straight track where the trains 'rest' inside the shed is not long enough for these trains to close the door. If the door is not closed the turntable will get stuck on the open door. This can be easily remidied by add another short straight track behind each door making them longer but I feel like it's something the manufacturer should have forseen. Trackmaster Henry, Gorden and James have coal cars which can't be removed. These are core characters and anyone who buys this item most likely has one or all of them. Most people who buy this probably have some extra straight track lying around and can easily fix the problem, but it is still a flaw. Then there's the problem of Emily, who's detachable coal car is the only motorized piece. When Emily hits the turntable she keeps going until her coal car hits it, and the coal car starts the turntable spinning and Emily gets mangled and stuck. So, I guess the shed was definitely not made with these larger engines in mind, and that costs it a star because these are all major characters and the manufacturer should anticipate consumers would own more than just Thomas if they're investing in Tidmouth Sheds.
Other than that minor problem this is a great item! No problems that I see like the old version with it falling apart!

UPDATE: We have now owned this for a few months, and in that time several children under 15 months have ""played"" with it. Pushes and shoves and mild tripping from my 3 year old did not demolish this in the beginning. However, after the babies disassembled this >10 times, it seems to snap together weaker and weaker every time. Now mild tripping from my 3 year old WILL disassemble this. It's not too hard to put together, but I did decide to put it away for the time being. The babies discovered the doors to the shed are easily removed. They are pretty small and roundish. I don't feel comfortable having it out with a baby who puts everything in his mouth. I know, the train wheels also are a choking hazard, and I limit that as much as I can too! Anyway just know that if your kid is rough with this or it gets disassembled several times, the locking mechanisms will become weaker and it will be easier and easier for it to fall apart. So, perhaps this was not redesigned. Tough to say since I do not own the original versions.","Oh my, great fun!",True,26

B004QCCPMY,1.0,"Purchase this device two weeks ago and my son has barely been able to play with it due to issues with the Learning Lodge Navigator and ""my downloads"". First device was defective and had to be exchanged. After we replaced the first device, we purchased a storage card and games from the download center. Unfortunately we have been unable to transfer the games to my son's device since it is not appearing in ""my downloads"". I called Customer Service twice to resolve this issue. The first representative hung up on me after I sat on hold for 10 minutes and trouble shot with him another 10 (It was obvious he was reading a script and did not listen to anything I tried to tell him about my issue). The second representative had me on hold for 15 minutes, was able to identify the issue as a global Vtech issue that needed to be resolve by their development team but he had no idea when I would be able to access the downloaded content and even suggested that I not make any more purchases to avoid any additional problems. When I inquired on a credit for more downloads because of the inconvenience the representative kept stating it wasn't his problem to resolve. I realize that customer service is often outsourced off shore but there is no excuse for their level of indifference and apathy. They tried to rush me off the phone, cut me off repeatedly and hung up on me. When I made the comment that it's obvious they don't care about their customers but that there are no other options for us for resolution, the representative the just asked me if there was anything else I wanted. What I want is for my 3 yr old to be able to use this device! He was so excited and it has been nothing but a complete and utter disappointment. I have never had any issues with any of the Leapfrog devices we own and their online resources are superior.  If it weren't for the fact that I purchased the storage card, I would be returning this Mobigo in a instant. What a complete waste of time!

Since there are pages of games to buy, all at different age or development levels, you have to have a way to store them. Yes, the storage system is very pricey when you look at the cost of the system as a whole. However, if you break it down by cost per game, it is very reasonable. I bought eight games, spent fifteen dollars on them, stored them for play on the cartrige and the cartrige is only a third of the way full. For me, it is very worth it.

B005HN4HRM,5.0,"This is a review on S H Figuarts' Super Saiyan Vegeta. This was actually my first SHF figure, which set the standard of excellence that is this toy-line. Super posable, and the detailed with awesome shading. His boots for example look great.

Out of all the DBZ figures this one is the least expensive, an for a reason. Vegeta comes with the least amount of stuff. When compared to Trunks it's almost sad. I picked Vegeta up for around 30 bucks which is a veeeery good deal. Included along with Vegeta is a spare face, and two sets of spare hands. That is it. (Trunks comes with 7 sets of hands, a normal head, SS head, 8 faces, 2 swords and a sheath)

This figure is in scale with the other SHF DBZ figures. Taller than Gohan, while shorter than Goku and Piccolo. His hair is pointy, so watch out. Safety first! I wish this came with more, but as I said this figure was less expensive so I get it.

Yeah, buy this figure you will not regret it. I recommend this figure, but only to collectors. This is not a childrens toy.",Final Flash!,True,
B005HN4HRM,3.0,"Ah, the prince of Saiyans. A much longed-for figure, especially in Bandai's highly esteemed SH Figuarts line. As it stands, this is the best representation of Super Saiyan Vegeta in figure form. Does that mean it's perfect? No; no, not really.

First, let's get to the great parts of the figure. The articulation is the standard articulation for SH Figuarts (that is, supreme), though I'm not sure if the boots are die-cast. Because he's in his Android/Cell saga garb (?), the simplicity of the design leads to a more fluid and uniform joint design. Unlike Goku, who had to incorporate the uncovered parts and the wrinkled clothing, Vegeta's aesthetic blends well with the joints. His knee and elbow joints, for example, look like knees and elbows, etc.
He comes with one more facial expression than Goku, so that's obviously a plus.

Now, on to the detractions. From what I gather, the DBZ Figuarts line is up and running largely because of the Western fans. Indeed, Trunks and Cell were created because of Facebook polls. Starting with Vegeta, the DBZ Figuarts have become Tamashii Web Shouten/Shop exclusives in the East, and standard releases in the West. As such, that may be the reason why these figures come with less accessories and overall detail than other Figuarts counterparts. If that's the case, I can't really blame Bandai for factoring in cost vs. value, but that doesn't mean I excuse these DBZ figures completely.

Let me reiterate: the SH Figuarts line comprises the best DBZ figures you can get in this scale (1/12=6""-ish). They have the best articulation and sculpting, and, even though some are lackluster in including accessories, they have the better share of accessories nevertheless.
But Vegeta (as well as Goku) got skimped with the accessories. They don't included paired hands, meaning each hand doesn't have its counterpart in the same pose. So where we'll get Vegeta's right-handed (or left) blast pose, there's no same pose for the other hand. As it stands, there're about four or five hands *total,* which is a darn shame.
His facial expressions come with fixed eye angles, so if you want to show an extremely upset or powering-up Vegeta, he's always going to be looking to the side.

So far, I have SS Gohan, SS Goku, and SS Vegeta. From what I can tell, they're all in scale, though Vegeta may be a bit taller than some may like. In the DBZ world, he and Frieza have vacillated a few inches, so that's not a deal-breaker for me. What is bothersome is that Vegeta seems to have longer legs than I'd like. Maybe that's to enhance his articulation, but I can't help but be bothered by it. Call me anal.

I got this figure second-hand, though it's claimed to be new. I notice a paint splotch on his hair, but it's not too big a deal. The neck joint also seems to be loose on mine, so I'm careful when posing this figure turning his head. I also noticed that his boots aren't colored yellow at the tips, but that doesn't bother me as much as it might some fanboys.

All in all, it's the best SS Vegeta we've got, but not the best DBZ Figuarts. Comparatively speaking, Gohan is the best in my ownership, seeing as he comes with multiple faces and paired hands, as well as SS and SS2 hair styles, not to mention the cape. The cape is stiff, but what can you do.
I've seen Trunks also comes with a slew of accessories, thanks to FB polling, so let's hope the future figures get as much care. Frieza is the one I've been wanting, so I hope the best for that one.

I've noticed that Vegeta is now sold out, so if you really like the Saiyan prince, and you're not bothered paying double his retail ($40), I'd take a few deep breaths before saying go for it. It's not as bad as it sounds, but I'm not 100% impressed.
However, it's SS Vegeta; who doesn't want him?","Best Vegeta, but not the best DBZ Figuarts.",False,2

B0064EI1KC,5.0,Storytelling made fun. I think this idea of the picture cards is great. There are several ways to play this game. The cards are double sided and you can play by building your own story with a set of 6 cards or by sharing a story together. For example everyone takes 4 cards and puts them in a pile in front of the and I start off my story with the first card from my pile and the next person must continue my story with whatever card is first in their pile. It is fun because the kids are not competing against one another and because some really funny and silly stories can be made with the pictures on the cards. It is also great for kids to learn how to express themselves and speak in front of others. Sometimes at bedtime instead of reading a book to my children I let them pick out ten cards and I make up a story for them. And the great thing about these picture cards is that your story can be in any language.  At bedtime I sometimes make up a story with the cards in Spanish because my youngest child does not speak English yet. I would highly recommend Tell Tale.,Imagination Expression,True,3
B0064EI1KC,5.0,"Our family has been a huge fan of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dixit/dp/2914849656/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dixit</a>&nbsp;and love giggling and trying to figure out how each other is thinking.

So when I received a copy of Tell Tale to check out for a review, I was a little skeptical because we have had such a good time playing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dixit/dp/2914849656/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dixit</a>&nbsp;and they seemed similar.

However, there are similarities in that they both have picture cards to begin the game play and they both stimulate creative thinking but from there, the games are different each have their own strengths.

There are many options for using Tell Tale and I'm sure with a little parent or teacher imagination, the possibilities for uses are almost endless. But the gist of it is to take a picture at random and begin a story. It can be a single story told by a parent at bedtime or a group story in round robin fashion. We've been playing by passing out 5-7 cards to each player and then going round robin style with each person turning over a card and adding to the story. This creates some very convoluted situations. Today we had a vampire traveling the world who was changed by a witch into a chicken that ended up having super charged powers creating lighting strikes of power. It was our super chick chicken kind of story. Sounds odd, I know but the point is that my 12 year old son actually took his nose out of his book and joined in and we all laughed as the connections became weirder and weirder. With more practice, the connections become more detailed and 'plausible' as a story line but often, children will go with a one sentence contribution. The point is that they are working hard to remember the story from start to finish while trying to keep a cohesive plot line running (and all the while laughing and giggling about how silly some of the story twists become.)

I like this game (and I call it that loosely because there is really no scoring or winner unless you choose to pick the best storyteller during game play - which personally, I don't want to do) because you can play it for 5 minutes or an hour. You can have two people or 8, there is no right or wrong, just quick on your feet thinking and interaction with all involved. I can see it being used in a classroom with each child getting a card and having to work it into the class story.

As with Dixit, the pictures can become repetitive after awhile. So I hope that Blue-Orange games takes note to offer add-in card sets like Dixit has done with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dixit-2-Expansion-Set/dp/2914849680/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dixit 2 Expansion Set</a>.

At this price, around $11, this is a great gift idea for a birthday party, a great Friday game night addition, or teaching tool. But don't expect it to work for you, you have to do the work to make this game fun!

I received a copy of this game for testing and an unbiased review.",How Do You Turn a Chicken and Dentures into a Story?,False,
B0064EI1KC,4.0,"Entertainment is something you do, not something you watch. If you believe that, then Tell Tale could be a good one for your family. The format is simple: about 50 circular cards, each with a different image on each side. In play, take some sequence of pictures and make a story out of it. No wiiners, no losers, no one keeps score - for once, the game really is about enjoying the game itself. That, and letting little imaginations run wild through the endless possibilities of different pictures in different orders.

The game comes with a few different ways to dedide which picture defines the story's next moment. Players can alternate cards, or build longer stories on their own. Pictures can be decided by random shuffle or by the opposing player. And, once your child gets the hang of it, I'm sure you'll be told new variations on the rules.

'Tell Tale' comes in a sturdy metal can, small enough to keep in a purse or coat pocket for travel or for other impatient moments. The cards seem heavy enough to withstand eager players, and the surfaces look like they'll resist minor messes and cleanup. On the whole, it looks like a great way to fire a child's imagination - and to instil the idea that everyone is a storyteller, or can be.

B0064EI1KC,4.0,"Game: Tell Tale, by blue orange
Teaches: Creativity, Thinking Skills, Imagination, speaking and listening skills

Tell Tale comes in a small round tin. The game contains instructions and 60 double sided cards. That is a total of 120 images to use for building stories. The instructions give you some examples of different ways to use the card in building stories. SmartyPants and I usually use these two card in two different ways.

1. I deal 3 cards out to each player (usually just the two of us, but sometimes Daddy plays, too.) Then we take turns picking one of our cards to create a big story together.

2. I deal a 7 or 8 cards to each of us and we each have to tell a story using at least five of the cards.

At first, SmartyPants had a hard time with this. His stories would go something like this: Once upon a time there was a cowboy, and then he saw a boat, and then he saw a key, and then he got a letter. He had a dog named Spot. The End! He's gotten a lot better, but he still has a way to go.

My one year old loves these cards. We use them for vocab practice. Dog! Baby! Potty! She participates by choosing her favorite cards and making me work them into our stories. Tell Tale is definitely one of her favorite games.  Overall I would definitely recommend this game to anyone with children ages 4-10. Younger children may enjoy it as well, it depends on the child.

Pros: Fun, Educational, Develops Thinking Skills, Develops Imagination, Portable.

Cons: Potty humor very likely, there are a couple cards I don't like, and the pictures could possibly get repetitive (we haven't had this problem yet).

Megatron has his trusty arm cannon along with a cool purple energon blade that attaches to the arm in robot mode and on his arm cannon in spaceship mode. The energon blade attaches securely in both modes. The poseability is outstanding with great stability for creating cool battle scenes or displaying where you please. The durability is excellent as well with secure joints and a solid build in either mode as well. The transformation level is easy meaning if you have plenty of experience with transformers there is no difficulty. If you are a parent buying for a child of 5-6 they should be able to handle the process. If you are a Megatron fan this is the one cyberverse version that is a must have.

B006CD3844,4.0,"Picked up Deadend today and found it a fairly good toy. It is, admittedly, a repaint of Wheeljack with a new head sculpt, but the coloring is strikingly different. He has an intricate transformation that wasn't particularly difficult, I actually enjoyed it, but a young child might get a little frustrated. The range of motion and articulation is good, if not amazing and the gaudy color scheme really helps him stand out from the original Wheeljack mold (not to mention the new head sculpt is completely different). He seems a little more durable than some of the other Prime toys, but I can't accurately attest to it since I don't really do much more than fiddling around with mine (mostly they sit on a shelf), but the plastic gave me the impression it wasn't quite as flimsy as some.

B006CD3844,5.0,"This is a figure I really didn't plan on picking up but, it was $8 bucks at  Big Lots....so...why not. I have always been a fan of the Stunticons and though they do not combine in the Prime Universe, I love the new spin Hasbro has introduced on them. Though we only see one in the show (Breakdown) Hasbro released Dead End and Takara released Wildrider....oddly enough using the same mold which more often than not Im opposed to. But they both look really cool. So onto the review for Dead End.

Dead End transforms into a Lancia Stratos and sports a black,Bright orange and lime Green color scheme. Which in my opinion is horrid. But in the Bio it states he basically walks a thin line of being a terrorcon and staying sentient due to over exposure to Dark Energon....ok...so hes kinda toxic in a way. I see why Hasbro chose this color scheme. Of course in nature some of the most deadly creatures have some off the wall colors. Needless to say I got used to the colors real quick. Dead End rolls nicely and holds together quite well too. His ""laser swords"" (thats what the card says...pretty cliche huh?) Can store either on his rear fenders, attach to his front bumper, or (ashamed to say recently discovered on my part) underneath his vehicle mode. I think the sword storage on the front bumper works out a little better on Dead End. I could see Dead end using this to his advantage trying to push an Autobot off a high cliff and in the process scratching some paint too! More so than Wheeljack ever would. Overall for vehicle mode...the colors take a bit to get used to but when you get into the mind set that hes rathet poisonous....it makes things a little easier.

Transformation is exactly the same as Wheeljack. Still super fun. Parents,Like Wheeljack this is a great figure for your children requiring little to no help. And you will have fun too. In the event either you or your child has some difficulty please refer to my fellow TF heads Peaugh or Optibotimus on youtube. These guys not only review the figure but they will walk you through the transformation step by step with figure in hand. Like Wheeljack this is a well engineered transformation.

Robot mode...I really don't have to much to say other than Its the same as Wheeljacks. Other than the newly sculpted head. And it does look scary. I can see why both the Autobots and Decepticon fear Dead End. This sculpt is pretty darn artistic too. It really conveys the feeling of endless pain,agony and rage. Though not G1 reminiscent in any way...its still a great head sculpt. Dead End is very poseable, holds together great, and stands great as well in any pose you can think of.

While this figure isn't one id recomend to drop everything you're doing and go buy it now...if you see it and you're a fan of the Stunticons,a completionist,or buying for a child I would recommend picking him up.",Transformers Prime: Revealers Dead End,False,3

B006ROJIQU,4.0,"The first time I played Seeland with my kids I was not terribly impressed with the game. Impressed with the quality of the construction, yes, but the game just did not seems very interesting. However, we tried it a couple more times and it got much, much better. This is in line with many European Board games. If you know Settlers of Catan or Carcassone you will be familiar with the learning curve some of these games involve.

The game board comes with two sides and the instruction booklet gives you a beginners version and a more expert version of the game. The beginners version was useful as we figured out how to use the actual game - there are no dice or cards invoved and you have to learn how to use the system set up on the game board that lets you know which pieces go to which player, etc. Once you do figure it out, I highly recommend flipping the game over to the advanced side and playing with the advanced version. This is when strategy becomes important and the choices made by each player impact the game play for the other players.

Score keeping is easily done on the perimeter of the board (similar to Ticket to Ride). The quality of the game pieces is good with some being carved from wood.  We've seen the deterioration of our Settlers of Catan game that used flimsy cardboard and I am glad that the board for this game is much higher quality than Catan. When playing the beginner version I did feel that the limited number of tiles made the game end too quickly. However, my guess is that there will be expansion packs and extra tiles available in the near future if the game is a success.

I played this game with a 11 and 7 year old and liked the fact that the kids used their mental math skills to add up to 5 different numbers to add up their scores. Also, a discussion of the dikes and land reclamation in Holland is sorely lacking in the game booklet, but the history of dikes and polders and the use of windmills (central to the game) to pump out the seawater can make the game more meaningful. The game can easily lead to an excellent discussion of the historical period when the Dutch Merchants had a huge impact on world finances and a discussion of the Tulip craze in Europe.

So, a fun game that takes a few tries to learn it but is definitely worth the effort.",Excellent quality and playability,False,
B006ROJIQU,4.0,"I have become a big board gamer in the last 10 years.  Commonplace stores sell only the games for the general public, the Sorry, Life, Monopoly, Stratego, etc, although Target is branching out thankfully with such titles as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ticket-To-Ride/dp/0975277324/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ticket To Ride</a>&nbsp;(recommended) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zooloretto/dp/B000S0PY2G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zooloretto</a>&nbsp;(recommended if you want to deal with all the little pieces to sort for gameplay).  I got this game as it is considered a 'gateway' game in that it isn't hard to learn and play.  The rules are well written and easy to follow.  I played it with my 2 daughters (ages 11 and 16), they immediately picked it up and the 11 year old ended up winning.

  The game does take about an hour to play, especially if it is one of your first times, that includes set up and clean up. It is very colorful, and it is well made.  The details are noticeable, the nicely colored tiles, the wooden figures for the windmills and player pieces.  I was also impressed with the 5 or 6 baggies it came with to store the pieces in. You appreciate those because next time you want to play the game, the landscape tiles are already separated from the mill tiles.  Game play is quite straight forward, on your turn you move the guild-master piece, take a tile which is either a mill tile or a landscape tile, place the tile, and if it that tile completes your mill, you score it for points.  To complete a mile, it just needs to be surrounded by tiles.  Nothing confusing to bog you down.  There are the small details that if you get a mill tile  it must go by developed land and if you get a landscape tile, it must go buy one of your active mills if you have one.  Still, the rules are simple and this game is a glorious step up from the random, roll the dice games that you may have been playing.  It might actually cause your kids to think and plan ahead.  Still, the theme, being a Dutch mill merchant in the 1700's isn't going to excite kids as much as Jedi wars or something like that.

There are 4 game levels you can play because the game board has a front and back to it, the basic game and tactical game.  You can also add the Governors and Records expansion if you want.  Both of those are very basic and don't change the way the game is played, but can add to your scoring ability.  Clearly, if you are new to this type of game should play the basic game, and then add the governors and records addition once you get the hang of it.  We played straight off with the governors and records as it made the game just the tiniest bit more competitive.

  In this game you can mess with your opponent, or you can just focus on your own mills. I like that in a game, my kids can't handle it very well if I beat them down in a game by destroying what they are trying to accomplish, so in this game, you can focus on your points and let them focus on theirs.

  Still, because my kids have a lot of different games under their belt, this game did not WOW them, it is a little dry, but considering the  quickness of the game, the ease of learning it and how pretty it really is, I still give it 4 stars.  Also helps that my mother was born in Holland and this involves Dutch stuff, so that is a plus.  We do have other games we will pull out before this, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pompeii/dp/B000NDQ0WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pompeii</a>&nbsp;(yes, involves the volcano and saving people),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pastiche-Toy/dp/B004QJG85C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pastiche [Toy</a>] (a game about art and colors), and one of our old time favorites&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lord-of-the-Rings-Board-Game/dp/1589947061/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lord of the Rings Board Game</a>&nbsp;(played this 2 times in 2 days!).

  If you have the opportunity to play this game, do it, if you want to buy something new, definitely consider it, but realize there are tons of games out there, just check out the themes and complexity level before you do.","Entertaining, but is the tip of the iceberg in games",False,
B006ROJIQU,2.0,"This game is the fourth Ravensburger game I've picked up through the Vine program in the last several months. Of those four, I like this one the least. It's not all bad, of course, but certainly not as much fun as the others or as much fun as I expected it to be. It's difficult for me to rate a game poorly when I really wanted to like it, but I'll just be honest: Neither I or my family enjoyed playing this games. To be fair, here's my list of pros and cons:

PROS:
1. As with all Ravensburger games, the production quality is very high: sturdy construction, aesthetically pleasing illustrations, multi-language instructions, plastic baggies actually included for storing all pieces in an organized manner.

2. From an educational standpoint, the game has some real value. The game, itself, is a lesson in history of the Danish empire, geography, and agriculture. Never a bad thing to learn something useful when you're playing a game.

3. Play length isn't terrible. You won't be working at this game all night, like some games, and most families prefer games that take an hour or less to play.

CONS:
1. The instructions are not as thorough as they need to be. Maybe something was lost in translation? I don't know, but I sure had a few unasnwerable questions when playing this game. Consequently, we had to come up with our own ""house rules"" to determine what would play  best, make the most sense, and be the most fair in these circumstances.

2. This game took a long time to learn to play! As with most new games our family purchases, it falls on me to be the one responsible for learning to play the game and then teach it to the rest of the family. I spent a couple of hours running through a sample game by myself, learning how to play it and continually refrencing the rulebook. This isn't uncommon for a lot of ""euro-games,"" but the pay-off is usually better than it was for this game.

3. There are quite a few very small pieces in this game that could be lost very easily. With many children in the house who often shuffle through the games closet, I worry about this sort of thing. For others, it may not be as pressing a concern. Though it seems more ""durable"" than many games produced in the USA, I had to rate its overall durability a bit lower due to the tiny pieces.

4. Play length isn't great. It took my family about 90 minutes to play through this game the first time. Sure, times would be shorter in the future, but I find it hard to believe this game could be started and finished in less than an hour. One hour is often too long for my family unless the game is really fun. Which brings me to my last criticism...

5. This game just wasn't much fun. Both of my older children and my wife told me that the game was too boring and that they didn't want to ever play it again. I, myself, found it lacking in that key component of any great game: fun. Any game that isn't fun isn't going to be played repeatedly, and that describes this game. It's too bad, but there it is: we just flat-out found the game to be uninteresting, so two stars is the highest I can rate it.","Not really very much fun, unfortunately,,,",False,2.0

On your turn, all you do is choose how far ahead to jump in rotating circle of options, the further you jump the more advantage you might give your opponent, but it might be worth it for the perfect resource you want.  Strategically place your windmills and try to set them up for big point combo's when you fully surround them while also trying to hold the other opponent back the best you can.

B006ROJIQU,5.0,"The basic premise for this game is that players take turns placing windmills and surrounding them with crops. Players score points for windmills only once they are completely encircled with crops. There are several other games with this surround and score concept (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samurai/dp/B00005UNAU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samurai</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alhambra-The-Gardens/dp/B000EXYYWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alhambra The Gardens</a>) and fans of that style will likely enjoy this game as well.

There are some crops already on the board that players try to grab and these can be turned down or left visible for a slightly more strategic game. It also has a governor variation that has the mills aiming for specific point values. We've found this game to be a solid addition to our collection and the pieces are sturdy with wooden pawns and thick cardboard for the board and coins.

The only thing I'd question is the age on the box says 13+. My 9-year-old can play it with no trouble. The mechanism for choosing crops and windmills (the giant circle you see on the game board) may be a bit daunting for anyone who thinks Mad Gab is a real game, but if you've mastered fiddly games like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Power-Grid/dp/B0007YDBLE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Power Grid</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shadow-of-the-Emperor-Board-Game/dp/B0009GII40/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shadow of the Emperor Board Game</a>&nbsp;this one will flow pretty smoothly, certainly less complex than Settlers. And it's very well thought out. Instead of using money, players circle the board as they ""spend"" to skip the less desirable items and can never be more than four spaces ahead of anyone else.

B006ROJIQU,4.0,"I was able to round up a table full of game-players recently to help me try out Seeland.  My family is a game-playing bunch...think games like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Settlers-of-Catan/dp/B000W7JWUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Settlers of Catan</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Agricola/dp/B001C7617Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Agricola</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dominion/dp/B001JQY6K4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dominion</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ticket-To-Ride/dp/0975277324/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ticket To Ride</a>&nbsp;etc., not to mention more traditional games like Scrabble, and so on.

Anyway, over the Christmas break I was able to gather a group of family members to help me try out Seeland.  After playing it 3-4x I now have a good grasp of the game and feedback I can share on it.

Game premise:  In this game you are a wealthy Dutch merchant/farmer, and you are competing with other merchant/farmers to drain land and grow crops.  You do this by building windmills and then planting crops in spaces adjacent to your windmills that you have drained.

Points are accumulated as you buy plans to build windmills and seeds to plant crops.  After playing the game 3-4x I started to see more of the nuances of the strategy of this game.  If you wanted to you could be a real pill by planting crops in places that will advantage yourself and disadvantage others.

Frankly, the explanation about how players' tokens move around the marketplace needs some improvement, but we were able to figure it out fairly quickly.  Confusion came into play when the directions indicated that you are supposed to move coins as players move their tokens.  In the end we figured it out.  And after playing the game once or twice we caught the rhythm and flow of the game.

Everyone who played it the first time was willing to play it again a day or two later.  So there is some draw to the game.  When I asked what they thought of the game, they all said that they enjoyed playing it, but that it lacked some of the more or less addictive appeal of games like Settlers of Catan or Dominion.  That is, they liked the game, but they were not just dying to get another game of Seeland running.

All in all, this is a good game with a good premise.

4 stars.",A solid game...good enough to attract a table full of players at my house more than once,False,3.0
B006ROJIQU,5.0,"Seeland's a relatively simple game that's inspired by the history of the Netherlands. You act as a wealthy merchant looking to make use of recently diked off land to harvest one of three crops: lettuce, rapeseed and tulips.

(If you're looking for the short version, scroll down to the subtly titled ""SHORT VERSION"" section below!)

The basic mechanic involves each player buying and placing mills and then attempting to surround those mills with crops to collect points. Unlike a lot of the games I've played that rely on a points system, the points you earn while playing determine who wins--in other words, no surprise wins as a result of end-of-game bonuses.

Each player's turn starts with them purchasing a mill or a bag of seeds (represented by cardboard tiles). This is the mechanic I mentioned in the title of this review. Reading the manual, I was confused at first, even with the examples. Part of the reason for this was the inclusion of Stuivers (effectively pennies of old money) which are just there to let you buy an extra turn (more on this in a second). Once I sat down to play it, it started to make more sense.

You move a guild master token around a circle. The circle has spaces for mills and bags of seed along with a warehouse. Landing the guild master on a space lets you take that item. The ""cost"" comes from the number of steps around that circle the guild master actually moves. The first step is free. Each additional costs a ""coin"". The coins are cardboard markers set in an outer circle where each player's token also resides. There are five coins. As a player you ""buy"" guild master moves by moving clockwise around the circle of coins. However, you can only move to a space with a coin on it. It's sort of like the coins form a range over which you can move. The coins are moved forward once the last player vacates a coin (after a move).

For example, let's say you want a mill that's three spaces ahead of where the guild master is right now. That means you need to move your player marker TWO spaces (remember, you get one free) forward on the outer coin circle. You can't go past the last coin so if you're already at the last coin, you can't move more than one space (and you're required to move). However, if you're on the first coin, you can move up to six spaces (5 plus the 1 freebie). Like I said, it takes a little getting used to (we were used to it after a few moves though at least one person needed to be reminded a few times just because it's nothing we'd ever seen in a game before).

Once you're past that phase, you take the mill or bag of seed and place it on the main map. There's a starting village where all the players get a ""free"" mill to start but otherwise, you can place a new mill as long as you have one of your four mill tokens to play. Same thing goes with the bag of seed though you have more freedom as to placement since you can really just place those anywhere that's open.

The way you score points is to completely surround your mill in fields of crops--as best you can. For example, if you're on the edge of the map, you only really have to place 3 or 4 fields, depending on where you are, since it's based on a hex-grid. Once you've surrounded a mill in crops, the mill's owner gets the total number of points displayed on each crop as well as the mill tile their mill token is sitting on. The rules dictate that if you have only one type of crop (e.g. lettuce) when harvesting, you actually don't collect any points (basically promoting diversity). The trick is: if you place a field that also finishes surrounding another player's active mill, they also score points.

In addition, if you place a mill next to one of several island tiles, you flip those island tiles(nothing to buy, you get them free) and benefit from free fields or a village. A village gives you no points but gives you one of those Stuivers I mentioned. The Stuivers are strategically important. You get one at the start of the game and can gain more by revealing those villages. The Stuiver can be traded in at the end of your turn for another turn. This feels a bit like cheating (and in a way you could argue it is) since you can pull off some nice maneuvers where you pick up a mill plus the fields to complete it all in a single turn or pick up two vital fields that finish off an existing mill. This sort of maneuvering is especially important at the end game because of what I mentioned earlier: there are no bonuses at the end of the game. If you're in the lead and the game ends, you win.

The game ends when the guild master lands on an empty space (not including the warehouse which lets the player who puts the guild master on it move back three steps on the coin circle). This can be unintentional (you have to move after all) or intentional (you're in the lead and you want to finish the game to win). Since there's a limited number of mills and bags of seeds/fields, you will run out at some point.

NOTE: We didn't play the ""advanced"" variant that's included with the game. Maybe once we're used to the game enough, we'll graduate to that and I'll update this review. :)

SHORT VERSION:

All in all, it's actually a nice game to play. Beyond the purchasing mechanic, placing mills and fields becomes a great chess game of sorts as you decide where you can place a mill to quickly surround it and grab points or debate whether it's worth gaining a lot of points with one placement that also means giving some points to an opponent. It also ends up moving along pretty quickly once you're set up and playing. The only real issue beyond learning the purchasing mechanic is set up. There actually a decent number of islands so if you haven't already sorted your tiles, it takes a bit of time to organize and get it all set up (I'm talking 15 minutes...it's not like it's hours or anything). Once organized, though, it's not as bad.

If you're looking for an interesting game with a bit of an educational slant thrown in, this is definitely worth considering. It's one of those games that look simple but can involve some complicated strategy if you want to go there. It's not a complicated game and doesn't involve much randomness (except for the shuffled tiles) so those of you who shun die rolls and coin flips will probably like this game.",Nice game if you can get used to the purchasing mechanic,False,3.0

B006ROJIQU,4.0,"The game: You develop your windmills by diversifying resources and scoring points. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins!

There's always an option, even if it isn't the best one for you at the time, so you don't ever waste a turn. Then, you place your piece on the board strategically to give yourself points and try try and thwart your opponent if possible.

The components: Seeland has great wooden pieces and a nice thick board, which shouldn't come as surprise to those who know about Ravensburger.

B006ROJIQU,3.0,"During a vacation with another couple, we brought about a dozen board games along.  Seeland was the last game we tried, as it just looked really complicated.  Reading the rules didn't help much, but we decided to jump in anyway.  Within a few turns, Seeland actually turned out to house a fairly simple ruleset, and was easy to understand and play.  We all caught on quickly, even going into it being very weary.

Seeland is kind of a like a boardgame version of 'Minesweeper'.  You build mills and uncover possible opportunities by flipping over tiles beside the mills you build.  This can lead to bigger crops (more points) or more moves, more mills, etc.  Some of the language is a little confusing.  The pieces are very well made and should last for years to come, as seems to be consistent with Ravensburger titles.

Initial set up took a few minutes longer than the average board game, just due to the sheer number of parts and pieces.  We finished our very first game in about 45 minutes, but no one enjoyed it enough to want to play a second game right away.  There is a decent mechanic for player cooperation in the form of a marketplace.  It's hard to buy things if someone is too far behind, and its hard to play while staying too far behind!  The scoring is fairly easy, with a scoring chart running around the outer edge of the board.

I've had a chance to play this game several more times and I want to slightly amend my original review below.  I've seen a few negative reviews of this from experienced players and I think I know what the primary problem is.  For experienced gamers Seeland is definitely not for more than 3 players.  Two is actually the ideal.  The more players there are the more random the result is from the rondel.  If you're a serious gamer then definitely consider this only if you play 2p.  If not, then I'd agree to give this one a pass.  For those who play mostly family style games this is still a great game.  The directions make this look far more complicated than it is.  It's actually pretty simple.

END OF UPDATE

I play hundreds of new games a year, most of them what gamers call Euros.  Many of those games, quite honestly, fall a bit flat.  Many are more than fine, of course, but few really excite me.  I own more than 300 games and many of those I keep just because I know others enjoy them.

Seeland is one of those great exceptions to all of the above.  It's a great game.  The theme is a bit thin - draining the land of The Netherlands to create farms - but it's there nonetheless.

I do want to emphasize who this game is for.  Have you played Settlers of Catan?  Did you like it?  If so, this game is better.  Not just a little bit.  A LOT.  It doesn't have the negotiation aspect, but it does offer more strategy and less luck, especially with the more advanced rules.

Ditto what some have said: The rules are not that great and there's far too much room for confusion given how simple this game really is.  Just take it slow, follow the set up instructions, and then follow the rules.  A turn basically only has two steps with a possible third.  One, buy a tile.  Two, place the tile.  Three, score if applicable.  There are many rules beyond these steps, but that is essentially the game.

If you're already a more serious gamer then I have one name for you:  Wolfgang Kramer.  We're talking the designer of El Grande, Tikal, Torres, Slide 5, and many others.  You can tell this is a Kramer game.  If you like Kramer I'm going to bet you'll love Seeland.

B006ROJIQU,5.0,"Here you go: one of these strategy games with the dynamic sort of board and little hex shaped pieces that YOU can actually play! And it will still be fun for your nerdy cousin who is always trying to get you to play these things. Now, let me warn you, the instructions will SEEM complicated. First, you should know that the book contains instructions in many different languages; the part you actually will use is only 4 pages, unless of course, you want to read them in several languages. Second . . . they aren't quite as clear or precise as they could be. I almost wonder if you knew Dutch or German if the instructions in those languages might be more clear. But persevere!
I like to scan instructions and then play through the game referring to them constantly. Do what works for you, read through them 5 times, have someone else read them, whatever. Just remember: They make the game seem more complicated than it is. Just play it, and you will see it is very straightforward and once you play through one game, you will likely never refer to them again. It REALLY is that simple. But dynamic and fun!
Also, try to find a couple people who have been to the Netherlands recently to play with; it will help when you need to decide turn order. *wink, wink*
Also, gameplay time is reasonable- maybe an hour for that first game, less for future games.
Once you get the hang of the basic game, there are an additional 4 pages of instruction for a more complicated game and another section with more historical information, making the game more educational . . .  if that is what you are going for.

B006ROJIQU,4.0,"Seeland is an intriguing game that is going to take a few more plays to get a full sense of. There is also an advanced game version which I'll update this review with later. For now, however, this will just cover the basic play.

 The narrative is that you and your fellow players are living in 17th century Netherlands, much of which, unfortunately, is under water.  Your task is to purchase windmills with which to rain the land and then raise some crops (cabbage, tulips, rapeseed) on the reclaimed soil.

 That's the gist.  The windmills and crops exist as tiles and each tile has a point value ranging from 0 to 7. Also on the board are island tiles, which when turned over will reveal either a crop or a farm (farms allow you the opportunity to take extra turns).

 The shared market where you purchase your windmills and crops is a circle with an interior track and an exterior track. The interior contains the stalls where you can purchase either a crop or windmill.  Also on this track is the ""Guildmaster"" pawn.  You move him around the track until he lands on the stall with the tile you want to purchase. The exterior track contains the players' pawn and ten circles, five of which are covered with a single guilder coin (these five are consecutive).  You purchase your tile by moving your pawn the same number of spaces you moved the Guildmaster, not counting the first move (moving the Guildmaster one space costs nothing).  Your movement, however, and thus your purchasing, is limited by the fact that nobody can move past the fifth guilder.  Once the first coin in the sequence is finally vacated (when the last player on it moves off of it), it (and all other unoccupied guilders behind the last player) is moved to the end of the line and becomes the new limit.

 What this means is that sometimes you can't get what you want, and sometimes you can either prevent someone from getting what they want or even make them take something without choice depending on how many guilders you've left them to move across once you've move the Guildmaster.

 Once you've purchased a tile, you must play it. If it is a mill, you have to place it on an open board position that is adjacent to an already placed tile (a crop or another mill).  You can then choose to ""claim"" it by placing one of your four merchants on the tile. If you purchased a crop, it must be placed next to a mill or another crop. When one of your mills is completely surrounded by tiles (crops or mills--yours or other players'), you ""harvest"" by adding up all the points on the tiles and scoring it, then removing your merchant from your now completed mill. You gain a bonus if your harvest contains at least one of each crop.

 One last complication is that some board positions are taken up by ""islands"". When you place a mill next to an island and claim it, you turn over the island.  On the other side will either be a crop (played as all other crops) or a farm. A farm garners you a ""stuiver"" coin, which you can use to take an extra turn after any of your turns (you can only play one stuiver per round, so you can't take more than two turns in a row).  Just as with the movement of the Guildmaster and you merchants around the market, there are some clear strategies at play in your tile placement.  Placing mills next to islands can garner you lots of extra turns if you're lucky or extra crop points, sometimes you can place a mill so when an opponent completes their own mill they will also complete yours for you, sometimes you can disrupt an opponents harvest, and so on.

 Eventually, you run out of tiles, both mill and crops, and the game will end.

 Our first game (me, my wife, our ten-year-old) was a little confusing (directions were mostly clear but not always and sometimes we had to read a bit between the lines (also a few typos), we realized we hadn't played it correctly (and that my wife had been moving my son's pawn) and decided to try again the next day.  Our second attempt went much better and the game really started to become quite compelling as we slowly started to realize the subtle ways in which we could manipulate our opponents' moves that came after ours.

 The positives are the level of thought that goes into both purchasing tiles, selecting tiles, and placing tiles.  Each element takes some careful thinking.  Another plus is that both the purchasing and placing have aspects of strategy (your decision-making) and luck/randomness:  what lies under the islands is unknown and random, and what tiles end up in the marketplace (you replace tiles from shuffled piles as you purchase them) is random and a matter of luck. For instance, you want a cabbage so as to get the bonus, but no cabbage appears on the board, or if it does appear, it's too far away for you to reach.

 The cons are the lack of interaction between players.  You could, if you so wish, play the game without saying a word to each other.  The ""narrative"" is pretty abstract in terms of actual play--I can't say I ever really felt I was doing something other than placing tiles to score points.  How much anyone cares abut that is pretty individual--I'd call it pretty minor.

 Gameplay lasted about an hour but I'm sure that will get knocked down as we get more used to the strategies. Our ten-year-old picked it up fine, though its subtler strategies in terms of purchase may have passed him by. He did quite well in the tile-placing strategy though.

 I can't say Seeland is one of our top games--we're huge fans of the Dominion games and I'd say this doesn't compare.  I'd also rank Forbidden Island and Castle Panic above this. In terms of style, it's very similar to Carcossone or Days of Steam, but certainly more complex than the latter and possibly the former--still thinking about that.  But this game definitely grew on me as we played it and will certainly become part of our rotation, if not as much as some others.","solid four--grows on you, thoughtful",False,2.0
B006ROJIQU,2.0,"This game just wasn't that fun at all. Despite the company's efforts to make it less labor intensive, it required a lot of moving things around the board repeatedly just to create a play, like moving coins repeatedly for no reason whatsoever. Setting up this board was a pain, and in the end it was just not fun to play. There wasn't much strategy involved, so each game was just like the one played before it. Also, I think kids would be very bored with this game, especially when there are others on the market that provide education in a fun way.",save your money,False,
B006ROJIQU,5.0,"If you take a look at my reviews, you'll see I own approximately 11 billion Ravensburger games.  Okay, that's kind of an exaggeration, but the bottom line is that we, as a family, are Ravensburger enthusiasts.  For quality of construction and appeal of the games, they simply can't be beat.  Every time I get a new one, I wonder if it can be as good as some of the others I own, and I consistently find that, yes, they can be every bit as good, if not better.

Like many of the Ravensburger games, this one may seem a bit overwhelming at first blush.  Though I didn't think the learning curve on it was too steep, it does take some thought to figure it out.  However, once you understand how it works, it's easy to remember the rules--and that's when the real fun begins.

The basic objective of Seeland is to gain the most points by building and completing farms.  By placing your windmills in choice spots and carefully surrounding them with crops with high points values, you can quickly pull ahead of your opponents.  However, you can also employ a lot of other strategies in an attempt to lessen the number of points your opponents can gain: you can try to prevent them from being able to move to stalls to purchase choice windmill plans or bags of seeds, you can surround their farms with zero and low value tiles, and you can try to arrange it so their farms offer monoculture, which results in an overall value of zero for that farm.

These strategic aspects are exactly why I love Ravensburger games.  Though we do enjoy some simple board games, we continuously go back to the games that demand more devious thinking in order to secure victory.  Though these games are simple enough to play once you get the hang of them, they require a lot of planning, analyzing, and critical thought in order to win, particularly if you're playing against subtle strategists.  Not only do my husband and I enjoy this game, my eight-year-old daughter loves it as well and she is extremely good at it.  So good at it, in fact, that she has beaten me by about one hundred points on more than one occasion.  I really like that she is so engaged with this game, that she's doing so much analysis of the board and plotting ahead that she consistently surprises me.  This makes the game very challenging, but also very rewarding.

As with all of our other Ravensburger games, the construction on this one is impressive.  The game board is made of thick, sturdy cardboard and is double-sided to allow for more varied gameplay.  There are also two sets of rules, one basic and one that includes some additional twists to make the gameplay more challenging.  The coins and tiles are made of the same high-quality, sturdy cardboard as the game board, and the markers are all made of wood.  We own a lot of board games, and I consistently find that the Ravensburger games have the highest quality construction.  These are games that are created not only with an eye toward fun and engaging gameplay, but also overall quality, and it shows.","Fun, intricate strategy game",False,3.0
B006ROJIQU,5.0,"I have to admit that I have a very soft spot for games and an even softer spot for foreign games. In the game, you play a Dutch merchant who uses windmills to create crops, like tulips, to then sell and get points to move forward. Winner, of course, gets the most points. The basic game is pretty quick, but the rules go on to make it more difficult, so the game grows with your skill level. I will admit though that it takes a good bit of time to figure out the rules and some rules had to just be decided upon.",Fun game abouth the Dutch,False,
B006ROJIQU,4.0,"Seeland combines attractive components with straightforward gameplay and a few optional rules that give it a very wide appeal. The basic game has a major element of luck while still offering interesting decisions to players, making it an excellent introduction to Eurogames. The ""Tactical"" game reduces the luck factor significantly without increasing complexity at all. Tack on the two simple optional rules (which add a touch of risk-taking into the mix) and there's a decent amount of thinking involved.

For experienced gamers, I'll say this: Seeland is a cross between Carcassonne and Samurai (the Knizia game), with a rondel mechanism for tile selection. For those to whom that last sentence seemed to be in a foreign language, the game involves placing windmills on the board and surrounding them with crops, scoring points when a windmill is completely surrounded. A randomly drawn selection of tiles is available, but there are some decisions to make regarding which tile to snag -- it's not always obvious. The variant rules let you essentially take gambles for extra points when scoring windmills.

One of the nice things about the game is that while you can simply play to maximize your own score, there are also a number of opportunities to mess with the other players. Subtleties show up with repeated play -- you might not think of it at first, but those '0' value mill tiles make great blockers when opponents are working on high-scoring mills of their own. And when selecting a tile from the rondel, it's a good idea to consider the position you leave the rondel in for the next player. I've been playing with my family (thumbs up from the Mrs. and my 7-year-old, who is a pretty serious board gamer for his age), and I plan to bring it to game night with my hardcore gamer friends as well. We can always use another 1-hour game that offers interesting decision-making without a huge amount of effort.

There are a few spots in the rules that aren't 100% clear at first glance, especially regarding setup. However, I've played a few times now and have not encountered any questions that weren't answered by a closer look at the rules. Novice players might find it a little tricky, but I don't anticipate that experienced gamers will have any trouble with this.

I do have one pet peeve: The spaces on the board are hexagons (commonly referred to as ""hexes"" in most games), but the rules refer to them as ""squares."" Really, Ravensburger?

Bottom line: Seeland isn't going to set the world on fire, but it is an excellent crossover game. It's perfect for those of us who enjoy lightweight games with our kids as well as more serious hobby games.",A nice gateway game that also works for serious gamers,False,
B006ROJIQU,4.0,"This game is a lot of fun.  It's similar to Carcassonne in that you select a tile on your turn and place it on the field, with the hopes of building up a areas that are worth points when completed.  In Carcassonne, you build cities and roads, and in Seeland you build mills and crops.  In both games, your opponents can use some of the tiles you've placed for their own advantage.

A nice feature of this game is that there are three sets of rules: basic, advanced, and tactical.  The advanced rules add depth to the gameplay that forces you to think more about which tile to choose and where to place it.  The tactical rules remove most of the luck from the game, making it almost completely strategy-based.

I also like the way the game is laid out.  It just *looks* really nice.  Some of the gameplay seems a bit odd at first, but when you get used to them, they add a certain style to the game.  For example, moving the guilders around the marketplace.

Unfortunately, the rules and construction of the game have flaws that make playing the game more time consuming and complicated without any benefit in gameplay.  I took away one star because of these flaws.

1. The mill and landscape tiles have different images on each side of the tile, but there's no need for that.  One side of the tile is shown when the tile is in the marketplace, and the other side is shown when it's in the field.  The tiles could have the same image on both sides.  This is further complicated because the game rules say to put the tiles ""face up"" or ""face down"", but it's hard to know what they mean.

2. When it's time to clean up the game, you cannot tell the difference between the island tiles and the landscape tiles until you flip them over.  That means that you need to flip over every tile before you can put any of them away.  I rectified this by putting a small dot on the landscape side of the island tiles.

3. The mill and landscape tiles are supposed to be shuffled and stacked, but that's very time consuming, especially since the tiles are two-sided.  Properly shuffling a stack of tiles is not easy.  I recommend putting all of the tiles in a cloth bag, shaking it, and then gathering them into a stack in your hand, but it's still a chore.

Finally, in my opinion, the documentation could be clearer overall.  For example, the setup instructions say to put the player's merchants on the last guilder of the guilder row, but it's not at all clear which one is the ""last"" guilder, until you look at a picture of the game board and see where they are.  The gameplay is simple once you understand it, but I still had questions even after playing the game once.",A great Carcassonne-like game,False,
B006ROJIQU,5.0,"The kids (ages 5 & 8) and I play Carcassonne and other ""Eurogames"" on a regular basis and were excited to receive a new board game in the ""resource management"" style of play.  We've played with players age 5 to 57 and all of them enjoy the game.  After 6 plays this has become a regularly requested game by the kids.  To date we've only played the ""simple"" version but both kids have been asking to add the more ""advanced"" gameplay options.

The gameboard is a set of 6 interlocking pieces that are very sturdy and creates a quite large game play area.  It is dual sided to allow for 2 methods of gameplay.  I like the non-folding aspect of the board as many US game makers have resorted to split folding methods and cheap board that tears and/or breaks seemingly after only a few sessions.  All the game pieces are dual sided on sturdy board with attractive graphics.  The player markers are all sturdy wooden pieces. Small ""zip lock"" type bags are included for storage/organization of the pieces.  Like many Eurogames the box is a bit large for what's inside but it it's also more sturdy than American counterparts.  Basically the quality of materials is that of US games of the 60s or earlier.

Gameplay is fairly simple and has a interesting way to ""pay"" for your newly acquired resource.  It took a couple of reads of the instructions along with a set up game board to fully understand the mechanics but that's not unusual for Eurogames as they tend to be a bit more complex than the typical US ""roll the dice and move"" game.  Several other reviewers have indicated the instructions are not as clear as they could be.  We didn't experience that issue.  If you read carefully and follow the mechanics using either the examples (though a couple are confusing at first read) or a game board you can easily determine the play mechanics.

Gameplay is simple:  You obtain either a ""Mill"" or ""Seed"" from the market, place it on the board, score (if applicable based on your play), replenish resources in the market, and pass play to the next person.  A game with 4 players can be completed in roughly an hour, including setup and teardown.  Using the side of the board with ""islands"" produces a game with more ""luck"" or ""chance"" in the game play than using the flip side with static elements.  Even so, there seems to be less ""luck"" involved than in many other Eurogames we've played.  This is partly due to how resources are obtained as there are choices from up to 5 different resources depending on player placement in the ""market"".  To achieve high scores you must think and plan.  It's great for teaching critical thinking skills to kids without them realizing they are learning.

The biggest problem we've had so far is the ease at which the board pieces can be ""bumped"" and moved by accident.  It *is* a large board to reach across and can be easy for a sleeve, arm, etc. to accidentally brush against board pieces and move them.

The only other complaint has to do with picking up the pieces for storage or to reset for another game.  The ""island"" pieces are only identified on the ""back"" which means you either need to methodically slide the pieces aside to use the board base to locate these or turn all the pieces over and sort pieces based on the backs.  Had the islands had a small mark on the ""front"" of the piece (like Carcassonne expansions) sorting would have been a bit easier.

Neither of these issues are deal breakers.

If you like Eurogames or are looking for a ""gateway"" game into this gaming genre I highly recommend Seeland.",Nice entry level Eurogame,False,2.0
B006ROJIQU,4.0,"I recommend adding this game to your game locker if you enjoy resource and tile placement games that are heavy on strategy.  My gaming group's experience did not match some of the other reviewers' experiences, and that is OK.  Hopefully the range of write-ups will better inform you about a decision.

It is an interesting game and a great alternative to ""Settlers of Cataan"" if you love that game and are looking for something to do on an off night.

This game is best if played in a group that has several players of about the same ability level.  Seeland tends to exacerbate differences in skill levels, because there is very little chance involved.  (If you still rue the day that your winning strategy turned to dust in '87 because you drew the wrong tile then you will love this game.)

The mechanics took a couple of rounds to figure out, but, once my gaming group got into it, turns flowed naturally and reasonably quickly.

The objective of the game is to score points based on ""harvesting"" the tiles around your mills.

Each turn takes place in three parts, acquire tiles, place tiles, and score.

The game pieces are very durable, and the assembly of the components is easy.

Here is the Dr. Games evaluation:

GO/NO GO criterion

* Complexity: Seeland scores well on this one. The game plays at several levels of complexity. In the base version, the players only worry about mills and crops.  In the more complex version, the players also have the additional complication of worrying about leveling the playing field with the governors.  Additionally, you can have random ""found"" crops (using the random isle tiles) or you can use the preset side of the board. This game is probably about right for the 13+ year old range.  The youngsters might have a hard time visualizing three to four turns out, and that is almost a necessity.

There is a fair amount of subtleness to the strategy.  You can play aggressively, or you can play defensively.  You have as many opportunities to harm other players as you do to forward your own position.

* Balanced: This is the weak point for Seeland.  Anyone can win or lose, but the gaming mavens will generally crush opponents.  In my playtest sessions, the players that were good at Settlers and other Eurogames tended to ""leave the rest of the casual players in the dust.""  There are generally around four to six scoring moves per player in the game.  So, it is quite unforgiving of a tactical error.

* Chance: Seeland scores low on this scale.  Thee is very little chance in the game, and it showed in the scores of the playtest group.  If you like Go or Chess better than Poker then you will probably enjoy this game.  I would have liked to seen more chance in the game.

* Clarity: Seeland gets neutral marks for this.  The written rules are a bit confusing and have some gaps, but the mechanics are actually fairly straight forward.  Within two turns, everyone in my playtest group knew how to play.  One of the key rules, picking up your mill after scoring was only apparent if you read the text below one of the photos in the game.  (Another reviewer pointed this out, thank you, and, while it was true that the concept was pointed out there, it was not obvious to my fairly savvy gaming group, most of whom play Eurogames. I suspect many groups would find the rules booklet a bit of a challenge.)

* Reasonable Time: Seeland gets an excellent mark here.  An entire game can be played in 45 minutes or less.

BONUS criterion

* Social: Seeland is not a very social game.  It is a strategy game, and players tend to focus on future moves, limiting conversation.  Additionally, the mechanic of crushing your adversaries' carefully laid plans rather than advancing your own interests does not lead to gushing, happy chatter.

* Unique/interesting Mechanic: The limitation on how far you can skip ahead to choose tiles based on how past players have chosen is interesting.

* Inform: While ostensibly based on Holland in the eighteenth century, it is really just a tile placing game.  I did find out what rapeseed is though.

* Rewards Throughout: There are only four scoring moves per player in the game.  It more resembles Go than Monopoly when it comes to rewards.  Also, once you head down a bad path, it is almost impossible to recover.

If you and your friends love ""Settlers of Cataan,"" this is a good game to pick up as a change of pace.

The soft is really too soft to hear well (the speaker lays against the seat when hanging from the headrest for a rear facing baby) so we have kept it on the loud setting which isn't so loud that it is distracting to the driver. It has four modes: learning, music and lights together, music alone and lights alone. The learning and music and lights mode are the ones we use most. The others don't really interest my daughter - she likes the lights and music together because the lights follow the tune of the song playing. The learning mode is pretty cool because it does include colors and shapes and adds in Spanish and French words for those as well. It will say the word in English first, then Spanish, then French then play a little song, then do another color or shape so that the child can connect that the word was all the same for one thing. A very smart feature in my opinion.

Why 4 stars then? There are a few tiny hiccups that keeps this from being perfect, two in particular: 1) switching modes is a little challenging because of the way the button moves, it can be hard to get it to the right mode because there isn't much space between each little tic as you move the button - this is only an issue if you're in a hurry and don't want it on learning mode (the first tic) but it can be a pain when you don't get it on the right one the first time; 2) you really can't see your baby in the mirror while driving. So if you're buying it for that purpose, it is not likely to work for you and I'd pick another mirror. I chose this for entertaining my daughter and it works like a charm in that respect. Now instead of crying when I put her in the car seat she leans forward to touch the mirror and gets excited about me turning it on. My daughter would give this toy 5 stars, and if that button wasn't an issue, I would too.

All in all, I'm glad I chose this mirror over the Chicco. The learning mode is fun and the music isn't annoying and has good sound quality. Also, it is similar to the Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes music so my daughter recognized the tunes playing. It works really well and batteries were easy to install. It was also easy to install into the car.",Almost perfect travel mirror,True,8.0

This is the best bath toy and the only one you need, unless you want to add in a few small dolls/action figures.  My 3.5 year old daughter LOVES it and builds castles and boats and never tires of this.  I have to admit that I love playing with them too when I soak, although I like using them more to make mosaic patterns.  They stick together when wet, so it's really fun to build things and the frustration-factor is very low.

I've actually come back to buy another set so we can build taller/more complex patterns.  There are plenty in one set, but it's so much fun that 2 is even better.

I couldn't be more enthusiastic in recommending these blocks.

The only caveat is that your kid needs to be past the mouthing/biting/chewing stage.  These will take bite marks very easily.  My 3.5 year old is 99% past that stage, but she still put a couple of bites into these.  So I wouldn't recommend them for children who put toys in their mouths.  But other than that, these blocks are amazing.  You won't realize how cool they are until you see for yourself how they naturally stick together when wet - because that makes them super functional and fun to play with.

B00ATW9TYW,5.0,"This is my daughter's second cooperative game from Peacable Kingdom.  I am a huge fan of this line of games because they do not have a winner and loser.  These games are about teamwork.  Players work together and win the game together.  This is huge at my daughter's age because we all have experienced the trauma that can come with hurt feelings associated with traditional competitive games.  The best part about Stack Up is that it has four variations discussed in the directions, geared toward ages 2-5. The first level is very basic, for two year olds.  I appreciate this because my son is 1, and he gets frustrated when he is unable to participate in his older sister's activities.  The game board itself is reversible, so for this level, the back side is used.  The game board is divided into four color groups, which correspond with the four colors of the blocks that come with the game.  There are twelve blocks in total, 3 of each color, and your two year old can simply practice sorting them by color category, an important skill for this age, and allowing them to feel like they are `playing' the game.
For ages 3-5, there are 3 levels of play, which are all variations on the same game.  The `easy' level, designed for age 3, has each player spin the wheel, and as they move across the game board they continue to add blocks to their tower.  Essentially, players are all on the same team, playing against the `Stack Smasher', a cardboard stand-up figure in the shape of a hand.  If the smasher makes it across the game board first, he gets to smash the tower.  If the tower accidentally topples at any point, the Smasher wins the game as well.  If a player drops one block, the Stack Smasher advances one space.  My daughter thought it was hilarious when the Stack Smasher got to knock over our tower!",Great for Preschoolers,False,
B00ATW9TYW,5.0,"We love Peacable Kingdom!! We have acquired quite the collection! When Stack Up came out, I had to get it for my son for Easter. I am so glad that we did! The cardboard pieces in this game are much thicker and sturdier than the ones in the other games. I was thankful for that upgrade (this one is also more expensive though).
My son has autism, and this game is PERFECT for teaching him that there is more than one way to do something. He laughs so loud when we have to do something silly while stacking...like standing on one foot or counting backwards from 10.
I would call this a skills builder game, not necessarily an educational one. It does have colors...but there is no color matching that goes on or anything. Not saying it HAS to be educational...we love it just the same! Just wanted to throw that in there in case someone was looking specifically for that. It does build needed skills as well as coordination though.

B00BW0RE2Y,4.0,"NOTE TO COLLECTORS BELOW.

I like Funko products and have really enjoyed collecting many of their DC licensed novelties. I was never really a fan of bobble heads...I mean Wacky Wobblers, but I am a Batman fan and this series of Wobblers based on the 1966 TV show was a must-add to my collection. I have all of them now: Batman, Catwoman, Joker and Robin. They are pure fun and a great way to pay homage to the series as well as the actors who brought these characters to life in such an iconic way that the stylization of the show is now a part of the great American pop-culture tapestry.

If you are looking for 100% campy Bat-memorabilia - add these Wobblers to your collection as I have. I have one major mention for ALL COLLECTORS: if you are like me and most of your collectables remain in-tact and in their packaging, you may want to consider purchasing these items from another source (like a collectables dealer). You may pay a few dollars more but it will be worth it in order to ensure you are getting collector grade packaging and product. All four of my Wobblers shipped quickly and the outside Amazon boxes were in impeccable shape, but they each arrived with different imperfections to the actual product packaging: damaged corners, bent or creased ""windows"", etc. The Robin Wobbler was in the worst shape and the damage was almost all to the front of the box - the upper part of the box is torn and the lower part is scraped - the name ""Robin"" is partially scraped off. I will most likely re-order from a dedicated dealer and my Amazon set will shed their packaging for display. So COLLECTORS TAKE NOTE: if you really need pristine packaging - buy from a trusted collectables dealer. If you want to display and play with these sans packaging - Amazon Prime will do and at a great price too.","Holy Heads A-Bobbin, Robin! But wait....",True,

She has been into space and everything space related since our trip to the Kennedy Space Center last year, so this was a great way for her to continue that interest with some role playing among her toys. At the end of the day, it is a Barbie, so it's not my favorite doll in its preference for fashion over functionality (which would not be the case in normal space suits), but it still conveys the purpose and meaning well enough, so I can look past that. The Barbie doll itself is actually a nicer one, with fully jointed knees. The elbows, though, are fixed, unfortunately.

Although we love the doll, there are some slight dislikes. For example her hair is long. If we are putting on the helmet the hair gets in the way. It would have been nice if the hair came in  a tight bun. Also the helmet and bag does not always stay closed. Made of cheep plastic.

B00DEHRNUG,4.0,"It took a while for me to get use to the face on this statue. In my opinion, Kotobukiya always has a sligh ""Anime"" look to the faces of their statues. I'm still not real sure about this one. Seems like Superman should be an ""All American"" Icon. But, I also understand that, to attract a younger audience, The characters must evolve in todays world. After all, I want the characters to live on. Overall this is a nice sculpt and great paint. It fits nicely with the Batman of the same size. If you like Superman, Buy it!",It took a while.,True,5
B00DEHRNUG,5.0,"First of all, when I received this figure----the bottom of my mouth literally hit the floor folks!  This is truly what a Superman statue should look like.  Developed and produced by Kotobukiya the very stance and image of this Superman statue ranks 100 points on my ' You gotta have it ' scale.  I have the Suoerman - AFX52 version and the recent Man of Steel statue by DC and they BOTH do no come any closer to a vibrant image and realistic dogma of this very figure.  I have never seen such a well-conceptualized and designed figure; which truly conveys what the Man of Steel should be represented to be.  The form is massive that it expresses pure power.  The body proportions are equal to the physique of Superman.  The stance reflects determination and focus to what's on his mind, that is to save the earth.  The colors are so true to form and the very effect of his red, blue and yellow costume.  The red cape of this figure, seems to have its own expressive-nature in its self.  Red and flowing with glory and have well the cape arguments his posture is very powerful.  Every detail was thought out in how to present what a Superman statue or figure should look.  The skin-tones are realistic, to include some touches of red , orange and black that gives his total facial expression as not being to harsh or angry.  His signature ' S ' on his chest is the most important aspect of this overall design.  It is traditional and yet simple.  Anyone who has ever heard of Superman, first looks at the emblem for a level of authenticity.  Also being displayed on the back, of his cape is another touch of uniqueness.  The emblem on his chest has  a relief quality; which I believe further adds beauty to this statue.  The base which comes with this figure is almost in a class by itself.  The ' S ' symbol  on the base, had varying degrees of thickness and reliefs.  It is just as important as the figure itself, but when you place the Superman on its decorative base it simply increases its value and yet it's very expressive-nature to the viewer.  Folks!  Purchase this truly one if a kind statue, before the value I increases; which may be very soon.",The Light of HOPE,True,7

B00DPGV4FQ,1.0,"Oh wow, where do I begin? My son, a veteran of multiple RC helicopters, including several Air Hogs products, couldn't wait to try this out with his father's help. After waiting impatiently for this slightly-larger than softball-sized sphere to be fully charged, they tried it out and ... Nothing. They could get it to buzz and spin and fall over, but not hover. OK, mom to the rescue after taking the radical step of reading the directions. I could get it hover slightly (maybe 1/4"" off the ground), but that was all. Maybe it needed to be charged even longer?

OK, so four-hour charge and we try it again. So, now it will fly, sort of, but it more frequently spins out of control and crash lands. We both got hit multiple times--you have to hold it in your hand to start--and this puppy packs a wallop, plus the blades keep spinning the whole time; they hurt, too. On one of those occasions my husband tried to grab it to keep it from hitting the dog and it actually tore off a piece of his fingernail, leaving a blood blister under the remaining nail bed. (This is no joke, he might lose the nail. It's black and looks awful.) And since it only worked for, I'd guess, about 10 minutes, that was a lot of injuring in a short time.

So, to sum up. This thing barely works. And, when it KIND OF does, it's totally uncontrollable. We never even handed it over to our kiddo. This was all with adults at the control and after fully reading all the directions. We never got it to perform as advertised and succeeded only in getting very frustrated, and slightly injured.

B00DPGV4FQ,3.0,"Air Hogs RC AtmoSphere - Red

I received this toy yesterday and decided it had to be a TGIF event at the place where I work.  It just cried out to be tried by a roomful of engineers, and we had a lot of fun with it.  It took one of our guys 15 minutes to get into the package and load up the batteries in the charger. There was clearly a little bit of charge on the battery internal to the AtmoSphere itself and we were able to get it to hover over our hands, move it around the room, and hand it back and forth before the battery finally died.  We waited the required 15 minutes before plugging it into the charger, and waited anxiously for the battery to charge up again. On the second round, we were much better at controlling it, and one of the engineers learned not to stick his finger into the spinning blade. It seemed that most of us had to learn that particular lesson at one time or another.  The third play session, we ventured into the factory area of our business and it almost reached the 12-foot ceiling before coming back down to a surface hover.  All of my coworkers enjoyed the AtmoSphere, and it has been thoroughly tested by adults, and it generated a lot of laughter on a very quiet Friday afternoon.

I question whether or not this is a good toy for children, however. Although the packaging says 8 + for the recommended age, I think this is more of an adult toy - a curiosity to play with and for the more mechanically inclined to study and learn from. We chased it around a good bit, and grabbing it to put it away is tricky unless it has run down completely.  It doesn't damage your fingers if they get hit, but it does sting a bit and I am pretty sure it messes up the balance on the blade causing it to move a lot more laterally than it should. It is pretty delicate, and I am pretty sure can be easily broken.  Each battery charge lasts about 10 minutes or so before the sphere has to return to the charger for a rest and recharge. I think the long waits between short activity periods would lessen its appeal.

It is a nice little novelty, and fun to experiment with, but seems to be rather limited in application for imaginative or shared play. I am not sure it would be played with more than once or twice.

This thing barely gets off the ground and the only control is your hand, although there is a stop button on the base but it doesn't always work. Speaking of hand, that is all the bigger it is. I had the impression when I ordered it that it was maybe the size of a basketball, my fault for that.

It is lousy at hovering.  It always leans one direction, and will always just fall off your hand that direction.  If you try to catch it (even with your palm), you will get buzzed by the spinning blades inside, the little grille does nothing at all.  My 8-year-old son doesn't want anything to do with it anymore after getting buzzed a few times.

If you've seen videos of these things in action, they probably had to open two dozen of these pieces of junk before they found one that hovered straight and had everything work.

Nope. Catching it in your hand means your hands get stung. As an adult, not a big deal. As a kid, it's pretty painful.

In addition, the toy must be charged in order to work, which is fine, except for the race that the charger is battery operated (doesn't plug into the wall) and it takes about an hour to power the AtmoSphere. The charge to the toy is relatively weak and I'd say we got somewhere between 10-15 minutes of play.

When it's working and hovering over things, it is a pretty cool thing to watch, so it gets two stars for that.

Pros:
~$7.50 for 8 kids
Stickers, bookmark, and tattoos were great!  The bookmark is very high quality and the images on each of the items is really cool.

Cons:
The yo-yo is very cheap, as it's weak plastic with a long string.  Some kids may enjoy it but it's a throwaway.
Included wall hanging seems nice, but due to the shape of the package, it has bent corners (I bought 2 packs)
Frisbee is plastic at least, but a little small.

So you may be wondering with the aforementioned cons I'm choosing to give the item 4 stars.  Well, if you are having a party for younger kids (8 years old or under) more than likely they will just be excited to be getting so many things.  Also, it's really hard to beat the price of this party pack...seriously, less than a dollar per child, I can easily forgive the cheaper items.  In addition, a few parents at the party were commenting that we must've spent a lot on party favors...so you're definitely getting a lot of bang for your buck here.

B00EI9UVOE,3.0,"this radio came nicely packaged in molded foam like most electronics.

Pros:
1 - It works.
2 - it plugs into your computer allowing you to change endpoints, reverse servos, set mixes etc with included software on mini dvd.
3 - Unlimited model memory stored on your computer, as many different setups as you like, loaded with the click of your mouse,
4 - 6 channels, 4 on the sticks, 2 more controlled by your choice of a variable dial, or a off on toggle switch. ( both 2 position switches)
5 - Has adjustable dual rates.
6 - Its lightweight, this might be a con, but im gonna list it as a pro because its easy to hold it for a long time.

Cons:
1 - No instructions. zip,nadda,nothing. Had to go on utube for a instructional video to figure out what several menu options did.
2  - It plugs into your computer for programing, meaning if you don't have a computer with you, you will not be able to make adjustments to endpoints, reverse servos, mixes, or anything else. It does have trims on the outside case for the 4 stick controlled channels, but they have the least amount of adjustment I have ever seen in 30+ years of using rc toys.
3 - Even after setting the endpoints to max, for some reason, this setup does not throw ( move the servos ) as much as the radio this replaced did. Kinda very disappointed with that aspect of this set. I also had to reposition the horns on the servos, to compensate for all of the channels being what I call ""off center"", and the minimal amount of adjustment the manual trims on the radio provide.
4 - had a difficult time binding it, took 4 attempts, didn't do anything different each attempt, so that was kinda weird. note on binding here, the receiver will flash red when unbound, and solid red when bound. do not forget to remove the binding key before actual use.
5 - hard to describe this con accurately, I don't feel that I have fine control over my vehicle, it starts stops and turns when I tell it to, but it is not in anyway smooth. sorta like it jumps from 0% to 10% with no in between when you move the sticks, but after that, it seems smooth the rest of the way up from 11% to 100% movement. ( percentages used are estimated to try to describe the issue )
6  - Some operating systems require you to download a driver in order for it to recognize the transmitter is plugged in. I found the link on utube in the instructional video.

Wile this is marketed as air radio for planes and helicopters. I bought it for my rock crawler. I wanted separate independent control over both front and back steering servos. Since this is a 2gig radio, there is no harm or foul in using it for surface like there would be if it was a old crystal channel based FM or am system, fcc and all that.

I am currently using the sticks for throttle, and independent front and back steering, have set one switch to toggle the dual rate on the throttle to 20% on and 100% off , this works very well when navigating a tricky obstacle. I have also used the mixing function to make the other switch control both front and back steering with 1 stick, when turned on, So it is indeed doing what I bought it for, just not quite as good as I had hoped.

I decided to buy this low end inexpensive radio mostly because of the environment I crawl in. Mud, dirt, sand, Snow, rain, or shine we play. So I didn't really want to risk a more expensive transmitter, If the elements eventually destroy the transmitter,  ill be allot less pissed then if I had spent 150 or more. There were no reviews when I bought it, but I took a shot anyway, im for the most part happy with it, and as long as you understand the few drawbacks before purchase, you should be too.","first things first.

B00G8YAOXK,5.0,This is little moist but helps in the place of Boric Powder.,Five Stars,True,
B00G8YAOXK,2.0,"New to the game and the products in the realm of carrom. This product seems like a good option. I found it to be okay. You get a lot for the price, but you don't need a lot, so cost/volume is not really a factor. So you go to performance. How does it perform? Well, its a very fine powder and as a result is very quiet for the carroms on the surface. Other than being quiet, the product doesn't really do much for enhancing the playability of the game and to some degree even slowing the game down on an otherwise high performance board. I would recommend a different product.","It's quiet, but that's it...",True,
B00G8YAOXK,5.0,"I don't understand the negative reviews. This powder worked fine for me and I ordered it directly from amazon. It came looking exactly like the bottle in the picture.

It is very fine - you have to be careful when applying it, as some of it will float in the air and you probably don't want to inhale it.

It looks like you have to cut an opening in the bottle head, to let the powder out (or if there was another way, I missed it). A tiny opening will suffice.

It is not sticky - if you blow air, you'll blow it away and it spreads easily across the board.

I spread it so I can't see it anymore - I wonder whether those that complained about it slowing down the game did spread it evenly. Watch some carrom youtube videos to see how professional players apply it to their boards before the games.

I can't see it making a impact on the sliding properties yet, but then again, I was getting 4 rebounds from my board out of the box.

An update: I do see the difference made by this powder now. I tested a new striker and initially it slid less impressively than my old striker, but after collecting enough powder on it I started seeing an improvement in its performance and it started outperforming my old striker. I will buy this item again once my current supply will be exhausted, although I expect it to last me for years.","Carrom board powder, as described",True,

I am 40ish and grew up reading the Eastman/Laird comics, watching the cartoon, and even had the original action figures.
Not that I am nostalgic or anything, but I have some basis to compare to.

These figures are pretty cool. Obviously I kept them sealed as they are a present, but I am able to look at them to discern the quality. They look fun to play with.

They are a good size, decently articulated, and have a slew of ""stuff"" they come with so they will always have weapons in hand.

B00GO9GXUC,4.0,"With the exception of the NECA Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, these are quite possibly the BEST ninja turtles ever offered; even more so if you're a fan of their Nickelodeon cartoon.

Where do we begin?

Sculpt: These are, more or less, perfectly faithful representations of what we see on screen. The proportions are all correct, the amount of detailing on the figure is correct, and the charm that Playmates have packed into these figures comes over well. Leonardo does have one problem however: his right leg is a bit longer than his left, and this is due to the peg which keeps it in place being longer. This makes standing him a bit trickier than his brothers, and is represented in him getting a lower score, than say Donatello.

Paint: Admittedly, the one point where they could use some improvement. Their mouths and weapons should have been done, but the paint app that is there is nicely done with no bleeding or smudge.

Articulation: 11 points of articulation that includes a ball-jointed head, shoulders, and hips, swivel wrists, and both elbow and knee joints come with a full range of movement. For a figure this size? It's just about perfect.

Accessories: Leo comes with his two katana, two throwing knives, and two throwing stars.

Gimmick: All of the turtles can carry their extra gear inside their shells - a really neat little play feature!

Even if you've already bought the original Nickelodeon Ninja Turtle figures, and aren't keen on buying them again for the second time, trust me - the charm and fun factor they put into these 'Battle Shell' Turtles is enough to warrant collecting the Fab Four all over again, and they will take over being the default turtles in your Nickelodeon collection.",Just about a perfect toy... if it weren't for that leg,False,8

B00HMYUZ20,4.0,"It is surprisingly hard to find Godzilla toys that include accessories. This is a good, inexpensive set that is ideal for kids to let their imaginations run wild.

The Godzilla figure is about three inches tall and has posable arms and legs. The legs will pop off if rotated too far but they go right back in. Muto is a little shorter than Godzilla and isn't posable. The buildings will either be grey or green (I got grey ones). Simply setting up a building and having one of the monsters knock it over is fun. The bridge is the biggest part of the set and looks fairly impressive when the two halves are united. The military vehicles are very small (about an inch each, with the boat the biggest) and work well as ""cannon fodder"" for the monsters. The helicopter rotors turn and can easily be removed from the copter's body and reattached.

Overall, a good effort from Bandai and a better value than the Pack of Destruction sets. It's noteworthy to add that the Muto in this set and the Muto in the Muto Pack of Destruction are two different figures, while this set and the Godzilla Pack of Destruction use identical Godzilla figures. The destructible buildings in this set are also different from the Packs. If you bought all three sets, you would get four different buildings, one bridge, three helicopters, three jets, one boat, two identical Godzillas, and two different Mutos.","Fun playset, great for kids!",True,16

Only problem, there's only 2 buildings, i wish there were more but i will not let that stop me from giving this a 5 star review.",Don't pass this up,True,5
B00HMYUZ20,4.0,"I'll start off by saying that I'm not a ""huge"" fan of the new Godzilla suite
design, but I am open enough to say that it might grow on me once I've seen the
movie, etc.  I won't be buying all the first-wave merchandise, but as I loved Bandai
America's old Pack of Destruction and Crumble Zone sets, this particular set is also
of interest to me. Indeed, as opposed to the actual Godzilla figure, the main draw
here for me is the buildings and the bridge (I've always thought it made sense to
include some buildings with kaiju toys; hopefully this will catch on).  The boat
and helicopters are alright.

So, I picked up ""Destruction City"" right away. I should mention the colors:  The
general color scheme of the ""Destruction City"" buildings will be green, though as
fans are noticing, the original run was white/grey (like in Amazon's picture).
Also, if you look at pictures for the individually sold ""Pack of Destruction"" sets,
they are often shown with red buildings - this was because they were also part of
the limited initial run. That's why different retailers will show pics with different
colored buildings).  Bandai has said that they initially went with white/grey but
changed their minds in order to add some ""variety"" (seems odd in the sense that Bandai
America hasn't shown much ""variety"" in other regards, but that's a side note.
Personally, I'm fine with any and all the colors so far, esp. since these buildings
are a no-brainer (Bandai should just sell multi-colored packs of buildings seperately
so you can have as many and in whatever color you want, right? I'd buy them).

The last thing I can really think to mention is about overall quality; most of the
line of 2014 GZ product is 'plastic,' versus the standard use of vinyl [Good news:
Bandai has also stated that there will be additional standard (i.e. ""vinyl"") releases
of GZ 2014 figures in the future).  I doubt this will be an issue for the majority
of those looking forward to either the movie or the toys, but some collectors will
feel the toys are a tad on the 'cheap' side (thinner material for instance).  Those
buying these for really young kids, however, are not likely to get any complaints
on that score.  So, to each his or her own - I just hope the movie is fun, and will
certainly have some fun with the Destruction City/Pack of Desttruction playsets :)",Pretty cool.,False,8

B00ITOAYZK,4.0,"PROS:
 authentic character toy, which my 4-year-old loves
 Skye figurine has movable legs and head (though because of Skye's harness it's a bit hard to straighten out the front legs all the way)
 wings on side fold out
 has wheels so it can roll across the floor
 high-quality (my 18-month-old has dropped this quite a few times without any breaks or chips  I was worried about the top propeller part, but so far everything is holding up great)

CONS:
 Skye figurine is very top-heavy (big head) so it falls out of the vehicle all the time during play  not a huge deal for my 4-year-old Paw Patrol fan, but it would be nice if the figurine was weighted at the bottom or had magnetic feet to stay in the vehicle","Nice, authentic toy, though figurine is top-heavy, so it falls out of the vehicle all the time",True,4.0

The helicopter is pretty basic - which I actually really prefer. No sounds,  not super heavy. It does need the doors to open though. That's a bummer. It rolls easily. Skye is cute, but her face is slightly pink tinted, which is different, apparently, from the other skyes we own and from the cartoon. She's still cute, but kids notice these things.  Her legs and neck move, but she's not an action pack, that was a big oversight on my part! This would otherwise be a 4-5 star toy if it weren't for Skye being so top heavy that she can't stand on her own or stay in the helicopter! If i could find my packaging I would probably return it to avoid the frustration this causes toddlers.

B00ITOAYZK,4.0,"Sky! She is my daughters favorite Paw Patrol character. So after her brother got the Paw Patroller for his birthday (like a car carrier specifically for the paw patrol vehicles) he spent his birthday money on two more paw patrol characters I decided to treat my daughter to Sky.

The package is EASY TO OPEN, no scissors needed, I loved that it was easy to open, just held together with tape and a couple of plastic screws that you unscrew with your fingers. Any person who is having to open toys at birthdays and Christmas will appreciate that!

The toy its self see, seems ok, Maybe a little plasticy, but most toys are these days, although it seems like it will hold up well to lots of play. Sky is a little top heavy and does not stand well with out falling over, which is a little frustrating. The helicopter has wings that fold up and fold back down, which my daughter loves, and the rotors on top spin. As advertised this does fit in the paw patroller.

B00ITOAYZK,4.0,"My three-year-old twins love Paw Patrol so they were delighted to find several Paw Patrol toys under the tree for Christmas this year! Of course, my daughter loves Skye so she was anxious to play with her right away. Before I describe this toy, let me just say that Skye is extremely hard to find. I looked in a number of local stores and they had most of the other pups and their vehicles like this one but I never once saw Skye. The only place I found her was on here and I was delighted to see that at the time, the price was also relatively similar to how much these cost in the stores, just under $13. Skye, along with the rest of the pups, became very hard to find the closer it got to Christmas so if the show is still really popular in future years, I would recommend buying them early if you can.

This particular helicopter works with the Paw Patroller, the huge bus that the Paw Patrol uses in the newer episodes to travel around. We have the Paw Patroller along with all of the compatible vehicles which my kids love as well. The helicopter is approximately 7 inches long, 4 inches tall, and 3 inches wide. The wheels on the bottom of the helicopter roll, the propeller spins, and the wings extend. I have found that my daughter has trouble extending the wings so young children may need some help with this. The helicopter seems to be well-made of heavy-duty plastic that has held up really well so far with my toddlers. They don't necessarily throw this toy but it has gotten dropped a few times and everything is intact.

My biggest complaint is the Skye figurine, which seems to be common among reviewers. Skye is rather top-heavy and her head is not proportional to the rest of her body. Because of this, she often falls out of the helicopter and my daughter gets frustrated when she can't get her to stand up. Skye's legs move back and forth and if you position her legs just right, she will stand up but this is definitely frustrating for my daughter. Her head also swivels from side to side. Nonetheless, she's still one of her favorite toys and likes to hold her while watching the show.

Overall, my daughter and I like this toy, despite the Skye figurine being top-heavy. The nice thing is if you are able to get all of these vehicles and pups, you also get a whole set of the pups without having to buy them separately! If you have a child who is a fan of the show and loves Skye, I'd definitely recommend purchasing this toy. Because Skye is so popular, I would highly suggest buying her earlier as opposed to later during the holiday season if you can. I see my kids playing with these toys for a long time!",My Daughter Loves Skye but She is Extremely Hard to Find!,True,10.0
B00ITOAYZK,5.0,Nice toy....I'm sure my grand daughter will be pleased with this Birthday gift....,Nice toy...,False,
B00ITOAYZK,3.0,"Skye is my daughter's favorite, and I've been disappointed that this seems to be the most poorly made of the Paw Patrol characters. Skye is so top heavy that she literally cannot stand up in the helicopter if you move it a centimeter. I've tried moving her legs to different positions, turning her head to the side, etc, and nothing will keep her standing up if you so much as breathe on her. It's made it a bit difficult for play, as Skye often ends up piloting her helicopter upside down, as that's her heaviest part and the only way to keep her in the copter while my daughter flies it around the room. I can get her to stand up on the stationary Lookout Tower, as long as no one touches the tower or any other thing in it. That being said, if your child is a really big Skye fan, I doubt that would keep you from purchasing her.","Skye is my daughter's favorite, and I've been disappointed that this seems to ...",True,

He was disappointed there was no hook on the bottom of the helicopter (by far what he thinks is the coolest part of Skye's vehicle). The Skye figurine also doesn't stand up very well because her head is so proportionally large. She also falls out of the helicopter very easily.

B00ITOAYZK,4.0,"My kids love this Skye and helicopter set, but she is a bit top heavy.

It's impossible to keep her steady in the helicopter, and because the sides of the cockpit are so low, she pretty much falls out if you breath on the thing.  We have the Skye with the jetpack wings, and she stays in the helicopter a bit better.  The helicopter itself doesn't do much, but my daughter loves it - you just have to figure out how keep her from falling out.

The head is too big so it is top heavy and the part of the vehicle that you put it in is too shallow.

B00ITOAYZK,5.0,"Ok first, this is a toy review.  I am tired of seeing bad reviews for pricing or availability issues- that has nothing to so with the toy itself.  That should be done under seller review, product reviews are for the actual toy!  (I won't even get into the reviews about people buying a racer thinking it was a vehicle and giving the toy a bad review for their mistake..).

As for pricing, I was able to purchase two Skyes for the regular $12.99 price.  If you want a cheaper price you have to check back often, amazon's prices fluctuate based on day or time.  I got on, refreshed the page, the price dropped from $38 something to $12.99. I added two to my cart, checked out, and looked again and in that one minute it was back up to $34.99.  If you don't have time or need her now, convience comes at a price.

As for the toy...her paint job is just as nice as the other pup vehicles.  Her pink and grey are a bit darker that I expected but still great.  Her wings on her body are in (and stay in- she is not an action pup). Her rotors will spin and her helicopter wings pop up.  She has wheels to drive when not flying.

Just like the other non transforming vehicles, the better your child's imagination the more they will enjoy these toys.

I have three boy toddlers that play with the paw patrol toys often.  They have been dropped, smashed and crashed- and all have held up.  Skye will be brought by Santa so I cannot attest for her durability yet, I'm guessing they will have to be a tad more careful since she has the rotors.

Now we will just wait and see what spinmaster does with Everest.","Product review of skye, not her price",True,5.0

B00J49ASTQ,3.0,"My six year old LOVES this Zombie costume, but I personally am a little disappointed in two things. 1. They branded the costume with ""MORPHSUITS"" in white across the low back/butt region (see picture) -- WHY would you do that on a costume?? Or if you are going to do it, at least use a color that blends with the costume.  and 2. They claim you can see and drink through the costume. When outside in daylight, yes my kid can sort of see through it, but when he is in the house in the evenings running around it is much harder for him to see - not sure how this will work on Halloween night.  And last but not least, a comment on the size... Again, my kid is 6, relatively normal height for a 6 year old - I ordered the small and it fits him great (It is skin tight on his skinny frame (see picture), but this is exactly what he wanted).  Other notes: the costume zips up from the butt to the neck line, then has a Velcro closure for the head portion (see pic). The velcro closure on the head portion is superb! It is strong holding, but still easy to open.  I would be giving a 4 Star review if they didn't feel the need to stick a giant logo on the back (that was just tacky in my opinion) and 5 stars if the material at the eyes was a little thinner and easier to see through","Great costume quality, but watch out for LOGO painted across the back",True,

He's a lean but muscular boy at around 54lbs, and his body fit it perfectly, if your kid is outside these measurements I'd size up! As for the quality, it's about what we expected.

B00K6OHI64,5.0,"Hershel and Rick in this series are hands down the best looking figures so far other than the Daryl Dixon motorcycle deluxe figure, Any way I know I've said this way to much if you read any of reviews on the figures but McFarlane has hit the likeness of the actors to the figures out the ball park and its amazing to watch the progression from series 1-6. So, Lets start off with the basics what you will expect once you get the figure you notice couple of accessories that this figure comes with which are two Crunches, prosthetic foot , and pistol all them are rich in detail aswell as Hershels sweaty shirt and weathered down pants. Now mine has couple of missed paint apps for the hair and beard put not major. For those who are buying this figure cause of the picture don't not rely on that because that is a prototype model ! anyway this figure was a pain in the ass to stand but the easy way to get Hershel to stand properly you can use his prosthetic foot but I took the challenging way to use the crunches and surprisingly got him to stand !!! I love this figure so much and it looks fantastic with the others, I would Highly recommend getting this and adding Hershel Greene to your Walking Dead Collection !

Do yourself a favor and invest in some big plastic pans or something similar to put this in. We camp a lot so I let the kids play with this on a covered picnic table. If you have some molds, your kids will love the fact that when they fill a mold and ""bang"" it out, the model actually stays together rather than crumbling like regular sand.

B00LNFS332,1.0,"My 3 yr. old son has sensory issues, so indoor play sand is more than just a toy for him. It's an entire sensory experience that calms & soothes him. Christmas brought him a small box of sand from Target and it was AWESOME!! Felt and looked like wet sand, but NOT messy. I let him play with it in the family room on our mid length carpet. IT DIDN'T STICK AT ALL!!! Fast forward a month, it's getting a little gross and we needed new sand, but I couldn't remember the name. So I bought Sand's Alive....ugh.

Yes, you get a lot of sand for the price. BUT THIS IS NOT SAND!!! It looks & feels more like dough. Even my 10 yr. old daughter who like to play in the sand with her brother was bummed. THIS SAND STICKS TO YOUR KIDS' HANDS, THE CARPET, TABLE, & EVERYTHING ELSE!!

I thought maybe it needed to dry out, but it didn't help. Today, we were at Target and they had the same sand from Christmas in the dollar aisles for $3.00 a box. My son got SOOOOO excited and started yelling ""Look, they have the RIGHT sand!""

B00LNFS332,1.0,"This stuff is WAY different from most of the kinetic sand type products. It also doesn't really act like sand in any way. If you are thinking of getting this or some of the other sand products, watch some of the review videos between the different products and maybe go to a toy store to try them out.

As an aside, we have some of the other brands. This stuff seems to 'stick' to things like carpet and clothes a lot better than to itself. So clean up is NOT a breeze. Keep that in mind. We actually had more of this stuck to our socks while trying to clean it up than to the 'sand' itself. It actually has WORSE cleanup than Playdough when landing on the carpet - which really is saying something. If you hate picking up bits of playdough frmo the carpet, go with Kinetic sand of CraZ Sand since they actually pick up bits that fall onto the floor or table with using a ball of the product. Heck even playdough can do that, 'sands alive' however cannot and just leaves a layer of itself behind.",WORST clean up ever,True,13.0

Would warn potential buyers that it is a little prone to get stuck in carpet pile if dropped, and it's fairly easy to drop a little of it.  It sticks together well with firm pressure but otherwise it is very loose.  If you don't have a kit with molds yet, consider purchasing one of those rather than the sand alone.

B00NO65GFG,2.0,"Family member bought these as an early birthday present, knowing how much I loved Star Wars. At first they were pretty cool, until they turned off out of nowhere without me touching a single button. It's obvious that these are knock offs, too, and not the good kind of knock off. They look to be cheaply made, too, by looking at the hilts. The hilts themselves do look nice, but when off the blades themselves are just these short, white, skinny cylinders encased in a plastic tube. The toys also feature two buttons. One button turns the saber on and makes the standard lightsaber sound effects, even making the clashing noise when hit/tapped off something such as the other blade or a wall. The second button makes these cartoonish samurai/ninja sword sound effects, like steel clashing with steel, which makes absolutely no sense for a sword that is supposed to be made of plasma. (No, George Lucas, Lightsabers are NOT Lasers. How do I know this? Because science.) One more cool feature they have, by the way, is the ability to combine them together to make a double sided lightsaber. This is probably the best and only great thing about these toys.

Overall a bit disappointing, but They feel good in my hands and will probably make decent back scratchers or something. I'll probably still mess around with them like the little Star Wars nerd I am.","Great for kids, not so great for older fans",False,

B00O0A5KCO,1.0,"If I can give this toy NO stars, I would!  Although the doll and clothes it comes with are adorable, it has too many issues preventing me from recommending this toy.  First for all, Elsa's feet are pointed like a ballet dancer on her tip toes making it impossible for her shoes to stay on unless you rubber band them.  Second, and most annoying of all, her fingers are splayed out, making it impossible to get her dresses with long sleeves on.  The sleeve holes are very small so her fingers can't get through.  It's difficult for an adult and frustrating for little kids.  Our Elsa spends most of her time naked.  I'm actually tempted to cut the sleeves off so we can get some use out of the dresses.  Third, her changing screen panel came off the first day of use.  It can be put back on since the hinges are not snapped, but it is now so loose that it keeps falling off.

No choking hazard which makes these toys perfect for young kids.  The motorcycle is sturdy enough to the character and not fall over.  Captain America is able to bend and sit on the motorcycle.  The drawback for me and the reason I am giving this toy a 4 star is the hand is very hard to attach to the handlebars ( I even struggled trying to do this to make my kid happy).

The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is that there was no indication in the advertisement that it has no magnetic tiles with it.

I had bought my son batman Malone bear in the pajamas and the material of his outfit is cotton and soft and huggable. I just assumed the same material would be used for Superman griffin. Im guessing that Batman in the pajamas is meant to be a cuddly bedtime bear so they used softer materials. I don't know if the regular Batman Malone is the same as Superman Griffin. I just wish he had a softer feeling outfit to make him a better cuddle companion.,Outfit feels a little rough.,True,

B00V695I5Q,1.0,"Read my review on the Starter Track and save your money...
This product has a lot of great features, which I will start with, and one major issue, GAMEPLAY, especially with expansion packs and cars. Understand that I am including expansion packs and expansion cars in my review because ANKI is the one including all the expansion possibilities in their marketing of this Starter Kit product.

Pros
- beautifully packaged
- outstanding car look and detail
- awesome car lights with varying colors
- simple track set up that is FUN fun fun!! (with a few minor tricks for risers to create multi levels)
- software is simple enough to grasp for people with experience on iPhone (first use of each expansion car required a little download update, that is fine with me)

Cons - You must be able to PLAY the game, or it is just a model kit, which is a 1 of 5 stars.
- major issues with gameplay, I repeat MAJOR. In Anki Demos on line - watch the demo with 10 if not 40 cars driving around the track flawlessly, we know that gameplay is limited to 4, with that said, lets start with a reasonable set of expectations a SIMPLE race with 2 to 4 cars... Just know that the following procedure must be repeated before each and every race, any mistake on the test laps, which I will list examples below, causes you to have to STOP and repeat all of these steps, which is too too often:
A. Each player must load the game on their phone/tablet (great) OR (not great...) back out of the failed game to return to the ""room"" that the host will select the players out of.
B. Place your car behind the start finish line on the track
C. On your phone/tablet select your car from the available cars, Host starts the race
D. Host begins race, and the cars take two laps around the track (attempt to anyway) to understand the shape/configuration of your track
E. Race may begin

So... knowing that is how EACH and EVERY race takes place whether you changed any racetrack configuration or not here we go...

-----we laid out a track with 2 cars and 4 cars, really made no difference in the errors, 50 % of the time, at least one of the cars could not drive around the track and stop at the start/finish line correctly which is required for most of the gameplay options (not time trial mode). Failures included but were not limited to:
1. inability to jump the ramp piece
2. cars getting confused during the test lap and literally turning around and going the wrong way
3. cars just plain driving themselves off the track then searching helplessly around the tile floor looking for the track
----- during gameplay if you cars leaves the track and this happens often, forget about putting it back o the track and trying to finish the race, whether by buggy software error, or someone shooting you off the track you are DONE most of the time, even when placed almost exactly where the car left the track the car is now disoriented and rarely will function properly for that player
----- use of the Launch Piece increases game failure rate - cars fail to jump the ramp successfully about 1/3 of the time when trying the test lap and during gameplay, this wonderful piece makes it very hard to get a race going
----- use of Big Bang - we had problems with the car Big Bang getting to the start/finish line properly, sometimes he would bang the other cars as it finished its warmup lap and tried to line itself up at the line. Bad news if you lets the race go on from this point because the cars are disoriented to the track, you must restart the race preparation procedures.

Ah, you are thinking user error:
----- Yes the cars were fully charged
----- Yes we had clean track piece
----- Yes we cleaned the tires with the tire cleaner

If Anki fixes these issues I would love to own the product. It simply, unequivacally DOES NOT WORK AS SHOW AT ALL!!!

A downside to it is if this is for a child, they may become disappointed in some of the days.

We ran into one problem, though. My daughter has the LEGO Friends advent calendar. On the very first day, she opened up a character to play with, and then she got to build a little sled for the character on the second day. She plays with it nonstop and loves it. However, so far, my son has gotten 2 little builds that he couldn't recognize (and he's a big Star Wars fan). One was a mini LEGO Jabba barge and the other might be a sarlacc. They're really kind of stupid, and he can't play with them yet because he hasn't gotten any characters. I know he WILL get R2D2 and a C-3PO and a stormtrooper... I just wish he'd gotten one on the first day so he didn't have to just watch his sister play with hers.

Yesterday was our first day doing it, and they are looking forward to opening a new door today too!  When you open the box, it makes a 'platform' when you fold it down, so when you open the doors, you've got a place to set (or play with) that day's Lego surprise.

B00XUZH3XO,3.0,"This was my 1st time buying vtech brand. I didn't actually intend to use this with vtech cars, I wanted to use it with vintage Fisher Price Little People cars. Although the vintage Fisher Price car I tried fit well, I'm planning to return this. The main deal-breaker was that the gas pump doesn't reach all the way to the fuel tank on my car which in my opinion drastically takes away from the realism. I thought maybe I'd just use the car that came with the set but it has NO fuel tank at all which is even worse. I also had some difficulty with the lift. It went up well but trying to push it down was difficult. It sometimes got misaligned when coming down. Also when the lift is all the way down the yellow part that spins ends up facing in a direction that makes no sense to me. There's no way for the car to ""drive on to"" the lift. The kid would have to just pick up the car & place it there which, again, takes away from the realism. When I decided to disassemble & return it I found that it is EXTREMELY difficult to take apart. I was very nervouse I might accidentally break it in the process. I had to ask my husband to strong-arm a few of the final pieces that I couldn't get out. I'm all for making toys sturdy so they don't fall apart during rough play, but this was WAY TOO difficult to dismantle. I've provided some pics. 1 is just to show you what it looks like when I first opened the box & took the parts out.

As a stand alone kit the auto repair is a fun adventure game for my three year old. There are moving parts all over, and he LOVES the wrench. He likes the hot rod that comes with the track. Stand alone it is an ok toy... As an addition to his whole set of tracks this kit becomes a legendary auto repair that to my 3 year old's imagination, servicing not only cars but also trains, planes, and helicopters!
The point that I feel should be made clear however is the angle of the off ramp, it is not a 90* angle and you may need to by yet more tracks to help it connect to your existing tracks.
Original Post: 1 Star due to extreme frustration!
I bought this for my son who LOVES the vtech cars. He already has the huge track with the trains. I didn't think anything of it when I bought this addition. I figured it would tie right into the train track. Alas, this kit DOES NOT fit into the train track. These are NOT COMPATIBLE. The angle of the Auto repair ramp is nowhere near the same as the track.
The pic makes it look like a 90* angle but it isn't. It doesn't work. My son doesn't understand that I cannot magically make it work. His disappointment of not being able to incorporate the auto repair into his existing track makes me want to melt it all down and send it back.",3 year old Loves Vtech Go Go cars.

B010R2RHME,5.0,"This is easily my favorite Lego Dimensions pack to date, and while Lego Dimensions was my oldest daughter's Christmas present, the Doctor Who level pack is definitely daddy's (it's been fun introducing her to The Doctor through Lego Dimensions).

Putting The Doctor (Capaldi's 12th Doctor) is as easy to put together as any minifigure, and that's the first step. Once you put The Doctor on the portal, it opens up the ""Adventure in Space and TIme"" level, complete with a Lego-ized Doctor Who opening and title screen (I really liked that touch). You quickly get the prompts to build the TARDIS and then K-9 through the on-screen instructions, both of which are well-realized for such small Lego models. The in-game TARDIS is well-rendered (yes, it's bigger on the inside) and fun to use. K-9 basically functions as a vehicle (complete with laser cannons and voice clips from the show). Finishing the level unlocks the TARDIS and K-9 in the rest of the game.

The 'Adventure in Space and Time' level is well-realized and full of Daleks that regenerate rather quickly, providing a bit more challenge than some of the other levels (sometimes bordering on the tedious). The time-travel mechanic is well implemented, as you'll travel back in time to do something (plant a tree, build a door, etc.) that then unlocks the way in the future version of the stage. It's a long level (longer than most of the standard ones), so be prepared for that when you start.

Overall, this is definitely my favorite addition to LEGO Dimensions so far, and I hope that The Doctor will get more Lego treatments in the future. It's also one of the most well-implemented Dimensions packs released so far (I can only hope that the Ghostbuster pack turns out as well). If you love Lego, this is great, but if you love Lego and are also a Whovian, then this is a must-have.",A must-have for Whovians and the most well-implemented Lego Dimensions Level Pack so far.,False,3

Who cares.  It's Doctor Who characters in a video game and it's the Lego Dimensions favorite,so far. We already have the Dalek and Cyberman on pre-order.",Great game sounds with these characters.,True,
B010R2RHME,5.0,"I really like this pack, and being a fan of Dr. Who probably contributes to my feelings about it, but it is good even for those who are not necessarily fans of the show.

First, for the Doctor Who fans. What's more fun than flying around Lego Worlds in a Tardis? This is one of my favorite vehicles, although admittedly it is hard to control sometimes when you are trying to use it in races (plus it is not the fastest flying vehicle). The Doctor has lots of great lines throughout and going back and forth in time time and space and visiting various areas of the Doctor Who world is fun. You also get to meet many foes of the Doctor throughout... I think I will let you see for yourself whether than spoil it by listing them... especially the one that I was most excited to see made it in the game. The Doctor also regrenerates every time he dies and cycles through the 12 doctors, plus the War Doctor. Also, being able to go into the Tardis and experience each Doctor's Tardis is pretty cool. Plus, you get to use the sonic screwdriver to do stuff... sonic screwdrivers are cool!

Now for everyone: The Level itself is the longest add-on level in the game. It will provide you with plenty of bang for your buck. It is also very well written and includes lots of great Lego puzzles and a great storyline. The Tardis is a very useful vehicle as it lets you fly all around the worlds, has stealth ability, and on the 2nd build can destroy gold Lego objects. I also like the shooting ""4 lasers beams out in all four directions"" option using the right trigger (Xbox). The Doctor has many great lines, plus he is a useful character in all worlds as he provides technology, hacking, repair, and sonar smash abilities. The K-9 is pretty useful too as it can destroy silver objects with it's second build, plus he is fun to ride and use blow up stuff. K-9 is also one of the easier to control vehicles.

If you only get one Level Pack add-on, then this is the one to get, especially if you are a Dr. Who fan!!!",Best overall Level Pack,True,4
B010R2RHME,5.0,"Extraordinarily well done, and in a form that takes Doctor Who seriously.  That itself is a really fine line, considering how thin the line was in the show (before the reboot) between serious and camp.

The level itself is a fairly intricate one, with challenging puzzles and gameplay.  This is in start contrast to a lot of other LEGO/Traveler's Tales offerings, so that itself is welcome.  The gameplay is enhanced by using original actors voices wherever possible, which includes K-9, Daleks, and of course The Doctor.

Yes, the Doctor.  As the Brigadier once said:  Splendid chap....ALL of them.

Now then, there are a couple of nits, but these are nerdy nits so never mind.  First I was surprised that the Daleks could be beaten in ordinary combat.  I kind of liked a part midway through the level where you needed K-9's laser to kill them.  It just kind of takes away from the fearsome nature of the Dalek if you can go up and kill one with two or three punches.

Oh, and IMO K-9 should NOT have been a vehicle.  He should be a character.

Those aside, I'm really quite happy and amazed by this level.  Even if you only like Doctor Who a little, you really need this level pack.  It adds a LOT to the overall game.

Simpsons, from what I could tell was mainly Homer walking through town, going to a chili eating contest, going on a hallucinated adventure . . . and that was it?  Doctor Who has an adventure of about the same length featuring the daleks, but even during that there are more moments of fun with you traveling to places in the tardis and seeing things from the show.  After you are finished with the Daleks you can walk around town and find characters from the show and help them in quests (example: Missy wants you to find some hiding Zygons).  In this mode you also regenerate into each doctor, in the correct order, if you die.  I'm really hoping to see a true Doctor Who Lego game with moments from all the TV show seasons.

Of the level packs available so far, this one easily takes the cake. I'm not even that big of a Doctor Who fan, but this pack definitely gave me my money's worth. The character is fun to play with and has some funny dialog. In addition to the 12th Doctor, you can ""regenerate"" through all 11 other Doctors, as well as the War Doctor.

The Tardis vehicle is simply fantastic. The interior is nicely detailed in its design and will correspond to whichever Doctor you're currently playing as.

The level included is probably the most lengthy level of the game, allowing you to travel through different sections of London through different periods of time to solve puzzles. It's a unique twist that lends itself well.

B0115OO03C,5.0,"Great fun and short game. This is the best verison I've seen. We all enjoy this game and the shiny tokens. It would be cool if more than 4 people could play at a time, but it makes sense since there's so few cards.",Great fun and short game,True,
B0115OO03C,5.0,"Very neat version of Love Letter. The tokens are pretty, and the art is really neatly done. I like that there are different images on the cards, that they don't all match. Overall, though, it's the regular Love Letter game. For those wondering about ages that this game can be played, we also have the Batman version of this game and my five year old daughter can play with a little bit of help. Okay, she's getting there playing it, but if we play to four or five points it gives her something we can play together, and I've found that games we can both easily enjoy are few and far between. She memorizes what the actions are to the numbers on the cards, then memorizes the pictures themselves, near as I can figure. She wanted this version because of the princess and the token ""jewels"", and seems to like it, though she's never seen Adventure Time.

For those who haven't played Love Letter, you can start with this version without a problem. The rules are fairly simple, and the rounds are pretty short. It's an easy game to learn, and a fun one to play when you don't have a lot of time or don't want to go into a lot of setup.

B0115OO03C,5.0,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this re-theme of Love Letter! If you're a fan of both Adventure Time and Love Letter, you need to get this game. The titles are different, but everything else (#s, their actions, rules, etc.) is pretty much the same. If you get this game, it's for the exquisite reimagining of your favorite Adventure Time characters in Renaissance gear . You've got PB, Lady Rainicorn, Ice King, Jake, Finn, BMO, Gunter, LSP, Marceline, Peppermint Butler, Lemongrab, and Banana Guards all looking fabulous/adorable! I'm not aware of all the re-themes of this game that are out there, but I'd say this one is a good one to get just because it goes out of its way to restyle the characters. The only other example I'm aware of is the Batman version. While I absolutely love Batman, I was a bit disappointed that they just continued using the Batman characters in their typical comic style format with them posing in their usual costumes.

Also, if you're debating whether to get the pouch or box, I'd say get the pouch if you can shell out the extra bucks/cents. I'm pretty sure the only differences are the 2 new rules that are added in this version's rulebook (or, at least, I heard that only this version has these 2 new rules), but honestly if you can find out what these rules are online, you don't need this pouch version.

The gameplay is simple and easy to pick up, and even if you had no experience with card games, this one guides you through it with helper cards and effects written in the simplest way possible.

For $10.00, we thought this was a great gift. I am surprised with all of the negative reviews- but again, we didn't see the commercial with what it is supposed to do. However, we assumed bubbles will eventually pop- and they do- but not before she has had a lot of fun with them. Gloves need to be dry when you catch the bubbles.

B012WHM66O,3.0,"*Disclosure: I was contacted by a rep for Juggle Bubbles and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it.*

If you have kids, or, remember your own childhood, bubbles are lots of fun, depending on what you get.  My personal preference leans toward Gymboree bubbles, as they stay pretty well.  Way better than mostly anything else.  Along comes Juggle Bubbles, which, in theory, are supposed to be so rigid that can bounce them from hand to hand.  If you have ever looked at what goes into bubble solution, you will know that ""good"" bubbles come from more than soap and some water.  Additions of vegetable glycerin and sugar in various proportions can change the overall solution from something makes tiny soon popped bubbles to massive floating away kinds.  Juggle Bubble doesn't list what the solution contains, but I would take a guess that they upped the sugar, which should give the bubbles a thicker skin.

The package contains two soft gloves, bubble solution, tools needed to make bubbles. Out in the yard, I put the Juggle Bubbles up against my Gymboree favs.  At first, it seemed like a tie.  Bubbles from both solutions lasted just as long.  When the gloves were introduced though, the difference became apparent.  The Gymboree bubbles could not be touched, while the Juggle Bubbles could.  At least for a while.  Working my way though the bottle, I noticed that the bubbles produced were not uniform in performance.  Sometimes where were poor and popped with the slightest touch, other times they didn't seem to ever go away.  Swirling the bubble solution in the bottle before use produced the best results over all.  Swirled, not shaken, which would foam up the solution.

One thing to note is that while it was possible to bounce the bubbles from hand to hand, and have bubbles land, one has to be GENTLE with them.  Watching the video from the Juggle Bubbles website and the commercials, it's very obvious that the record and playback speeds of the video have been tampered with.  Artificially sped up and slowed down.  This gives the appearance that the bubbles can be handled somewhat roughly and be ok.  In my experience, under the best circumstances, this is simply not true.  Gentle bouncing and touches are required at all times.  Teaching a pair of toddlers to do this didn't go every well, but the teen in the house was able to get it down.

At the end of the day, I think Juggle Bubbles are bit of bubble solution that, while interesting, are nowhere near as nifty as the maker and marketer would like you to believe.  You might consider trying to make some on your own, as there plenty of instructions online.",Pop! goes my hope,False,9.0
B012WHM66O,1.0,"My three year old spotted these in the ""As Seen on TV"" aisle of a chain pharmacy.  He begged me to buy them because, ""Mommy, they have a secret no pop bubble solution!""  I tried explaining to him that this box was filled with nothing more than regular old bubbles and disappointment.  But the promise of hours of fun bouncing bubbles between his little gloved hands was all he could think about.  I relented and bought the juggle bubbles. Disappointment ensued.",Waste of money,False,
B012WHM66O,2.0,"These bubbles looked like a lot of fun and my kids were eager to try them out.  Unfortunately they do not work very well.  We tried for a half hour and almost all the bubbles broke before we could even get them on the glove.  I think we only got one or two bubbles to actually bounce and only about twice before they landed on the ground and broke. We ended up getting out our regular bubbles after the wasted half hour of trying to use these. I think there is a really steep learning curve to using these and if you don't spend the time to figure it out, your children are going to be disappointed.

B012WHM66O,2.0,"I'm disappointed!  While we were able to create bubbles, and they did bounce off the gloves, it wasn't as much fun as we expected.  And we had to do it inside a controlled environment.

I think it's because you only deal with one bubble at a time:  One kit, one bubble blower, one pair of gloves; you dip the blower in the solution and blow a single big bubble....You get the idea.  Really, not much interaction, and only good for one player.  I love to blow bubbles with a wand and get a lot of enjoyment watching bunches of iridescent bubbles float through the air, chase 'em around, touch and pop them, or watch them float out of sight.  But this is one...bubble...at...a...time....

Plus it does not perform well in humidity.  Nor does it perform in any kind of wind.  Inside the house where we have the humidity set to 50%, we got the bubbles to last, at most, a half minute.  And we got, at most, two bounces.

And how much is this?  I don't know that it is worth it, and I would be upset if I had paid money for it.  As it is, I received a sample product for review from the distributor.  And it's only worth a two star rating.","I expected more substantial, sturdier bubbles",False,3.0
B012WHM66O,1.0,These are terrible and do not work. Either they pop once you blow them up or they pop as soon as they touch your glove or the ground. Bought as a gift for my little girl and she was so upset when she couldn't hold them.,Do not buy this,False,
B012WHM66O,4.0,"These bubbles can supply a bit of fun for a young kid, but probably won't be that entertaining for long unless they're playing with someone else and bouncing bubbles together. You may also want to have your camera ready as well to get some good photos with your child holding and handling the bubbles.

My 7 year old son was a bit too rough with them even after I told him several times he needs to be more gentle, so that could be an issue. The bubbles are by no means indestructible and they can and will pop, but you can indeed handle them gently with the gloves. The gloves need to stay dry and can be hand washed and air dried.

My son, after playing, said to give these 4 stars, so he enjoyed it even though the bubbles were not indestructible and they did pop after a little bit. It might get a bit messy as well, with the bubble solution (which is non-toxic). Also, it's important to follow the directions on how to blow the bubbles and what size.

Bottom line is that I'm giving them 3.5 stars overall and rounding up to 4, but I wouldn't pay too much for these because they do only provide limited entertainment. The commercial does exaggerate the fun and indestructibility of the bubbles, but I'm not reviewing the truthfulness of the commercial. My 7 year old son said he had fun with them so that's what matters most.

NOTE: I was sent a free product sample for review. I was not paid or told what to write.",Works but bubble are not indestructible; important to follow the directions,False,
B012WHM66O,2.0,"These didn't work well for us.  Yes, they do make larger than normal bubbles (although the same result can be achieved using a larger wand with normal bubble products).  And being able to blow the bubble rather than wave a wand is an interesting feature.  But overall, this is just a bubble product - it doesn't work any better than normal bubble solution you can buy at any big box store.  The gloves provide absolutely no advantage and in fact are more likely to cause the bubbles to pop.  We had better luck with just our wet bare hands.  The amount of bubble solution provided is fairly small - my daughters used it up in about an hour and refills aren't cheap.

I don't recommend this product - just get the cheap stuff or make your own.

B012WHM66O,5.0,"There's nothing like activities you can do with kids of all ages that will not just capture their attention but make them WANT to participate. That is exactly what JUGGLE BUBBLES does, and with one box they give you everything you need to create hours of fun.

I had seen the commercials on television, but we all know that things can sometimes seem too good to be true. Not so in this case. Through the activity box you are equipped with EVERYTHING you will need to get started: the bubble tray, the bubble blower, the special bubble solution and the pair of gloves that makes this so much more than your normal ""blowing bubbles"" experience.

Now, you should read the instructions (though it is pretty simple to get started) so that you know the key to 1) properly blowing the bubbles and 2) how to release it from the blower. Once you get that part down, let the fun begin!

My nephew Atavion (who's 7 years old) LOVED it from the very beginning, and everytime he comes over to the house he wants to ""play with the bubbles"". If you purchase it online you can get 2 activity boxes for the price of one, therefore doubling the experience and making it easier to enjoy it with a playmate. Before we got a second box, I simply gave my nephew one glove and my cousin the other and let them play that way. Not as convenient but it will do if you just happen to buy one box and have to wait until you get another.

I received a free sample for review.

Talk about tiny... this little quadcopter fits in the palm of my hand. The controller is also quite small, so much so that folks with large hands may be a bit challenged to use it effectively.

The quadcopter comes with an extra set of props, and a USB charging cable. The USB plug has an LED indicator that is on when charging is occuring. If the light is off, you are fully charged. The battery in the quadcopter built-in and you can't swap out batteries to continue flying once the battery is depleted. You get about 7 or 8 minutes of fly time and charging the battery only takes about 30 minutes.

The controller needs 2 AAA batteries (not provided). It has the expected trim adjustment buttons. There are two modes of operation, mode 1 offers less performance than mode 2. You change modes by pressing the left control down. You've also got the ability to do  360 degree flips. Press the right control down until you hear the beep then move the controller up-down-left or right to flip in that direction.

It's a nimble little quadcopter that is quite a bit of fun to fly.",Tiny little quadcopter that is fun to fly and easy to learn.,False,
B0148GJ1QK,5.0,"Little smaller then I was expecting having watched some video's.
Reminded me of the matchbox cars I had as a kid, scale is same, and makes me think of how far technology has come. Price of a toy, but the technology of the future. Good deal. :)

Never been a console gamer, and this was my first quad. So had some difficulty getting use to flying it. But I found hovering just above the floor makes it so you don't have to worry about elevation adjustment so much (prop backwash gives a buffer) and can focus on getting use to directional control. Now I can fly it around alright, though i still need more practice. A larger drone might of been a easier learning model, larger props probably more forgiving in control, though this being so small makes it more forgiving of crashes. /shrug

Update: Gotten a lot better at controlling/flying it. Just took some practice. Somehow I'm still on the first set of blades, though I came real close to loosing one outside. Very hard to see in the grass.

B0148GJ1QK,3.0,"While I appreciate that the company making this drone went through considerable effort to release a nice product, it just doesn't perform as well as others in its class.  The instructions and packaging are truly a step (or two) above the typical imported drone - this one is akin to one you'd find in a retail store or hobby shop.  But, I found this drone more difficult to fly - not as stable, less trim controls, and a more basic remote than drones you can buy for under $20 if you know where to look.  Specifically, I have the ""Sbego"" FQ777 and it's more easily controlled than this one, plus has a few extra features like headless mode and return-to-home.

This one has a very short range, that seemed to top out at around 40-50 feet, which is well short of most others (even other TRNDlabs models).  It also just seems more difficult to trim out and get flying well.  But, on the up side, it's construction and accessories were on-par with others, the box and instructions are something you could give as a gift and not get funny looks wondering how much (or how little) you paid for it.

B016C7879K,5.0,"This was originally as far as I know supposed to be a Target exclusive but like many ""store"" exclusives, they still end up on Amazon at some point. The thing here though is that most of those exclusives end up on Amazon for over inflated ridiculous prices just way past the regular retail if you were able to get it at that store it was exclusive to. This one isn't one of those cases. This set was originally $50 in Target stores and select few that still had some put them on clearance for great deals but long story short, if you're about to snag this at the current $26 price tag it just dropped to or for anything close to that...you're getting a great deal. While $50 would still probably not be a terrible price for 3 Marvel Legends, they do not include any build a figure parts or any accessories whatsoever and with the exception of some new parts like head sculpts on Vision and Hulk, they're essentially figures we've already seen, just re-tooled, re-painted and re-worked into ""new"" figures. So the $25-40 range that they bounce around at on here is much more reasonable.

Now onto the figures themselves...

Hulk: A great figure. Actually based on the Age of Ultron movie Hulk figures body mold just a new paint job (slightly different tone of green, differences on the pants) and most notably...a new, comic style head sculpt.  For those that own that figure, you already know the articulation. For those that don't, most of it is your standard Legends articulation. Shoulders, bicep/elbow, wrist, head, chest, knees, ankle pivot/etc. The one thing that these Hulks do lack that most Legends don't that DOES bother me some is the lack of waist articulation. But with the chest articulation to still give him dynamic turns to the side, it's not missed quite as bad as it could be.

Vision: Basically the same Vision figure that came in the Marvel Legends Avengers Series (Hulkbuster Build A Figure set). EXCEPT an all new paint job, and sometimes lack thereof. He is a mix of translucent plastic and white paint to make for a really unique and cool figure! Really simple yet beautiful paint work, great articulation. A solid figure that I really enjoy! If any complaints existed it would maybe just be that it'd be nice to see the cape in a somewhat softer plastic.

Ultron: Actually this figure is a re-deco of the Amazing Spider-Man Legends BEETLE from a good while back. The differences are some new parts and of course a new head sculpt and new paint job. A great figure though that I feel captures Ultron very well and is probably my favorite Ultron figure, as far as Legends go anyways (I still think the best representation of him is the Marvel Select figure) but overall this figure features a really well done design, great paint job and great articulation. Perfect as your Ultron or Ultron army drones for your Marvel Legends collection!

Overall a fun set and since I was able to snag it on here when it was about $32 which comes down to just a bit over $10 a figure...I'm really happy about that. And for those reading this...it's even cheaper now...so go get 'em! :)",Avengers,True,7.0

There are 6 different flying objects you can make from a airplane and kite to a boomerang and 8 assigned activities you may do with these objects to learn about why they fly and move, such as why does a boomerang fly and then turn around. My son loved the boomerang the best! My son is seven and needed some assistance putting these together, but not too much help. He was able to do the activities but we did them together.

You will need a hair dryer and a few other items typically found in the home.  In an ideal world, all of these experiments would work perfectly every time but there is as much to learn from knowing what should have happened and discussing why it didn't.

Now the countdown to her birthday begins!  I'll update this post when she has had a chance to explore and share her experience with me.

Now to Ravensburger, I want to say something.  You have three children photographed on the cover enjoying this science kit.  All three of them boys.  Are you suggesting that girls do not like making flying objects or experimenting with engineering?

This kit provides very high quality components, makes it very easy to experiment with options and add slight modifications to see how things behave. We have tested flight in calm air, with a big industrial fan blowing etc to explain how pressure differential works.  There are so many applications to the kit, the limit is on the teachers ability to explain and demonstrate the various concepts behind flight.  I would suggest the adult to do some pre-study on the various concepts before to get the best use out of this kit.",Great kit for curious minds.,False,
B01CLVLFK4,2.0,"Maybe I was expecting too much (like for my 8 year old to be able to do this kit by herself), but there are a lot of other materials needed to do these projects and A LOT of parent instructions and teaching.

There's a lot of parent lead teaching that's needed for this kit and honestly if I had that much time I could have cut my own piece of paper?  Here's a list of materials you will need to provide to finish this kit:  yarn, hairdryer, table, scissors, tape, glue, pen, ""enough space"", a large outside area, and a lot of patience and a few hours. I have no idea why they couldn't cut the straw themselves or include a glue stick or piece of yard for almost $30.

The flying objects are easy to put together & the manual is great & has nice, colorful illustrations. Some materials you will need to complete the projects are not included, but things you usually have around the house (tape, scissors, glue, etc). I like that there are 8 different projects you can make, & that it is a learning experience that encourages interaction with child & parent. This set can be for a girl or a boy, & I think it would be good for ages 7+.

Overall, I give it a solid 4 stars.",Educational for Girls & Boys,False,
B01CLVLFK4,4.0,"My science-oriented granddaughter really enjoys science ""kits"" for young people, and this is no exception. Though at 7 she's younger than the recommended age range for this set, she's very intelligent, and so she gets a lot of fun, as well as knowledge, from it. Something to keep in mind as you evaluate it for your own young'un.

This set is oriented toward aeronautics, and has some fun ""experiments"" to try. We started right in with the ""handheld helicopter"". It only took a couple of minutes to snap together, and then it was time for takeoff! Easy to assemble and understand, and fun to play with, it made it very easy for me to explain to her the principles involved in how it works, and just as easy for her to understand. There are several other projects in this set to build, too.

None of these kits are cheap, but this one seems reasonably priced for what you get. Overall a solid 4 stars.",Entertaining and educational,False,2.0
B01CLVLFK4,2.0,"The best thing about this science kit is the booklet, which has lessons in aerodynamics, the history of flying, and various types of flying objects.  If you have a child who has the interest and patience to read through it, you might want to consider buying this product (when it is on sale).  Or, I could just send you my copy for the price of the postage.
The box indicates there are 8 Amazing Activities, which include a wind tunnel, ball in air current, handheld helicopter, Frisbee, boomerang, kite and two gliders. After having tested out this science kit, Im not sure amazing is the right word to describe these activities, at least not the majority of them.
Once this package arrived in the mail, I gathered my kids around and got them excited to build flying objects.  First up in the booklet was the wind tunnel.  I got discouraged when I saw the list of other materials needed. I probably had everything it required, yarn, scissors, tape, table, hairdryer, but in the time it would have taken to gather those things, I knew I would have lost my kids interest.  **So, if you attempt this, know that there is some prep work.
We skipped over to the ball in air current.  This involves trying to keep a Styrofoam ball in the air with your own hairdryer.  Interest in this activity lasted less than a minute.  About as long as it took to retrieve the hairdryer and get it set up.  It didn't help that I wasn't great at keeping the ball in the air.  If you want to recreate this at home, buy a much cheaper Styrofoam ball at a craft store.
Next up, handheld helicopter and Frisbee.  The helicopter is about the size of your hand but has some impressive flying ability.  My younger ones (6 & 3) loved it but they also broke it pretty quickly.  The Frisbee is only 1.5 in diameter.  We never got a stable flight farther than a few feet.  Most of the time it nose-dived to the ground.  Both of these seem like items found in a dollar store.
The kite is about the size of a standard piece of paper and the boomerang is four pieces of card stock glued together to make a cross.  These are entertaining for kids to build but will probably be put on a shelf to collect dust after a couple minutes of test flights.
The gliders are fun to build, although the directions and drawings were a bit unclear.  Making adjustments to achieve the best flight is a good learning experience, and the booklet contains a great lesson on gliders.
Overall, I was disappointed because the labeling and graphics on the box and the price of the kit (currently $28), led me to believe this would be amazing. Maybe it would have been before the invention of the internet, or drones.  I actually bought a drone last year for less than the cost of this flying objects kit.",The best thing about this science kit is the booklet,False,3.0
B01CLVLFK4,4.0,"This is definitely a fun activity - no doubt, but there was more that could have been done.

It is essentially (a) a set of airplance/glider paper cut-outs which you can assemble into paper airplances - ok, something thicker and stronger, but something which is still paper (b) a Kit and a small foam ball kit for explaining bernoulli's principle

It also comes with a book which teaches the basics of aerodynamics - my daughter did not have the patience to listen through it, but I did anyway read through it.

What I would have desired is
(1) a small glue pack - everyone is expected to have it at home, but try searching for it and i can never find it :) include a small one in the kit
(2) Instead of paper - this could have included thin wood so that it could have lasted a bit longer","Good, but not great",False,
B01CLVLFK4,5.0,"This is really a fun kit.  It comes with many objects that you can use to create your own flying creations.  The contents include:
1. styrofoam ball
2.  wing profile
3.  straw
4.  hand propeller
5.  mini frisbee
6.  boomerang
7.  walkalong glider template
8.  2 gliders
9.  kite string
10.  kite
11.  sheet of thin paper

Extra household items needed to complete some of the activities.  Like a fan or a hair dryer can be used to give the styrofoam ball lift off.  The instruction manual gives you some ideas of how to combine the contents to make flying objects.  You can use your own creativity, however, to come up with more ideas.

This set is definitely intended for children 8+.  I would strongly recommend giving it to a child younger than that age.  There are many objects that young children could injure themselves with--like the straw.

You could get better quality model airplanes and other flying objects, for example, and get a good book about flight from the library, and it would be a better experience, I'd think.",Just okay,False,
B01CLVLFK4,4.0,"What makes this kit worthwhile?
 The fact that it is well thought out;
 You notice the input from educators and experts in the field of flight;
 it has great instructions and inspiration in the booklet;
 almost all materials are provided;
 there is a huge variety of flying objects without overlap of concepts;
 it contains many projects allowing for many completely different play/learn sessions;
 it says age 8 and up but, really, if the child already has an interest in how flying machines work, you could start as early as 6.
 Although it does require some components that are not provided, these are items found in every home. (Possible exception: yarn)

What makes the purchase a bit iffy?
 You are paying, mostly, for the thought, expertise, and effort that went into compiling this assortment and providing the supporting instructionsthe materials provided are really inexpensive (i.e. Styrofoam ball, a drinking straw, a very mini Frisbee, etc.) Of course, the fact that they are inexpensive and easy-to-find components does mean that, as long as you keep the instructions, you can recreate the experience later with a younger child.

Inside the box, though, you find stiff plastic coated flat paper with punch-out shapes of wings etc.  -- in other words, these are ""paper airplanes"" made of a substance a bit stronger than paper.  See below for an image of what's in the box. The second image shows the compartment under the flat pages of pop-outs with the tools that come with the set.

My boys are having a blast putting it all together and some of the planes fly REALLY nice which they are excited about.  I love that it has enough for 8 projects; great for a family instead of just a set for one kid.

Although value wise it may not be your best set, it is a complete set, not only with the supplies you need, but also, and most importantly, with the educational booklet that talks about aerodynamics and the like. It explains a lot in there, which is perfect to go along with the ""toys"" in the box.  These are not just planes; it has the two gliders, but it also has a boomerang, helicopter (just the top blade part,) and a floating ball among other items.  So a mix between gliders and experiments done with aerodynamics.

Overall I am happy, and my boys love science and just messing around to see how stuff works; so this set is perfect for them to learn and do on their own, which is what I wanted. If your child is less inclined towards this stuff naturally, you may need to work with him to encourage some of the other experiments and make it a learning experience, but for our family, it was perfect to keep them busy and give me a chance to get more done around the house!",Not just planes; an aerodynamics science kit and booklet along with gliders all in one!,False,

Mostly, he just likes to whack the bigger beads and watch them spin, but he will hold onto the smaller ones and slide them back and forth.

B000062SQA,5.0,Thomas and Friends cost a premium and if you have a train mad child you really need lots of track.  Getting enough to make a really good track is difficult if you have to pay this much and haven't won the lottery but these are worth the extra money.  They are perfect for getting track to join when they are just a bit off.  They do curve sharply if you need it but we find that sharp curves make for lots of derailing and frustration but that seems to be the case with all sharp curves so it isn't just these tracks.  We have four and they do make a great addition to the layouts we do (I have a five year old) and he now can do much of the building himself.,One of the only tracks worth buying in the brand,True,
B000062SQA,5.0,This Wacky Track is SO very helpful in connecting 2 train segments that cannot be connected with the standard wooden tracks.

B00008CQM0,2.0,Got this as an Easter gift for my daughter.  She loves it because it's dragon tales but she may be a little too young for it.  She is 5.  I personally think the game is stupid and takes forever for the game to end.  It goes on and on and on until someone completes a puzzle.,Too long to win,True,
B00008CQM0,3.0,My daughter somewhat enjoyed playing this game but only because it had a dragon tale theme. This game is very boring even for her and she was 3. There just isn't much to it - you takes turns at the spinner and move around the circle that's about it. Even Candy Land has a spot where you lose a turn or cards that will send you forward or back - this game doesn't.,Boring Game,True,
B00008CQM0,4.0,"My daughter fell in love with this show towards the end of its PBS run.  There was not a lot of toys or games for this show because of this.  This is a nice little game that is easy for kids to play, and if you loved the show, its PERFECT.  Thanks",Somewhat Biased,True,
B00008CQM0,3.0,"Up to four players can participate in this game.  Each has a 6-piece puzzle to complete, and at the start of the game all puzzle pieces are turned upside down in a communal pile; when appropriate, players will choose 1, 2 or 3 pieces and keep those that add to their unique puzzle.  Movement is through the use of a spinner, and sometimes players will dance or sing for extra puzzle pieces, or choose a place to ""jump to"".  The strength of the game is that there are a number of skills employed and it is a treat for real Dragon Tales enthusiasts; however, the game is not terribly challenging and will not remain interesting overlong.",multi-faceted but not very challenging,False,10.0
B00008CQM0,4.0,"First the positive- this game is fun for young children. It encourages children to think a little bit as they land on places where they can jump to anywhere on the board. And, the kids do have to put a six piece puzzle together.
Second, the not so positive- this game is not so fun for adults. There are other fun games that both kids and adults can play. This game is also very easy. VERY EASY for a four year old and yet four year olds are what the Dragon Tale game and show is supposed to be geared for, so there is not a good match there in my opinion.
Basically your child will have a game token with one of the Dragon Tale characters on it. You spin a spinner and move your piece that many places. You land on some places where you get to pick a puzzle piece up and some you have to give up a puzzle piece. When you have collected your puzzle pieces together and made your puzzle work, you have won the game. There are only about four spots that provide you the opportunity to pick up a piece or lose a piece. Also, one spot lets you pick up three pieces at once and another spot lets you pick where you want to go on the board. So, depending on how the game goes- it can be over VERY quick or last a long time.
There are some great games out there for young children. Penguin Pat is one we have enjoyed, Memory and others. This one is fine if yoru child LOVES Dragon Tales and will enjoy it because of the show connection. However, there are other games I'd get over this one.
Enjoy.",Not a favorite in our home,False,28.0

All things that should have been included in the original kit.  Voyager sells a photo-etch set that truly does this model kit justice.  As for the kit itself, the fit of the parts is very good.  This is an older Tamiya kit so the parts fit is not up to todays Tamiya quality, but its still better than the similar Italeri model kit.  There is no soft top for the rear cargo deck.  Royal Models sells a resin canvas cover for the rear deck, but its priced higher than the actual model kit that its made for. And the front wheels cannot be positioned turned left or right.

B000LFUGY4,5.0,"This is an AWESOME kit of Tamiya's 2-1/2 Ton Cargo Truck in 1:35 scale. This kit came out in the very late 1990s. Kit also has multi-media parts meaning that the kit has plastic parts, clear plastic for the windshield, thread for the tow-winch, and hard rubber tires. Tires can be made to actually turn!!

Fit of kit was EXCELLENT!!! Probably one of the best kits from Tamiya that I have ever built. I did not have any fit problems of any kind. Kit practically built itself, it was that well crafted!! There is a very good rendition of an engine; excellent detail for the oil pan and drive train and complete undercarriage and exhaust system. Bed of cargo area has positional seats and bows for a tarp (not included).

Good interior of crew cab has steering wheel, pedals, and stick shifts (actual 2-1/2 trucks are quite barren). Excellent crew member also included and has great details and facial features. Clear plastic for the windshield and I positioned it using white glue (Elmer's glue). Just to be different, I scribed in some lines to make it look like the windshield has some damage.

Instruction sheet gives a brief history of the 2-1/2 Ton Cargo Truck in multiple languages and suggested paint and decal guides. Also included is an awesome history of the ""Red Ball Express"" - hundreds of cargo trucks of various sizes that were given the mission to transport desperately needed fuel and other supplies from the Normandy Beachhead to the quickly advancing Allied Armies. Vehicles of the ""Red Ball Express"" were primarily crewed by African American soldiers and served with great distinction and were vital to the success of the ""Red Ball Express"" and the advancing armies. The ""Red Ball Express"" is legendary in American military history.

Decals are given for 5 different vehicles and went on model without any problems. There are some minor accessory parts such as packs, fuel cans, spare tire. I wanted to fill the cargo bed with 55 gallon drums and used some after market kits. Shortly afterwards, Tamiya came out with an excellent accessory kit consisting of 55 gallon drum and 5 gallon fuel cans. Tamiya also came out with another accessory kit consisting of a .50 Caliber machine gun mount. Also, Tamiya's old kit of US soldiers in various sitting poses would be excellent to fill in the cargo area as well.

The US military 2-1/2 Ton Cargo Truck was so successful in its lifetime that it actually served the military until being finally replaced in the early 1990s. I remember operating one of these (though modified for the times) in the 1980s while stationed in Germany. Vehicle could go just about anywhere.

Overall, EXCELLENT kit. I rarely rate model kits as 5 star, but this kit built so well and fit was so good, just had to give the extra credit. Remember, this is a plastic model kit and construction is required. Paint and glue not included.",Great kit of WWII 2-1/2 Ton Cargo Truck.,False,8.0

B000WNL83S,5.0,"This foil elephant balloon was a great addition, both in the idea and in its size (33""), to our Animal Kingdom themed birthday party. My 3 year-old daughter loved it, the older kids were taken with it, and the adults admired it as well. It was pure coincidence that our backdrop was missing an elephant, so this was even more perfect!

We went to a party hire place to have it helium-filled and tied with curling ribbons, then held it down with a weight for the party, and for days after, my daughter had enjoyed walking the balloon around the house and playing with it. It is still floating a week later, though it had gone somewhat soft (not as plump) by the 5th or 6th day.

It was good fun while it lasted, and certainly worth every dollar seeing the look of enthrallment on her face when she first saw it.

The problem is that the age group this toy is targeted to doesn't have the attention span or desire to shake it constantly to hear the entire song. So they shake it a few times and then then the music stops. This happens once or twice and then this toy is consigned to the toybox, permanently.

Spend your money on something else, it's not worth it no matter what the cost.",Don't Waste Your Money,True,
B000XUA5HA,2.0,"This toy has little to do with music and a lot to do with coordination and strength.  The 2-year-old for whom it is presumably suited must: 1. catch on to depressing a button before shaking the toy; 2. have the muscular stength and aerobic endurance to shake the toy vigorously until the tune has come to its conclusion; 3. possess the motivation to attempt either of the aforementioned steps.

I frankly was wasted after shaking it violently for the entirety of ""Oh, Susanna,"" so I'm not sure what the remaining six tunes are (and in no shape to find out).  From the opening bars I was able to recognize Scott Joplin's ""The Entertainer,"" but the typically cheesy single-note sound provides little motivation for a huffin'-'n-puffin' grandpa to shake this ragtime staple to its conclusion.

This thing might work with a precocious Arnold--just promise the kid some greater reward than the song itself.  Or an adult in need of some exercise might find it convenient to use at their desk (just don't let your co-workers catch sight of you turning as red as the tambourine while trying to get it to play ""Don't you cry for me"").

Of course, there's always the possibility that an adult's working with the device will loosen it up enough for a tot to tempt a tune out of it.  Or perhaps this ""Magic Tambourine"" will work for those who have the magic touch.  It's not worth the fuss of returning, so we'll see how it goes over with my grandchild.

B001AQVRKK,3.0,"We have lots of Imaginext toys including several elaborate sets from the Batman line. My 5 year old loves Imaginext toys more than any other because they afford imaginative playtime with daddy.  He really wanted the Penguin and I thought the submarine would be a good set, but we found this Penguin on sale so we picked it up instead.  It has some good qualities.  The Penguin himself is a very interesting villain.  The spinning umbrella is a good accessory and the jetpack makes a nice counter point to the Batwing glider we have for Batman.  The prone penguin bird has a clever wheel under it so it (theoretically) glides across the floor like you'd expect a penguin to do.

This set falls short in a few ways.  The button that operates the umbrella is on a sliding gear so you pump it to keep the umbrella spinning.  It's a good idea but it means the umbrella doesn't work when the pack is tipped in certain directions.  My son thinks it's broken.  The wheeled penguin is a good idea but the bird is too light weight to actually make it useful.  The Penguin himself looks good, but his portly belly keeps his legs from moving more than a few centimeters so he can't sit down or fit into vehicles.  The umbrella has circles painted on it, but I'd rather it have a spiral pattern which would be better for hypnotically mesmerizing Batman.  The umbrella is also too small to make a believable shield.

I kind of wish I had held out for the submarine.  Now I don't want to buy the sub because I already have a Penguin, but the accessories in this kit aren't as good as others such as Two Face with the bank vault and coin shooter.","Daddy, what's wrong with this button?",False,

B001GWTCSC,2.0,"I bought this doll for my daughter because it was a neat concept and unique. However, after a few hours, I was sick of it. Yes, my daughter loved it; she spent all day playing with it. However, she would push on it and grab its legs and arms while it was trying to crawl. Within hours, it was broken, and it would make a loud clicking noise and refuse to crawl.

If this were a different toy, I would say my daughter abused it, but toddlers play with dolls, and so they should be made to withstand abuse. Any parent of toddlers knows that they throw toys, sit on them, bounce them against the wall and drop them. My daughter tried to stop the arms and legs from moving because she was curious, and I believe that most toddlers would wonder how to get them to stop moving.

The doll does a good job of crawling, unlike some toys that barely move.  So far this toy has been great.  The only problem that I can see is that when she picks up the baby doll while it is crawling, it continues trying to crawl, which makes a terrible sound like the geers are grinding or something.

B006CD3GF0,2.0,"As an avid collector of Transformers and a father who buys Transformer toys for my two children ages 5 and 8, I would highly recommend staying away from all ""Cyberverse"" Transformer toys.  They are small, not well constructed, and the paint job stinks.  It is easy to purchase them because they are priced cheaper and I do not feel Amazon or any other online retailer does a good job articulating the actual size of these toys.  For example, this one says ""5.5 x 8 inches.""  If you broke the limbs off of the toy and lined them up you might get five inches, but in real life this toy is a ""mini.""  Think the same size as the original G1 minibots from the 1980s.

Parents, the Cyberverse toys easily break when your kids play with them and the little weapons get lost easy.  I highly recommend the Transformer ""Prime"" series which are much larger, better made, and can easily be found on Amazon for a few dollars more.  They are superior toys, your kids will be happy, and they are modeled directly off the Prime animated series.

Collectors, the only reason to purchase the Cyberverse line is if you need some miniature figures to arrange around your ""Titans.""  I've seen a few collectors arrange these mini versions around their Omega Supreme or Metroplex to make them look bigger.

B006CD3844,5.0,"5 stars for a toy that earns it.  This figure is not in the current Transformer Prime TV line but it's a great revision of Wheeljack.  Dead End has a great repaint job from head to toe to swords.  The neon style painting is very attractive to me.  The head sculpt is amazing as it a grand remold from wheeljack.  Though mine Dead End has a loose leg, I will not count that against him, seeing as I can tighten it up with Tile & Vinyl Floor Polish w/ Future; applying it with a toothpick.

All the minor, hard to see mistakes Wheeljack had, has been fixed and/or improved with Dead End.  His transformation is solid, and his hands must be in their proper place, so see the hands from below so you can remember how to place them.  The LIGHTING on this figure is awesome!  Translucent green for the face is just jaw dropping and matches the lime green paint scheme for the swords, wheels, and some trim.

The swords are a bendable plastic and rounded at the tip so it's safe for well-minded kids.  i'd say ages 6 and up to be on the safe side; 5 depending upon the kid's mental affinity.  The poses this guy can get in is grea, and sunlight on him will make you grin with joy of how cool Dead End is.

Makes us smile when we play.",Get it if you can,True,
B006ROJIQU,5.0,"Don't let the boring theme put you off, this is actually a very fun game with some great dynamics that make interacting and strategizing more involved than it seems on the surface.

Basically, each turn is laying a tile next to you mill, which is pictured in the game as draining the land of water so that it can be farmed. You get points based on the harvest of the fields once each mill is surrounded. That's simple enough, and would get boring pretty quickly, but the Town Square stipulates a limited budget and limited resources, which you have to plot to try and work out in your favor so you get more valuable fields or mills - basically, the budget starts at 5 florens or guilders, but if you spend more on your turn then you effectively are giving a bigger budget for the next player, who can then spend a little or a lot and give a bigger or smaller budget to the next player, and so.

There's a simple version for learning, and then more fancy rules that involves Governors and so on for players once they get a handle on it, and it adds more depth.

Eurogames often skyrocket in price after a while because they (for some stupid reason) go out of print. If you like this kind of game, then **buy Seeland while you can!** because it's been discontinued. $25-30 is a very good price for a game this fun.

B00ATW9TYW,5.0,"This game is so much fun! I bought this for my 4-year-old daughter to play and she adores it! My daughter has speech delay problems, where communicating is not easy for her, so I bought this game to get her to talk more. The game includes a game board, a spinner, twelve blocks (3 orange, 3 blue, 3 purple, and 3 green), 2 sticks, challenge cards, and a smasher character. You spin the spinners where you can either get a blue, orange block, purple block, orange block, smasher, or challenge. If you get the smasher, the smasher character advances one spot. If you get the challenge, you pick from the challenge, do a small challenge like ""Roar like a dinosaur"", and then you get to pick whatever color block you want. All the players work together to stack blocks and make a tower. If the smasher gets to spot 9, you have to smash the tower down. For younger kids, flip over the game board and it's divided into the 4 colors of the blocks. Instead of stacking the blocks, you can just match the blocks to their correspondent colors. To move the blocks, you can use the sticks multiple ways. On one end, it has two cylinders sticking out which you can insert into the block, and on the other, it has a soft spongy white part. The white part makes it harder to move the blocks so it's a great challenge for more experienced kids. I love how it makes the opponent a smasher character instead of another human being. I also love how you work together to make a tower. It really emphasizes cooperation. I ask my daughter lots of questions while playing, like ""How many blocks are in the tower?"", to work on her speech. This game is great for all ages.

It's not overly exciting or dynamic game, for the most part someone is stacking a block with little danger of the tower falling. I can't see it becoming a favourite.

My main issue with the game is the age recommendation seems high. My 4 year old can stack the blocks with no difficulty using the foam ends. The only challenge is in the challenge spinner where him & another player have to use the sticks together to get the block stacked & even then he picked it up quickly. Maybe having 2 children work together it would be harder.",Nice game but buy it for younger than the age recommended to get any length of use out of it.,False,

The illustrations on maybe half of the cards are charming and substantial enough to work with. The other half I find scary for little ones or just bewildering. My own daughter, who is just shy of 3 y-o and who has an amazing imagination, can't work out anything with half of the cards.

B00EO4M970,5.0,"I have two different versions of the Harlock movie and prefer this one for the poseability and great accessories.  Highly detailed, makes a great display, and is something you can change up so you don't get bored with it.",Beautiful figure,True,
B00EO4M970,5.0,"I'll start by saying that I've been aware of this figure for months, and despite it being Harlock, it wasn't *my* Harlock, hero of my childhood. I know this figure corresponds with the movie released in Japan last year - and I can say this is a very faithful reproduction of that look, but at first glance I dismissed this as some new emo-style Harlock. Whatever.

When I found the figure on amazon - and saw that it was selling for less than half of what I was used to seeing online - I went for it. If nothing else, I reasoned, at least I can say - as a completionist-psycho-collector - that I *have* it. Like, 'yeah it sucks but I have it' or 'whatevs, I got it on sale, I have it' - my point in driving this point home is that my expectations were beyond low.

So when it came I was surprised to see, for one, that the box was so big. I have other Kai figures and was expecting the typical 9"" figure. Harlock is bigger, more like 10.25"".

The crown jewel in my Harlock collection is of course the Medicom RAH figure. This Kai figure is quite nearly the same height. So, if you missed the  Medicom figure - this May not be a bad substitute for you.

The amount of detail is stellar. Play Arts Kai make really nice figures, but even so - I'm willing to say they upped the ante for Harlock. The sculpt is over the top. It's truly, truly superb. That said, there are a couple design choices - I won't call them flaws - that detract from this figure being genuinely, mind-blowingly awesome.

The first is the plastic cape. I can imagine why they went with plastic - it's cheaper, I'm sure, and also by going with plastic the manufacturers are able to ensure the dramatic appearance of this figure. However, the plastic is heavy, it throws the balance of the figure off. It's also fairly inflexible, so it restricts the full movement of the arms. Obviously, it would have been nice if they'd gone with a cloth cape, so that you could take advantage of the ultra-posability of this figure. It would be nice, for example, if you could pose Harlock in his melancholy sitting pose on top of a pile of books, or what have you, mimicking his slouched-down in his seat position at the helm of the Arcadia.

The other odd design choice was to not include Mr. Bird as a separate figure, but as an accessory permanently adhered to Harlock's alternate collar. Yes, that's right, you have to swap out collars to include Mr. Bird. You pop off Harlock's head and switch out the separate piece of plastic from his cowl. On one hand, this is an interesting solution to a minor problem -- even Medicom went the obvious route and their Mr. Bird's feet just clip on to wherever you can make him fit. You would think Play Arts Kai would have sooner considered just doing foot-pegs - which I admit readily invite the problem of breakage - but to go *this* route and have Mr. Bird permanently attached to a spare collar just seems bizarre. Granted, when in use both the collar and Mr. Bird are secure, so...there's that.

Despite these complaints I'm pretty much in love with this figure - and I totally did not expect to be. Hence, I am not deducting any stars because of the few design choices I don't agree with. This figure is definitely bad-ass. I would think that most fans of Harlock would agree this is a respectful interpretation of our beloved space pirate, despite its flaws. You may or may not find some minor complaints with it - but overall this a great sculpt and a quality piece. Those qualities, in my opinion, are inarguable.",Flawed but surprisingly good.,True,7.0

The box came a little beat up and, unfortunately, the tin case it comes in took part of the blows as well, but the figures themselves were in perfect condition. Obviously my review on the packaging will be low, but that shouldn't take away from the review of the product itself.

The characters were designed with great detail, which is expected for an anniversary set. There were no issues with imperfections, joints, or chippings. Each character is encased in foam within the tin so you know they were serious about getting these figures to you in one piece. Inside the tin you get the figures and that's it, it may have been nice to get some kind of description with them, but you are getting this for the characters already knowing what they are about so I will not fault them for that.

Good quality, with the seams properly finished. Holds at least three Chessex sets of poly dice.

One star off because it has a bizarre tactile effect when the lining rubs against the outer bag that sets my teeth on edge. It's odd because I own a red-lined black velvet dice bag that doesn't have this issue, and I thought I was buying a duplicate of that. Obviously not.

So I don't ""love"" it.

Even my son, who is 13 years old liked it. I was surprised that this is like getting three cars in one, because the exteriors are easier removed and snapped on in a Lego type of style, which makes these cars super appealing. As an added bonus, the headlights also come on when driving it. You can easily raise and lower the front loader portion of this truck as well.

Not only do the pieces come apart which makes this completely adjustable, it also goes pretty fast for a kids car. I was surprised that this rotates in almost 360 degrees, and it easily makes 3-point turns.

The headlights come on and it makes nice siren noises. The antennae must be screwed onto the remote controller. This can be operated from several feet away from the remote control. The toggles are perfect for little hands, because the movements aren't too complex. The motions allow you to go forward and backwards, and then the other toggle allows you to rotate the wheels from left to right. When I moved it fast enough, then I was able to get it to rotate 360 degrees. It does awesome circles.

pros:

-it has a button that allows you to run the car with the sirens or choose to run it in silent mode.
-The car is a base unit that comes with 8 different pieces, effectively creating 4 different vehicles.
-It has headlights which come on while driving.
-the remote control has an antennae.
-It has goes in multiple directions, and is pretty fast for a kids remote control car.
-It has a front loader part that goes up and down, which makes this have the look of a play car that a child would make believe that it could drive.
-The colors are vibrant and appealing.
-The cars have faces on it.

cons:

-The only negative aspect to this car is the fact that it takes batteries instead of being rechargeable. However, this is easily remedied by buying rechargeable batteries and a charger.

summary:

This is a fun little truck with a variety of attachments, making this have the feel of legos, a toy truck that you would play with in the sand, and a remote control vehicle all in one. You get the variety of snack on pieces, which makes this feel like several cars in one, you have the headlights, which allows you to play with this even at night, and you have the high-powered antennae, which allows this to be driven, even several feet away from you without losing power. I think it not only visually appealing, it is a nice little starter truck for a young child that wants a remote vehicle.

B013ELF2BI,3.0,"This game is a deck building game with the theme of collecting gasses and isolating out the ones that get you points...I guess.

There are 4 gasses that comprise your deck of ascending tiers.  On your turn you can thin out the lowest tier of gas in your hand, if you are left with just the highest tier of gas then you can place that on the table and collecting enough will allow you to complete mission cards for points at game end.  You can also add new sets of all 4 gasses to your deck for money and use that money to buy equipment that makes the filtering of your gasses more efficient in one way or another.

The game works well, everything is well designed and flows pretty smoothly.  Once the game got up to speed, even with new players in the game, everything is easy to understand and turns and the game in general move at a really good pace.  At first glance I did not think this would be the case though, it certainly looks more daunting than it is though.

I just don't see the point of this game.  ""Fine"" or ""okay"" are not that complimentary adjectives to describe a game any more with SO many options out there.  And this game is just fine or okay.  There are a ton of deck builders that do what this does just as well or better so where does this one set itself apart?  It certainly isn't the theme which is so nebulous I didn't understand it or care to.  There's really nothing impressive about the art design.  So ultimately just a very forgettable game.",Fine deck building game.,False,
B013ELF2BI,5.0,"Xenon Profiteer comes with some good credentials: it was the winner of the 2014 Ion Award for Best Strategy Game, and it is also one of the few games that has a title beginning with the letter X, giving it a definite X factor.

The theme of the game is a unique one: it's about the difficult and expensive chemical process of isolating high purity Xenon.  But don't let that unusual theme put you off!  It is a deckbuilding game, but a clever one with a difference: you are adding cards to your deck as the game progresses, but it's equally important to remove cards from your deck, ""distilling"" elements so that you're left only with Xenon, which will help you fulfil contracts.  So it's your job to get rid of Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Krypton, thus isolating the precious Xenon. which will earn you points.  In the process, you'll also use money to buy upgrade cards to your Air Separation Facility that will make your system more efficient and powerful.  So in more ways than one, this game is a real breath of ""fresh air"" in the deckbuilding genre.

The concept of the game is really well done, and I really like the mechanism in which you're deconstructing your deck as well as constructing it.  The different Upgrade cards used to improve your Air Separation Facility ensure good variety, and there's numerous combos and strategies to explore.  Players also interact with ""bidding"" tokens, which reduce the price of cards you plan to purchase, and also require your opponents to pay you in the event they want that card.  So there's quite a few interesting decisions to be made, without it ever becoming brainburning.

Good with 2-4 players, Xenon Profiteer is probably more complex than most others in the Gryphon Games Bookshelf series, but it's a good entry deckbuilder, with great artwork and quality components, and it's an innovative and fun game that I'm enjoying immensely right now.  - EndersGame @ BGG",A game that is a breath of fresh air,False,
B013ELF2BI,5.0,"I backed this game through Kickstarter, indirectly. My friend backed at the level where he could get this game plus three others. I gave him some money so I could get a copy of the game. It is a great game. We've played with and without the expansion, both ways being fun.

There are multiple paths to victory. While one person may be pursuing one path another player might pursue another path and trigger the end game by surprise. Just because someone triggers the end game, victory is not guaranteed. There are plenty of opportunities to acquire points. We've had games that were separated by one point after everything was tallied.

The cards are great quality; they feel great when you hold them. Since this is a deck builder game you can end up with a rather large deck. However, as you're building your deck, you must also deconstruct it to accomplish certain tasks. The result is a fun game. Once you play a few times everything becomes second nature and the turns proceed smoothly. Our play time is typically less than the 45 minutes listed.",A great game,False,

With this kit, your child can dig and excavate the fossils of a dinosaur just like a professional geologist which is a scientist who studies the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the Earth as well as analyzes the history behind the finding. Ever since my youngest son watched the movie Jurassic Park when he was younger, he has had a huge obsession with anything that has to do with dinosaurs. He was very excited to get his hands on this fun kit. This awesome kit includes a brush, an excavating tool, a sandstone, bones, a platform, and simple instructions all inside a nice canister and lid. Your child can gently excavate the dinosaur bones from the sandstone and the fun part is to reconstruct the bones to create the fossil of a dinosaur, just like the ones you would see in the Museum of Natural History. Once your child has successfully reconstructed the dinosaur you can place it on the brown base and proudly display it. This is such a cool project if you want to spend some fun educational and quality time with your child or any child. This would also make a super cool gift for anyone and I highly recommend it.

B01A1A8LBS,4.0,"This dinosaur project was so fun. Having my kids do this, made my house quiet. Lol. They were so zoned in to this. This is very small but very engaging. In the cannister, you get yellow sandstone, brush, excavating tool, bones, instructions/paper displaying variety of dinosaurs and a platform for the fossil. This took my 2.5 year old about an hour to do (dad helped toward the end). The sandstone was easy to chisel off and I set up her fossil because it is very small. The bones were placed throughout the sand. Warning*** it can get very messy I suggest using newspaper underneath. She liked how it was set up and thought it was the coolest thing. The bones are small and an adult or older child will need to assemble and put on platform. It stayed in place too.

Overall, kiddo loved doing it and it was a fun project. If you have a younger kid, they may need some help. We discovered a Ornithomimus! What's cool is it is a surprise! Decent price and a great entertaining project.

For my toddler it lasted about 30 minutes of him chiseling away at it. The sand around it is solid but chisels well. I do wish that the chisel were slightly more pointed in order to be more helpful for chiseling. However, this does make the activity last longer so maybe it's dull on purpose?

The dinosaur is in pieces in the sand and it was a lot of fun to dig out the pieces. It's a great one time activity. I glued the dinosaur pieces together so that it could withstand a bit of play, as well. There is also a stand included so that the dinosaur can stand up.

B01BXCDH0I,5.0,"Well, it doesn't really matter whether I love them or not, but the 5-year-old was in tears when he heard Mixels were no longer being made, and almost turned inside out when he got this from his doting grandmother. Seven Mixels all at once was almost more than he could stand, he was so excited. Great toys, even though I generally deplore toys that can only be used to make/play with one way. The fact that each Mixel creature can be disassembled and then combined with others to make one BIG monster is a plus. Great small-motor skills practice, too. Note that many 5-year-olds will not be able to follow the schematic assembly directions, because there are teeny parts involved...but he persisted, and did. :)",Mixels...get 'em while they're available,True,
B01BXCDH0I,5.0,Cute little Mixels set with 3 different police vehicles. Son was very happy with them. Easy to build for my 8-year old.,Nice police set of Legos...son happy!,True,

B01CASGRGU,5.0,really only wanted the hyenas for my harley fig... lol,i really like this figure,True,
B01CASGRGU,5.0,"One of the perfect Animated series toys. I have no complaints about this one, the bonuses are great (the hyenas) and the toy (once you work the joints a little) is great, standing on his own, well balanced, looks accurate.",A great representation of the animated series' second Joker,False,
B01CASGRGU,5.0,all right thanks,Five Stars,True,
B01CASGRGU,5.0,I have different Joker figures from the 1990s Batman TAS series that came out but this one had the hyenas. I would have gotten the Christmas with the Joker figure except for that addition. Harley Quinn would have been better to have added them in the packaging. Still it is a good Joker for my display.,Great Joker,True,
B01CLVLFK4,4.0,Son loved it,Four Stars,True,
B01CLVLFK4,1.0,I was really disappointed in this kit. The airplanes are made out of paper. I assumed they would be made out of Styrofoam or cardboard. This isn't that can be reused. The quality of this is really poor.,Not worth the price.,True,
B01CLVLFK4,3.0,"My son found the insides of the box disappointing - they look very realistic on the outside but are essentially heavy cardstock coated paper that are assembled into objects. The booklet it comes with is glossy and has a lot of information; for most kids, it's going to be TOO much information, though. Only poppies really interested in flight will devour the booklet.

Be aware that many of the 8 ""exciting activities"" require additional components. For example, a wind tunnel requires a hairdryer, yarn, scissors, and tape, The hairdryer also does double duty with keeping a styrofoam ball in the air. Whooo. The frisbee is lacking in durability and aerodynamics - and if your kid has already thrown a frisbee, (s)he will be completely unimpressed.

The gliders are by far the best part - and since they are adjustable, kids can learn how to make small changes and how that impacts aerodynamics.

Overall, for what it is, kids who would be impressed by most of the activities will be too young to use it without a lot of adult supervision. Older kids who could do it themselves will find it lacking, except for the gliders.",Box oversells what it is.,False,
B01CLVLFK4,5.0,"This is certainly an adult/child project.  It works well both in a school setting and at home.  There are eight different projects.  Youll probably want to limit yourself to one or two at a time.  Trying to do too much can be a bit overwhelming.  Make no mistake about it. . .  This is not really a toy, but a science kit all about aerodynamics.  The instruction book / manual does a good job with instructions and illustrations.  Everything is very bright and colorful.  Great adult/child project for kids who like planes.",Adult/Child Aerodynamic Science Projects,False,
B01CLVLFK4,4.0,"I love to get my sons STEM activities. Anytime my children can learn and have fun doing it is a win-win for me. This type of kit is becoming popular as I have seen many different brands with pretty much the same type of projects and materials provided.

I find that these kits are a little pricey for what is provided, you must supplement other items such as yarn, tape, etc. You do get the main articles needed such as the materials to make the gliders, propeller, straw, kite string, etc.

The instruction manual is more detailed than Ive seen in some other kits. I think the main feature of these kits is the convenience of having it all come together with instructions. You could do some work and round up your own items, print off instruction from online, and make your own but with the kit, most of the work has been done for you.",Convenience of Having a Kit with Instructions,False,
B01CLVLFK4,2.0,"This makes some fine paper airplanes and flying objects, and the overall quality is up to Ravensburger's high standards, but there are a few quibbles.

First, some of the paper is actually a little too stiff to use for the devices you're required to make, resulting in an end product that's actually LESS durable than it would be if they'd used a different grade of paper or creased the pages.

Second, the instructions could be clearer. I understood them quite well, and most of them had accompanying pictures, but not all did and my son's, 9 and 13, found them a bit confusing at times, and I can understand why.

Third is the price point. You could get a book with better descriptions, explanations and instructions and a few hundred sheets of appropriate paper for considerably less than the cost of this set.

It's not a bad idea for a gift - who wants a gift of a book and a stack of paper from Staples? - but is otherwise eminently replaceable.",Too pricey for the problems,False,
B01CLVLFK4,3.0,"This science kit is a good way to get kids interested in the science of aerodynamics which has the potential to either spur your child into wanting to learn more. It is early exposure to certain things that sets to path your child may or may not take, so I think it's important to expose them to as much as possible and see where it leads.

I gave this kit only 3 stars for a couple of reasons. One, it's not a complete kit. You do have to provide some things yourself to get the full effect and get as much out of this kit as possible. The other reason is that I feel that it is too expensive at the current price of $28.22 for what you get. If this sets off a desire to learn more about the subject, then great, you've gotten your money's worth out of it. If not, then it's nearly $30.00 down the drain.

The kit is pretty simple. It comes with the supplies for 8 experiments but you will need to have other supplies on hand such as glue, scissors, tape, yarn, hair dryer, etc.",You will need additional supplies to complete the experiments.,False,
B01CLVLFK4,4.0,"When I first examined the contents, I was a little disappointed at the quality of the cardstock used for the gliders and boomerang, then I realized that you have to glue several layers together which gives you a much sturdier end project.  Don't forget the glue if you are giving this as a gift, because it is not included.  You will also need a plate, a hairdryer, scissors, a pen and pencil and yarn.

The pieces practically fall away from the cardstock when lift it out of the box, so there's no need to ""punch out the pieces"" and risk tearing or bending them.  Gluing and assembling is not difficult, but you must wait for the glue to dry completely before performing any of the experiments.

My crafty ten year old enjoyed building the projects and then testing them out.  The included booklet is very interesting and informative.

If you have a little person in your life that is interested in science, this is a nice way to get them really involved in a project and to think about how  things work.",Fun and Educational.,False,

B01FSTY7GU,5.0,"These pegs are lots of fun. We've had the regular building set for years, but this new action set adds to the fun by letting you build sideways and by having wheels.
