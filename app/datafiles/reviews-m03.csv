B000S14PFM,5.0,"Sakura gel pens are my FAVORITE, and these glaze pens leave a shiny, acrylic-like 3-D effect on the paper.  Let dry between each layer and you can continuously build up the effect.  Only downside - If you use them to fill in large areas, gel will run out quickly.  Still my favorite gel pens.","Sakura gel pens are my FAVORITE, and these glaze pens leave a shiny",True,

B000S14PFM,5.0,"These pens are awesome in every way!  I use them for my artworks and for card making.  They add the perfect final touch to all my projects.  They work great on non-porous surfaces, but I use them on paper, mostly.  I love the colors and the shiny, slightly raised appearance.  Note that the 3D effect will be less pronounced on a porous surface such as paper. Sakura Gelly Roll pens are the best and cannot be beat.  I love them all! :",Yet another outstanding Sakura Gelly Roll product. What's not to love?,True,

B000S14PFM,5.0,"I'm new to Sakura Jelly Rolls and recently purchased the 74ct set. Well, I'm hooked. I'm up to 158 pens total. These were well packaged with the wax tips on the nib for protection. Each one wrote smoothly without any skips. I only had to lightly tap one and it was fine. These do puff up some but not like the Souffle set. The drying time is pretty much the same as the other Sakura Jelly Rolls. I bought the BTSKY 160ct pencil case and it holds all of them nicely. Look for my review with pictures to get the right one because they sell a lot of different ones.",Another Sakura big hit.,True,
B000S14PFM,5.0,"I use these for bullet journaling, and they are beautiful.  The colors stars shiny and appear wet.  The colors are fabulous, with extremely strong pigmentation, and a good, smooth flow.  Sakura is known for quality, and this product is one of the reasons why.

The only trouble is, they do stay wet for a very long time. These are maybe the slowest drying pens I've ever seen, so plan careful so to not risk smearing the ink (I do a right hand tasks column, before the left side notes and events with any pen but this) and let the page sit open a few minutes, else it will stick to the facing page.  Definitely not for left-handed writers.","Good, but needs a little care to use",True,

They are transparent and can be used over text or image without covering it up; but they have such strong and vivid colors that they can easily be used by themselves on light colored paper. The flow of the Glaze pens is thicker and smoother than that of the other Gelly Roll pens, and it feels like luxury.

B000S14PFM,5.0,"I really like the Gelly Roll glaze pens the best, of the Gelly Roll pens. They are quite liquidity, they give a pretty shine. I have used them to color flowers on cards, very pretty. I also appreciate that you can see any lines within the color. The moonlight ones by Gelly Roll obsure what is under the color. These are my favorite of the Gelly Roll pens. They also contain quite a bit of ink.  These work the best if you have larger open areas to color. You don't want them for fine spaces!",Beautiful coloring pens for larger open areas to color,True,3

B000S14PFM,5.0,"Good pens, great colors. They go on nicely, on decent paper.
Had one pen that seemed dry from the start, but the rest were fine, so that was probably the exception to the rule.
Be sure you either let the work dry completely, or use a blotter of some kind under your hand, as they are a bit slower to dry than usual.

B000S14PFM,5.0,Im so in love with these wonderful gelly roll pens! The ink flows good and they are like 3D when the pens dries. The longer you keep the pen on paper the thicker the ink gets. They are so much fun to color with. I plan on buying more. I highly recommend these pens.,Gelly Roll Pens-A Great Find & Price,True,
B000S14PFM,5.0,"These are not for dark paper, Use on glossy or light colors. The pen comes with a plastic tip cover, keep this as it will increase the life of your pen nib and ink. Write slowly so the ink will be thicker, the thicker the stroke the more puffy it will turn out.  If you are using more than one color, wait for your first color to dry so they do not bleed together. These pens are amazing quality and worth every penny. I have one set and plan on ordering more for backup when they are all gone. They are easy to use up as the ink needs to come out thick.

B000S14PFM,5.0,"I work with polymer clay and use these pens for adding accent color, outlining areas, adding more depth to leaves, vines and flowers, and they're especially great for Fairy Wings.  I usually use a translucent clay, some sparkle, and after baking I highlight the entire outer edge of the wings and the interior veins.  You have to give it a few coats to get an appreciable raised area but it's worth it; it really makes them pop.  It would be a real pain and take forever to try and achieve the same effect using paints and a brush.","Great effects, Multiple uses",True,2

B000S14PFM,5.0,"Great pens! They come with sealed clear transparent glue so the gel doesn't leak out, so remove this before using the pens. Once it hits paper it's on like donkey kong so don't be slow about it unless you want the bubbled raised look which is a cool effect as well. I tried to use the white color for whiskers but it didn't work so well. They do write over colored pencils but the white one would have to be layered especially over black. Layering white over black looks like a milky white and the more you layer, the more air bubbles in the finished result so be careful layering. I have only tried wax pencils so far. The pen that works for whiskers would be my Sanford signo uniball gel pen. Another note, there are two white gel pens, 1 is white 1 is clear and you can't tell the two apart so I used the black gel pen to place a dot on the top of 1 of them to tell them apart since they aren't labeled.",Great pens! They come with sealed clear transparent glue ...,True,2

B000S14PFM,4.0,"I just started using these for accents or outlines in adult coloring books, and I love them! I took away one star because the do flow quickly and take a while to get used to using. And you definitely want to wait at least 5 minutes for it to dry. I let it dry while I color in another book, so I don't get impatient. The first photo shows the black as outline. It's hard to see in the photo but it is shiny and raised. This was a calendar, and it did not bleed through. In the second photo I used a book that had thinner paper, and there was some bleed through. I love how the glitter on the stems and the glaze on the twirls interact. I used 2 coats of the green glaze, and I'm not quite pleased with the results; I need more practice!  The blue, red, yellow and orange swirls are one coat of glaze. I just ordered another set with more colors!",Great for accents and outlines,True,10

B000S14PFM,5.0,This is the coolest thing. You use these pens and they create a raised effect. I used them for letter writing and addressing envelopes. Really fun product and the ink flows like a dream.,I love these pens they are so different,True,
B000S14PFM,4.0,If you want something different then these are your pens. The colors are good but I suggest that you use them in large areas as the ink comes out quickly. For more stand out glaze let the ink dry and put on a second coat.,Different kind of gel pen,True,

B000S14PFM,5.0,"I purchased the Bright Color 10 pack, in addition to the Basic Color 10 pack. The Bright set includes: clear #800, yellow #803, orange #805, red #819, pink #820, rose #821, purple #824, green #829, blue #836, and black #849.
I also purchased the 6 pack, which was mislabeled. I mistakenly thought I would be getting 3 additional colors, not included in the two sets, but they were all duplicates. That is okay with me, though, as these pens are so much fun to use! I am sure I will put the extras to use, or share them with my daughters, the budding artists:)
When you first receive your beloved Glaze pens, each one has a small plastic seal on the tip of the nib. Simply pull it off, and follow the instructions on the package. You may want to ""get your pen going"" on a scratch piece of paper, but I didn't really find this necessary. As stated, to achieve a raised effect, slowly move the pen, to get a nice ink flow. Don't rush! You can also achieve some really interesting, and pretty color combinations, by mixing inks, before they dry, which is about 20 seconds. To REALLY dry, I suggest a minute, if you have a heavy amount of ink.
I have thoroughly enjoyed the Glaze pens, and have just gotten started!!! They have so many applications! Coloring, Zentangles, drawing, mixed media, glass, ceramic, etc. Also, they look fabulous on both light, and dark, surfaces!

B000S14PFM,5.0,"I debated on these for a good month... I kept looking at them and finally decided to try them out and I am glad I did! I have never purchased anything Sakura that was not outstanding and the Glaze pens are no exception. They really do give a 3D effect when you color with them!!! You do need to give them about 10 minutes or so to dry but very well worth it! The first time I used them, I colored a section and they truly gave a ""puffed"" up appearance. After I was done with my picture I had an area that just did not blend in well with the vibrancy of the rest of the page I decided to go over the area with the clear pen and it gave that area a beautiful sheen which tied the picture together very well. I LOVE these pens!!!",GREAT FOR COLORING!!!!!!!,True,2
B000S14PFM,5.0,"I am loving these Sakura Glazes! Even if just coloring a picture, they really do bring a whole new dimension to any crafting project! The ink comes out very liberally, so I suggest pushing down once and then lift off of the paper in order to prevent using more ink than intended-it will cover a decent amount once releasing the ink. They come with a little protective cover on the tip-I leave mine on after every use-better for avoiding leaks(which I've never had a problem with Sakura!). So far so good! I highly recommend this for craft purposes of all types from simply coloring, to creating a unique piece of art sure to catch the eye of any being(well, except for dogs-they don't really care how many bright colors we silly humans use, ha)!

(However, they don't randomly spit out blobs or anything.)  They are bright colors but have a slight translucence that helps with the ""glaze"" appearance.  Thus, they look good on top of markers (and will look a little different over different colors) and they look great alone.  I've been using them in Angie Grace coloring books (detailed mandalas/patterns) and am loving the results!  They do take a little time to dry, so you'll have to be careful.

I did use it for detail work on some stamps. So long as I moved fast I got the effect I wanted, although thicker that I was hoping, it still look good and professional.

B000S14PFM,4.0,"I bought this Sakura 38369 3D Pen Set for my preteen daughter who is into cartooning. She enjoys using these because she can tell that they give her drawings a subtle 3D quality (her friends even noticed the difference without her saying a word). However, we both feel that this set definitely needs a yellowish/golden tinted pen.

Any art set needs to at least include some type of variation of the 3 basic colors-red, blue and yellow. Since these pens are more ""earthy,"" a golden hue would be very appropriate-logically completing this set.

In order to get the basic colors, I'd recommend the Sakura 38370 (which is currently cheaper, as of this writing). That's a little disappointing, since we weren't looking for such a bright palette.

Instead, TWO white pens are included in the set. The white draws clear and are good for blending and adding additional gloss. However, the white color only emerges (clearly on colored paper) once the ink dries.

These pens give a smoother, thicker line than the cheaper gel pens I also purchased. They come with a tiny plastic bit on the ball tip (beneath the regular cap to further prevent premature dry-out).

If a yellowish pen was included instead of a duplicate white, this would be a 5-star review.",Good Quality for Subtle 3D-Incomplete Without Yellow Hue,True,4

B000S14PFM,5.0,"I bought the other (brighter) Glaze set a few months back and I absolutely love them. Unfortunately I pulled a stupid and left my cap off of the clear Glaze pen for a few weeks (I put my pens in a case), and I frowned when I went to use it and realized I had left the cap off of it. I couldn't find any open stock clear Glaze pens, and then I found these. I am a pen fanatic, I get excited when I get new pens, and since these had a WHITE Glaze pen AND a clear Glaze pen it was a no-brainer. I didn't have these colors. I have reviews on a few different writing utensils along with pictures of how they look from different angles on different kinds to paper, so I highly encourage you to view them. On the green colored pens, the one that looks darkest is actually the lighter green, and vice versa, so I highly recommend making a swatch; they don't come with the names of color on them either, so I made some up and labeled them (with a label maker, but you can always write it on a piece of paper and use clear tape to adhere it). It's a similar thing with the red and brown, they kind of look alike, but in good lighting you can make the distinction. They will take a bit to dry.

I can't emphasize the love I have for the clear Glaze pen, it gives almost like an embossing effect, but without the powder mess that gets everywhere and a heat tool.",The Amazing Glaze!,True,27

B000S14PFM,5.0,"Very cool pens!  I'm still playing around with them, but from what I've seen so far, I'm quite impressed.  I did notice that if you are decorating a drinking glass, that the ink will tend to gather, kind of pool up, at the bottom part of your artwork, so I think laying the glass on it's side will keep the ink more evenly distributed.  I also use them to sign my company name on glass items, such as votive candle holders that I've decorated with Swarovski Rhinestones, so that is very cool!  I think as I play more with these, I will really enjoy the uniqueness of these pens!",Actually Writes On Glass!,True,2
B000S14PFM,4.0,"I knew I was going to enjoy and get heavy use out of the clear Glaze pen, but was unsure about the opaque pens in the rest of the package. I really love the effects of embossing powder. Using embossing powder in bound art journals (I'm currently using the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ranger-Dyan-Reaveley-s-Dylusions-Creative-Journal/dp/B009MRLEJI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ranger - Dyan Reaveley's Dylusions Creative Journal</a>) is a pain. For me, embossing powder is akin to sand... it ends up everywhere.

These Glaze pens give an embossing powder-esque result. No bumps or pits or heat gun. They give a raised, glazed effect, but not quite like embossing powder. These are GLAZE and not shiny. Is there such a thing as semi-matte shiny?
 I am not disappointed by my purchase, and plan on using them as often as I can.
Overall, I am happy with them.

Pro Tip: Porous surfaces, like regular cardstock for example, absorb most of the ink, so you will get a more 'true' effect using something non-porous-ish. I did test them out on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ranger-Inks-Inkssentials-Specialty-Stamping-Paper-ATC-s/dp/B007I7IW62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ranger Inks Inkssentials Specialty Stamping Paper ATC's</a>&nbsp;and got a more favorable result.

B000S14PFM,5.0,I just ordered more of the clear glaze pens after seeing how beautifully the one from this set worked.  I am very pleased with this set.  My only complaint is that I wish they came in more colors :),Priceless,True,
B000S14PFM,5.0,"PROS:  The Sakura Gel Glaze Pens are great for pen and ink drawing. Once you get them started, the ink flows fluidly, but you do need to give them just a bit more drying time.  Because they are glazes they give a transparent and stained glass effect, with an embossed image that looks wet even after the ink is dry.  I love using the Sakura glazes to color my ink drawings and paper crafts.  Also, their transparency makes it easy to use over pigment ink, such as Copic Multiliner pen or Pilot Precise V5 RT (RT means it's retractable).

CONS: The colors are limited.

SOLUTION IF YOU HAVE A GEL PEN THAT WON'T WORK:  With the cap on, submerse the gel pen in a container of hot water.  To keep the pen from floating, I place something heavier on top of the pen to keep it submersed.  This has gotten the ink to flow with most of my duds.  Some pens had to be left submersed longer than others anywhere from a day to a week or longer.  Check from time to time,  then keep changing the water until the pen works.

REGARDING CUSTOMER SERVICE:  A few years ago I called the company to ask if they knew of a way to get a dud to work and I was told that there wasn't but they would be happy to replace any non-working pen.  So happy they were willing to stand by their product, however I kept searching the internet until I found the solution I'm sharing with you.

The work nicely on regular paper but on ""wax-like"" paper you really get the full effect.  I will add that these pens are NOT for writing.

B000S14PFM,5.0,"I have been using Gelly Rolls for years but this Glaze pen set from Sakura is new to me. I just got them today and used them on a very detailed drawing of 2 ballet dancers in a pas de deux.  The coloring book is made with decent quality paper, nothing fancy or coated.  They still showed the glazing, a nice enamel-like finish that raised from the page nice and glossy. I love them. The colors are bright and fun, I do think  they could have added 2 more in the green and blue families or removed a pink and added another color. Still they are awesome and I'm pretty picky about my pens.

The bad:  there is a clear pen in the set. What for exactly? I tried to get it to show or enhance other medium but it didn't work well, they might have instead focused on a white that would show on white paper, I'm sure they would have succeeded too, the glazing effect would have made it happen.

The glaze pens are good for pure color, or to put down some color and then wash them out with water (I use only 300 lb. Arches hot press paper for my artwork.)  The Gold Shadow and Silver Shadow are fun to use and very subtle when they are dry.  The moonlight, stardust and metallic pens are sparkly and SO much fun to use.

B004BNDH0M,5.0,Well it gives very good results but GROTESQUELY overpriced!,Five Stars,True,
B004BNDH0M,4.0,"Update April 17, 2015:

Not sure what other products are like, but I'd buy this one again in a heartbeat.
I have allergies, but I haven't smelled any odors with these products, but I've also been very careful.
I don't think that anyone should NOT buy this because of the warnings.  They are there for their purpose and oxidizers ARE dangerous.
One thing I have found is that you need to put on a rather thin layer of the actual metal fluid.
Then just play with the application of the oxidizer.  Make sure you use plenty of the latter though, and if you want a build up,
finish a layer and then place another.  With a thick layer of the iron put down, the oxidizer has to work extra hard to make it all rust.
It's worth the lack of waiting to be patient and put down thin layer after thin layer.  You can get some surprising effects with this.
And you really can't ruin anything by applying too much oxidizer.  It's easier to use than you'd think, and quite forgiving.
READ UP ON APPLICATIONS BY REVIEWERS, as the packaging doesn't tell you anything.
Also, DO NOT USE THE SAME BRUSH for both bottles.  Make sure you clean the brush for the oxidizer too, you don't want to
bring iron into the oxidizing fluid.  Another great reason to be patient and put down thin layers.  Cover completely with the oxidizer.

I've had success on cardboard flutes, (painted AND clearcoated no less), as well as metal and different model plastic pieces.

Original:
So far so good.  I've read a lot of reviews about this one, AND others.  Ultimately this arrived from Blick's Art Supplies, and I've had decent luck with them so far.

I was skeptical at first, but this is a real trial and error thing.  I'm using this for modeling a diorama, and was pleasantly surprised
at how it turned a piece of cardboard into a genuinely rusted article.  I haven't loaded up on the layers yet, but am planning on doing so soon.
I did a treatment on a plastic barn roof too, and with some practice and good buildup, it's going to look fantastic.

They have a lot of warnings on the box, I mean you ARE essentially breathing something that makes metal shavings rust almost before your eyes, so I'd be careful.  But I didn't have the overwhelming fumes that I was concerned with.  And as always, one should be gloved and have eye protection.  The fear wasn't necessary, but more practice is.  I think this is probably an excellent product.  I see more of them all the time.

Be cautious and careful, but practice a lot, put on lots of the metal fluid (this bit has definitely changed since initial use, and I may have meant to say ""oxidizer"" instead), and vary your application time of the oxidizer, with repeated apps, and see how it works for you.  Looking forward to practicing a lot more!","So far, so fun! With update:  Good stuff.",True,6

The stackable format is really nice and preferable to a circle cutter apparatus which is clumsy to use.  The thinlits go through the Cuttlebug nicely, but sometimes you do have to maneuver the cut out paper to get it to disengage from the Sizzlit.  Occasionally it doesn't cut all the way through, but for me it's not a big deal with all the paper on hand.

B005WTHYGM,5.0,"The grip feels nice & secure and its very simple to change blades.  Nice little craft knife, its very handy!",Sharp & easy to use,False,
B005WTHYGM,5.0,"As an artist, I was anxious to try out this product.  It is very precise and professional.  The soft-grip handle is easy to hold for long periods (and easy to spot on the work table as it's bright pink.)  The interchangeable blades are easy to swap out.  Being titanium, I expect they will last as long as advertised.",Quality product,False,
B005WTHYGM,4.0,"I was really looking forward to having this new hobby knife because sometimes the exacto type knife has such a small gripping area, that my fingers get sore.  This is a great substitution, but sometimes the grip is a touch too big and the ratio of pressure to hold the handle gets to my fingers in another way.  It does not hurt my wrists like using the smaller one does though, so I guess that is a good thing.

I really love the seam ripper- it works beautifully for undoing seams, but especially those that are serged.  The button hole cutter blade is nice but you have to have something you can use the blade on so you can control the knife like a self healing board to lay down the item and support the buttonhole you are cutting.

The regular blade works well for most jobs but the rounded and fine detail works okay if you are not doing really heavy duty cutting.  Lighter papers or fabrics work best with those- heavier things gave me a bit of a challenge.

I like the little case for the blades, but you have to make sure you have a specific drawer or case to keep them in as it is small, clear and easy to misplace.  I have a small plastic bin I keep in my sewing drawer so I don't have needles and stuff flying around.  The blades fit well in there.

Despite the grip being challenging occasionally for me, I do like this knife and the variety of blades it comes with.  It is versatile and useful, especially in sewing too which is something you don't tend to think about with this type of knife.

I also do love the pink color- it makes this knife easier to find than just a metal toned one.","Handle a Bit Challenging At Times, But Nice Blades",False,
B005WTHYGM,4.0,"This is a good knife with some nice features. The handle is comfortable and provides a cushioned, sure grip. The blades are sharp and I like the titanium coating. Since they are steel core, there is no appreciable difference in weight. I will note that the edges of the blades appear slightly less well finished when compared to some of my older X-ACTO blades. I have not done extensive work with these so it's unclear exactly how long these will stay sharp compared to stainless steel blades. The blade selection is good. My blades had a light oil coating on them.

I don't care for the blade cover. It seems too easy to slip and cut a finger when pulling it off or putting it back on. Also, the jaws seem a little basic. I prefer the four jaw type to better hold the blade. It seems the split jaw might not clamp down as well after heavy use. It is nice to have a lifetime warranty on this product.",Well-balanced knife,False,
B005WTHYGM,5.0,"I like Westcott's titanium bonded products for duct tape crafting because the adhesive doesn't stick to it and cause building up. These blades are no exception.
The body:
It's pink, and I do like the color pink. The grip is a soft rubbery material that's thick enough to be comfortable to grip and angled for finger placement. It cleans up easily and holds the blades securely. Standard twist to release and replace blades.

The blades:
You get several blades in a plastic container. If I have any gripe it's how small the container is but that's a complaint with any craft knife blades. In my perfect world, there is a way other than using a rubber band to keep the knife body and blades together between uses so the small containers don't get lost in the box I keep my cutting things in.
There is a standard blade- this is the blade everyone is used to in a hobby knife. Titanium bonded so it's white instead of silver, and it handles gluey and sticky things better than steel.
Curved blade- this one has a rounded end, and it's meant to cut curves. It works better than the standard blade for cutting curves, and I tried it on one of my more intricate things, it doesn't do well with super fine cuts, but for long, sweeping curves, it works well.
Detail blade- this tiny blade gets right into small areas very well to nick away little pieces of material
Seam ripper- another curved blade, this one is fine with a longer edge to slip into seams and cut the threads. It worked great on a pair of thrifted, torn leather pants I was deconstructing for the leather. I think it might be trickier on a cotton or fine fabric.
Button hole- shaped like a chisel, this one cuts straight lines for button holes and other things you need a straight cut for in the middle of material. It's very exact, just line up the blade with the cut you want to make, and apply pressure. Repeat across the length of the cut rather than drawing it down the cut and you'll get a very neat, perfect slit where you want it.

Because I don't like messing with changing blades, I plan to pick up 2 more to keep my most used blades on hand- that would be the standard, the button hole blade, and the detail blade. Then I'll only need to pause to switch out if I need one of the other 2 blades. Works great for my paper crafts and tape crafts. I've already said why I like them for tape. On paper, they cut clean, and if I'm cutting through pages that still have wet glue on them, the glue wipes right off.","Handy, comfortable and works well with tape",False,
B005WTHYGM,4.0,"I am always crafting something or another, and was excited to try this cushioned hobby knife.

The cushioning on the handle makes for a more comfortable cut, although I'm not overly fond of the edging/shaping on the top of the knife where your fingers lay, not a comfortable fit for me.

I like the the knife comes with 5 different tips which are enclosed in a small case, which is easy to lose, but hopefully that won't happen!

The blades are very sharp and I have been able to make very nice, clean cuts, however, the cover on this knife could be designed a little better, the top is curved/rounded so if you're not careful your blade will hit the top when you place the cover on the knife.

Really no serious complaints, would be nice to see this little knife in a variety of colors!","Sharp, Handy Knife",False,
B005WTHYGM,5.0,"This hobby knife is attractive, comfortable, and can cut through a stack of paper without any problem.  I did a comparison test and cut through the pages of a magazine.  My old knife cut through 4 pages of the magazine and the Westcott Titanium blade cut through 14.  What a big difference!

The hobby knife is encased in a soft cushion grip that is very comfortable.  This cushion helps reduce hand fatigue when cutting lots of paper or fabric.  The pink and purple colors are kind of girly, but I did find an yellow/gray color combo on the Westcott website.

On the Westcott website I also found replacement blades for just the Straight Line blade.  I really don't have a use for some of the specialty blades (button hole, seam ripper), and I was worried that I would have to buy the set of 5 assorted blades just to get the one I needed.  But that is not the case, you can buy just the straight line blades.

So this is a great hobby knife if your craft requires precise or repetitive cuts.","Very Sharp, cuts through 14 pieces of paper at once",False,
B006U9CN8W,5.0,"I'm using this to write my name on all the stuff I'm taking to a quilting workshop.

B006U9CN8W,4.0,Good product.,Four Stars,True,
B006U9CN8W,5.0,"I read the other reviews for this thing and I was a little hesitant. . But, I went ahead and got it to see if it would work. And I love it, honestly.

It's not going to run a glass etching business, let's just get that out right now. . And it's not a tool that will go for hours and hours or even 25 minutes in a single setting . It will, however, provide the fine etching tip you need to get in and touch up those tight areas you can't get with your dremel.

What I found this to be the most useful at is adding just a little bit more detail on your etching. Since it's such a fine tip, it's going to look different than your dremel. So, for instance if you do a leaf, take this after your sand etching or your dremel and add just a few highlights here and there to make the leaf pop. Or if there's an area that's just blending in, outline it with this an it will pop just enough. .

So, this is more of an 'accent adding tool' than it is an engraver. . . However, if you are just engraving a rough initial on a yeti or glass or something, this would work just fine for that as well. . So, just think small and fine detail and you have a good product.",Great for small details.,True,
B006U9CN8W,4.0,"I'm an artist, and work with mirrors. I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to sign my work, in a way that won't detract from the image. I finally decided that engraving my itials on the mirror, would  suffice. The problem was deciding on the type of tool to create the engraving.

This engraver works, kind of. It actually does more etching, than engraving. It's not very visible on my mirrors, but works in a pinch. I think it would work better on metals,and plastics, but keep in mind it's just a battery operated tool. I'm giving it 4 stars. It works, but isn't super impressive.",Ok for battery operated.,True,2

B006U9CN8W,4.0,"Engravers I've tried to use in the past skipped all over the place and were difficult to control.  This one provides far better control and engraves right where I want it to engrave.  I would give it 5 stars except it only accepts one size of shank; it could be so much more versatile if it had a shank insert or variable size shank.  But it's inexpensive and gives me an idea of what to look for in a step up.
One thing I really like is the dead-man button.  If you lose control of this it instantly turns off.  At first I didn't think I'd like having to hold the button down all the time, but it's a very light press to make it work, it's easy to hold, and if you get tired of holding the button it's probably time to give the tip a heat-rest.  So it works all the way around.

B007C7X524,5.0,"I purchased the pea shoot color craft paint, which is a very nice mellow green, primarily because it was on sale for $1.37.  Martha Stewart craft products generally cost a little more than the other brands I use but they are always excellent quality and I love to pick them up on sale.

I used it to paint an old wooden wall shelf that had an outdated cow picture on it and then I decoupaged some colorful birds and it turned out very nice.

I also used it as the base paint for the altered bottle I created with decoupage and mixed media.

I am using the remaining paint for a multi-colored night stand makeover that I am working on.  I will post a photo of that whenever the project is finished.

In order to give the paint more depth, I mix my own chalk paint by adding diatomaceous earth and a little water and stirring well.  This works great on wood or glass.  Sometimes I seal it with an acrylic spray sealer.

B009CFU48W,5.0,"I do a lot of crochet and some knitting and I am always on the look out for handy tools.  One of the things I dread is weaving in ends (especially when I have a lot of motifs to join together.)  It is my least favorite part of the project.  It is even worse when I am working with finicky yarns and threads that don't want to easily fit in the eye of my metal weaving needles.

I purchased this set of needles in hopes that it would make the process easier  and it does.  I really like being able to easily get my yarn into the eye, which is essentially the entire needle minus the point.

Weaving is fairly easy too as long as I am working with a size 3 or above weight.  Smaller than that and I've found that using my metal needles works best for me. I just didn't care for trying to force the plastic needle through tiny stitches. As I generally work with bulkier yarn, this isn't much of an issue for me.

That one was enough to make me a convert, though.  It is incredibly easy to ""thread"" these because of the long split in the middle, and the ends are plenty pointy enough to make weaving in your ends much easier.  The downside other than the obvious way that your yarn falls out somewhat often is that they break a bit easily.

B009CFU48W,5.0,"If you don't have one of these packs in your crochet, or knitting supplies, then you are missing a great tool.  We can't always have the loose ends as long as we wish and when they are shorter than the needle you have a real problem, Not so with this nifty little gadget, spreads to make getting the yarn into it easy and the hole goes all the way from one end to the other so going through a few stitches and turning is as easy as going one thread over and putting the point that just came out, right back into the threads.","double the points, half the trouble",True,6
B009CFU48W,4.0,"I've seen a little bit of confusion on crochet boards regarding these, so to quickly explain them: They are just regular plastic yarn needles, but the eye (the part you put the yarn through) runs the whole length of the needle. They're used just like any other plastic needle.

The length of the eye helps you thread it (particularly if you're shaky or have bad eyesight) but also helps you weave in short ends (your ends don't need to be particularly long for easy weaving in).

These needles are the most essential part of my crochet kit (...after the yarn and hooks of course ;) - in projects that require a million ends to be woven in, these cut the time (and the length of the wasted yarn ends) in half. More than half.

I'm not happy paying so much for needles BUT it's more than worth it considering there are no other needles like this. I wish they came with a carrying case, even just a tiny little plastic holder to keep them together... still, I'll keep buying them when I need new ones and I always still recommend them to any crocheter or knitter.

I've had these needles several months now and added a star to my original 3-star rating. I HATE weaving in ends, and the design of these needles really does make it easier and quicker.

6 plastic rectangles about 1inchx1.33inch (extra box dividers, ty H Kohen!)
4 end protectors- 2 green medium, 1 green 1 pink large

These are just really handy to have around, and i find myself reaching for them more often than most.

This die set is no exception.  The design is lovely -- the rectangle frame fits exactly on an A2 card (4.25"" x 5.5"").  You can use it with or without the oval cutting die (used with the oval, it produces a frame with an oval opening; without the oval die, you get a rectangular shaped lacy ""doily"" with a solid ""middle"").

The set also includes an oval label, a large-ish lacy corner piece, and an accent piece that could be used by itself or in multiples to make a ""chain.""  So far, I've used the frame (without the oval cutout), the oval in a contrasting color layered on top of the rectangular frame, and the label.  They cut nicely -- for these detailed dies, I use a piece of waxed paper between the die and the card stock (I use these:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norpro-3403-Square-Wax-Papers-250-Piece/dp/B005G4L5D6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norpro 3403 Square Wax Papers, 250-Piece</a>&nbsp;only because they're already pre-cut to the right size for my die cutting machine).

Be careful not to tap/push it too hard to get the paint into the tip of the marker as it'll only cause you problems in the form of excess ink flow when you begin to use it - better to have to shake and tap a bit more than to end up with a ""swoosh"" of paint coming out too fast and causing an excess flood of ink result in a blob of paint that you didn't want to occur!",Great Multi-Surface Marker,True,

B00FLJIMYG,4.0,"If you have not used these Fine Point Paint Markers [Set of 3] Color: White, here is an introduction to this handy pen.  When they come they are usually tightly wrapped and sealed with a plastic cover. Cut around the removable lid and it comes right off with a pull.  The contents needs to be shaken, like a paint spray can and when doing so you can hear the bead inside rattle.  After a few shakes, don't despair if it doesn't mark.  You need to push the tip until it unseats from its mounting seal.  This will start a flow of ink onto (into) the tip and you may begin using the pen.  It will mark on plastic, metal or most solid surfaces.  Not really all that great for wood, but it will paint paper.  They last through a pretty good amount of use and are permanent.  Goo Gone will take them off.  I ordered the White to mark voltage and amperages on my assortment of wall wart transformers I have accumulated, for easier identification.  So far about 20 and they dried quickly.  After that I had some sinkers, for fishing, of different weights, which are stamped into the bottom.  I inked/painted these stamped numbers for easy reading in low light.  Nice.  In general, there are numerous uses for a white, black or colored use and I like them their versatility.

B00MQUOX46,5.0,"Many years ago, I used to amuse myself copying and re-interpreting paintings I admired.  Then life got so busy that my oil paints got packed away.  Just recently I dug up my remaining supplies and found them sadly lacking.  By some happy coincidence, Daveliou, a specialist manufacturer of art supplies, asked me to try out and review some of his new products.  I am delighted to say that the art supplies I received are of the best quality and perfectly suitable for both beginners and established painters.

This set of 24 assorted paintbrushes, housed in a lovely purpose-made canvas holder, would make a fantastic gift for a budding painter, or for someone like me, who is taking up painting again after a long break.  The assortment includes all the basic brush shapes (flat, round, angle, filbert and fan) in the most popular sizes from 2 to 12, in four materials: pony, camel, nylon and bristle.  There is everything you need whatever your medium (oils, acrylics or watercolours).

The canvas carrier has 24 pockets sewn to precisely accommodate the brushes supplied.  A fold-down flap protects the tips and can be secured with Velcro tabs, after which you roll the whole thing up and tie it with the attached double string.  What an excellent idea!  My previous arrangement of dropping the brushes bristle side up in an old coffee can was okay for the drying period and for short-term storage but useless for carrying my supplies any distance.  Invariably, something would fall and go missing.  Boxes and plastic bags were messy and destructive, so this tidy and organized solution is one that makes a lot of sense.

Daveliou sell a similar paintbrush carrier minus the paintbrushes.  It is very similar in materials and construction, except that the 24 slots are of different sizes, which is very convenient if you like to use very large paintbrushes and palette knives with their bigger handles, as the 8 central pockets are quite a lot bigger than those in this holder.

Apart from the clever design, this paintbrush carrier is quite beautiful, made of sturdy but supple cream-coloured canvas, nicely finished with matching canvas binding and stamped with the distinctive Daveliou lion logo.  As a bonus, the fabric is washable.  In use, the brushes feel great, the wooden handles are smooth and well finished but don't appear to have been varnished.  Some of my older brushes have a thick glossy finish which invariably flakes off.  The ferrules hold the bristles tightly so that there is no shedding and I can paint with confidence.  This set sells for an amazingly low price and it's unbeatable value for what you get",A super assortment of paintbrushes in a beautiful canvas carrier,False,2

It is easy to use and nice bright beautiful colors. And with my holder folds up nicely so you could take them outside,  to another location or simply storing them.

B016HUI756,5.0,"This is a pack of 105 skeins of embroidery floss/thread. I enjoy cross stitch and embroidering the edges of pillow cases. The new sewing machines can do this a lot of this faster, and better, but there is something about sewing by hand that makes it more enjoyable and satisfying. I love to sew while watching TV at night.  My sewing box has a tangle of embroidery thread inside that has kept me from finishing some of my projects, so I was very happy to open up the package containing new, untangled, and very pretty floss! New floss glides so easily through the material!

I would have liked to have seen a few more different shades of blue, and a couple shades of red instead of some of the other colors. There are a few of the same colors that could have been left out so red and a few more blues could have been added, but the colors are all still very vibrant and pretty. I like that they included a bonus pack of 10 different sized needles, I'm always losing or breaking needles so they will come in handy!

B016HUI756,4.0,"I wrote an initial bad review...Was looking for a DMC substitute thread and this comes nothing close to DMC brand, BUT, when I started working with it for cross stitching, found it was pretty good quality.

CONS:
1) DMC has a gloss and shine to it and this thread did not have any (except 4 colors out of the pack were glossy so it's mixed quality threads-inconsistant). You can see from one of my pictures attached.

2) There is no # on the thread labels to determine what color reference to use. So if you use this thread, you can't refer to anything to match it unless you bring the skein in to swatch the right color. And I ordered this again and the colors are not the same.

3) Their color selection is minimal. Mostly primary colors and pastels. Not enough hued colors for degredation.

PROS:
1) The thread does not frey or break and fuzz while using it. It keeps a pretty good consistent stitch all the way through (except for lighter colors...but those colors are horrible for most brands).

2) The colors do appear more vibrant than I expected and it pops off my Aida fabric. All colors of fabric.

3) This came with enough repeat skeins so I could finish bigger project. Most mass bundles come with one skein of each color. I liked that this included more than 3 of one color.

I do wish they had more colors and # association so I could refer to it again. I attached a pic of Calvin and Hobbes cross stitch I did using only this thread. Came out pretty good!",Nothing like DMC thread BUT good!,True,10

B000S14PFM,5.0,"Absolutely love these pens. Colors are bright and can be built up, similar to an acrylic paint. For me, they work perfectly, for added accent and depth, to an image. They dry to a glossy (glaze) finish and the colors pop out.

They do take some time to dry, so be very careful, not to smear them, while working.

If you push down gently on the tip, the ink flows. It seems they are designed like this, so the ink does not flow out too heavily, with each stroke, which is something I dislike about the regular Sakura gel pens. With this one, I dot out lines and then pull the ink with the tip, to the desired space, to be filled. You need to be patient, to achieve a raised effect and wait for one layer to dry, before applying the next or it will not dry smoothly. When done properly, it is a beautiful effect.

The green is a little on the light side, but each layer creates a richer color. Three layers, will give a rich Granny apple green

But the most important thing expose your child to art, including things you don't like or understand. I know of many a parent who has been surprised by the childs perception beyond their years.

B00XCJPEB6,5.0,"Hello peeps!  I am in crafting heaven!  Seriously, I ordered this iron on vinyl by chance....it had good reviews and a very reasonable price....well let me tell you something.... if you are considering this product...you need to do yourself a favor and get it!
I cut it with my Cricut Expression.  (It's a very old machine I happened to buy at a yard sale but it is now my very favorite household tool!!) It cuts great at a 2 or 3.  You must make sure to reverse the image!
I made 20 shirts for a family reunion and weeding the intricate design was a pain in my toosh!  I can imagine how much more painful this could have been...I'm serious... this really is an easy weed vinyl.  It stretches and pulls away wonderfully!  In all 20 images I cut I only had one small issue and it was most likely because my Expression missed a cut for some reason.
When you go to apply this you'll need to be very careful because your iron needs to be on the highest setting.  Follow directions and you should do great!  All of my shirts turned out beautifully (and then we tie-dyed them!) Such a fun family reunion activity.
I will buy Kate's from here on out...such an amazing product!

B017SA9834,5.0,"I am a first time user of this type of finish for my artwork and craft projects, therefore I cannot compare this product to others. What I can do, though, is share my experience using it. My first attempt at using this with paper did not come out as smooth as I had wished. I ended up with a few wrinkles and bubbles, but I do not blame the product but my inexperience. I liked that the finish held to the foam brush well without dripping and smoothly covered the paper project. without leaving brush lines. A little bit went a long way, too.  My second attempt went much better. I did not put as much finish on it as I had the first time and also waited a bit for the finish to get a little tacky before I adhered the paper to the base, (Thank you You-tube!)
I used a brayer to smooth the paper once it was adhered to the base. I had very little wrinkling or bubbling. Clean up was very easy. The foam brushes, my hands and the brayer washed off easily with just water. I also like that his set came with both a matte and a gloss finish as well a 25 foam brushed. I can't  image me using them all unless I get  hooked on this type of craft finishing. I only have used the matte finish so far, and i like the look of it. The photos below were my fist two attempts. I used a canvas as the base for the project and colored card stock paper for the designs. I also printed the center design on card stock. I imagine it will be a different experience when I use napkins or thinner paper for a project.",Applies smoothly,True,3

B00000IURU,4.0,"I bought this tent a few years ago for my triplet nieces and nephew's 3rd birthday and they loved it! They still play with it, so it is durable. The tent is brightly colored and has handles for the kids to hold onto as they are lifting and spinning it. There is a lot kids can do with this parachute: make wind and bounce balls on the top of it as they raise it up and down, make tents/forts, drag each other around on it, and lift it and run underneath, and the kids can come up with some more fun ideas to do with it. This is really something that works best with more kids, so there is a teamwork element to it by lifting it in a synchronized way. The parachute is lots of fun on rainy days and is small enough to where you can use it indoors.

As much as the kids enjoy it, I was disappointed that the fabric was thin and I could see it easily ripping, which is why I'm giving it  4 stars, as well as that it had a strange chemical smell when I first took it out of the box.","Great Parachute, Thin Material",True,

I looked at couple different retail stores and had a hard time finding these wheels in pink.  When I did they were more expensive so I was happy to find them here on Amazon they were around $20.  They arrived quickly and my husband didn't have any issues switching out her old wheels and putting these ones on.  Wow, they made such a difference for her riding her scooter.  It was a much smoother rider and each push of her foot allowed her to go further than when her worn old wheels were on her scooter.

However the red front wheel was rubbing in plastic inside the front fork.  I had to use a utility knife to cut away some of the plastic inside the front fork.

ABEC 5 are what are found on most skateboards and scooters in the US.  Some models from China are rated ABEC 3 which are to be avoided.

It is soft and mostly harmless to the young and old alike.  It is fairly ambidextrous and easy to get a reasonable flight out of.  Generally, it is a great entry-level boomerang, and a lot of fun.

Turns out, they not only work but they don't really hurt when you try to catch them, and you can easily throw two at once. Also, sometimes the boomerang comes back and lands softly like a ""UFO"" when the wind is right and with enough spin. When this happens it looks like a circular hole in the middle when looking up at it, and you can just stick your arm in there to catch it if you can't otherwise or just for more fun. When throwing two at once, all you need to do is grip a little tighter and ""spoon"" them together and they usually stick within 10 feet of each other. These are not too difficult to learn, I was able to in just a couple hours of practice with no instruction or tips other than what's printed on top of each one.

A couple things it doesn't say on top...

1) When there's wind, simply make sure the wind is hitting your left side (90 degrees from wind direction). Unless of course you are throwing left-handed then the wind should be coming from the right. That way the wind helps it make the full 360 degrees so you can catch it before it starts to make an ""S"" maneuver away from the throwing location.

2) Two can easily be thrown at once, and they usually stick close together and land nearby each other if thrown correctly.

3) You can sometimes catch it easily with any type of long object at least 4"" or thinner, such as a bat, golf club or even your arm",Video Demonstrations. Very fun and totaly worth the money. Be sure to buy at least two of them.,True,14

B00009KWUH,4.0,"I bought this boomerang because I bought one of the Aerobie Frisbee and it flies like crazy. My kids and I have a lot of fun playing with the Frisbee.

The boomerang was packed in a small box (from Amazon) and one of the tips was bent and since is rubber it took a while to straight it up. At the beginning the boomerang sometimes did U-turns, landing several feet to my left hand side, other times it just hit the ground flying in a straight line. My wife was laughing and telling me to return it. I didn't want to give up and I took it to the park the next day and I saw a guy with several boomerangs (not Aerobie boomerangs). I asked him if he can figure how to make the Aerobie boomerang flying back. After throwing it a few times the boomerang did the same, U-turns only. Then he took a look at it and bent the front part (thin part) of the tips up, threw it in a ""2 o'clock"" position and in the first try, the boomerang came back to his hands. I did the same thing and after a few throws it came back to my hands.

The Aerobie boomerang really flies back to you but it takes patience and practice. I really like it.

The instructions on all my wooden boomerangs warn that at a certain angle, they will climb to their last flight and dive to the ground causing them to break. This one has hit the ground like that with no damage. It is best to throw it in a big, wide open field, as it flies quite far with minimal effort, and as it is fairly soft, it may be best to avoid direct impact with surfaces hard, rough or sharp.",Excellent,True,
B00009KWUH,5.0,"many angles to throw.

Can throw like frisbee and it will go straight for a long time but you have to throw it more precisely than a regular frisbee.

B000KFZ2K8,5.0,"Having lifted weights for over 20 years, I have gone through quite a bit of different accessories and aids, and these are definitely the best lifting straps I've found in many years.

Their unique magic is in the rubber strips which really do make these nylon straps STICK to whatever bar you're using: pull-up bar, lat-machine bar, dumbbells, or barbells.  Wonderful, wonderful grip.

My only complaint is that there is no extra padding for the part of the strap that wraps around your wrists, unlike with the other Harbinger lifting strap, which regrettably does not have the rubber strips.

Whenever Harbinger combines both features into a single strap, they will have achieved absolute perfection!

ESSENTIAL USAGE TIP: do *not* wrap the part of the strap that goes around the bar on top of itself, it will be too big and cause the kinds of complaints that the other (unskilled) reviewers are complaining about.

Better than no straps, but after using them for about a week it appears that the rubber grip feature may also be the downfall of these straps. The rubber grips make it harder to get a really tight wrap around the bar, particularly on the hand that gets wrapped last. Over the week I have been using them, this seems to have improved, though I'm not sure if it's because the nylon is slightly less stiff or my strap wrapping technique has begun to accommodate these.","rubberized grip is cool feature, but also difficult to use",True,

Pros:
They are much more comfortable than previous Versions
The strap comes from the center and not the sides so it doesn't hurt you wrist.
Increased grip strength
Rubber middle strip makes a big difference and clamps onto the bar

Cons:
A little more expensive than previous versions from this company.

These are good if you have small wrist like me (Damn you Genetics!) and using regular non padded straps or even regular padded straps hurt you. You wear these likes cuffs and the amount of cushion it has is great, I suggest cutting them to size since the strap is very long and usually fits around the bar for me 3 times (I prefer having long straps).

B000KFZ2K8,5.0,"Very comfortable straps. There is a padding built in the inside of the strap.

B000LH8JAU,4.0,"This Phantom Aquatics Mask and Dry Snorkel set came in a nice quality reusable velcro-topped carry bag w handle, which was a little too tight a fit for ease of use during an outing, but which conveniently kept everything together and not flopping around for storage. The soft plastic/rubbery portions of the mask and mouthpiece are extremely flexible and conformed to my face comfortably, and the side adjustments made the straps fairly easy to tighten around my head. I didn't have any problems with slippage of the large and webbed back portion of the mask off my wet hair, nor did the rubbery material pull on my hair in a painful manner, which had been a problem for me in the past w some other masks.

The only issue I had was that the nose portion did not make a full watertight seal, and i had some light leakage with water slowly entering the lower part of my mask over time while using this for about 3 hours-- i needed to lift up the bottom part and drain the water maybe every 10 min or so, which wasn't too bad, but not the best. On the other hand, the field of vision from the goggles was broad and clear, and I didn't experience any fogging (probably cuz i was lifting the mask for draining). Also, the snorkel itself was indeed dry, and normal dunking and splashing around did not cause any water to enter the tubing, nor did I have any breathing blockages. The airflow was good, and I thought this set was worth it, even just for the snorkel itself. I think it's hard to get a perfect fit for a mask, and you just have to try some out.

B000LH8JAU,4.0,"This fits well with a good seal.  The mask does fog up easily though.  If you buy this, you might want to buy some anti-fog spray to go with it.  That helps.  The snorkel is flexible and clips to the mask.  Once clipped it stays in place well.  The fact that it is flexible means that it can bop you in the head just a bit, but it's also buoyant in the water.  It is a dry snorkel, which all of us here like but that's a matter of preference.  We had a funny episode with a visiting teen trying it out in the pool thinking that meant he could go to the bottom and take a deep breath.  No, it doesn't work like that, ha, but it will keep water out if you accidentally get it under water for a bit.  If you take a deep breath though, expect to get a bunch of water in.  It's also a bit bulkier than other snorkels, but this one has a very comfortable bite that makes up for that.

The straps around the mask are silicon and easy to adjust.  The straps on this mask are great.  I like the mask, and it has great visibility - when it isn't fogged up.  The lenses are glass though and super clear.  Anti-fog spray fixes the fog problem but has to be bought separately.

Recommended for light use, for swimming pools.  There are certainly better masks out there that don't fog.  This one may or may not be pleasant for you.  My guys have bigger, boxier heads and it seals well all the time for them.  My head is smaller and round, and occasionally I get a bit of water in at the bottom where the nose is, on this one.  I vacillate between 3-4 stars, but it's a very affordable set with some nice features so I'll go with a 4.","With the addition of some anti-fog spray, this is a great mask/dry snorkel set",False,
B000LH8JAU,5.0,"I started out getting just the Phantom snorkel and liked it so much I now have this complete set of snorkel and mask. I've been unable as yet to fully test its splash resistance. It does keep nearly all water out of the tube when submerged very well. Any which does get in, will be blown out of the valve near the mouth piece when you surface again. I have only used it up to this point in a pool environment. I don't do a great deal of outdoor swimming here in Seattle until Summer time. Actually I don't do any outdoor swimming until Summer time. Puget Sound stays too cold all of the time, and the lakes around us are cold until mid Summer, and there are not a great many waves of any consequence which are going to hit you in a swimming pool. So, tests of splash resistance will need to wait for awhile. I I will be able to get some very good use with it on our trip to Spain in September.

My favorite feature of the snorkel is the quick release clip. I it's such a small thing, but it is such a convenience. You are able to quickly remove the  the tube from your face mask strap. It takes less than a second, OK, maybe two if your hands are slippery. With the old masks I've had,  it took some time to separate those masks from the attached snorkel, and in most cases I found it simply easier to just leave it attached when I put the equipment away. I enjoy now being able to separate them because it makes it easier to carefully store them, and there is less wear and tear on both devices.

Because of the flexible lower portion of the device, which includes the mouthpiece and the flexible tubing that connects to the main tube, you do get a little more movement when swimming. I didn't find it annoying, but a little different than what I'm used to. All my others have been basic, solid, one piece tubes. I'm very willing to put up with this very minor concern, because the other features far outweigh it in importance. Further more, I didn't even notice the additional movement after the first couple of uses.

I've never had a good comfortable dive mask until I got this one. I always had problems with my nose on the others which were all oval shaped single lens masks. They never felt right, and weren't comfortable. They just didn't fit as well as this one, and my nose was always banged up against the glass, which also caused it to fog more often. This one is so comfortable, and I have very little problems with leaks. The oval shape masks always felt as though I was looking through a tunnel, and for a very obvious reason of course. I was. This one gives me much less of the tunnel feeling, and the change is very welcome.

My favorite technique for reducing/removing fog problems in my dive mask is to use Johnsons Baby Shampoo, and I'm continuing the practice with this new one. I wash the lens, then apply a small amount of Johnsons Baby Shampoo with my fingers to the lens. Obviously the inside of the lens. Wouldn't do a whole lot of good if you put it on the outside of the lens. The ocean pretty much takes care of any fog on the outside. After you smear it all over the lens, gently rinse it off. Don't use high pressure water. You don't want to remove every trace of it, because a little of the baby shampoo needs to coat the lens to keep the fog off it. So, just rinse it rather gently, and then just let it dry. Works awesome. Other shampoo would probably work, but Johnsons Baby Shampoo will not irritate your eyes, even if you get some water in your mask. For those of you who want to continue using your own special anti fog ""spit"" after you get this new one, go ahead, I don't care, but I can assure, you spit can't possibly work as well, however, I will agree with you, it is very economical. If you don't want to use Baby Shampoo, or spit, Amazon has a great product which will do the job, called M Essentials Sea Gold Anti-Fog Gel for Dive Masks.

B000LH8JAU,4.0,"Ive used a mask and snorkel a few times but Im not a highly experienced skin diver so please see this review in that context.

The Phantom Aquatics set is made of very lightweight black material which has a high gloss finish very similar to current electronics. The material of the mask is more flexible and comfortable than any other mask Ive ever used. The seal is likewise better than masks Ive used in the past. I got mask fogging when out of the water, but not when submerged in water roughly 80F and air of similar temperature. I think Im going to get some anti-fog spray or whatever for the mask because it was troublesome enough on a few occasions for me to remove the mask and give it a wash to clear it.

The snorkel has a ball check valve which seals it as soon as you submerge. The check valve worked instantly and perfectly. I got no leakage to speak of in the snorkel while diving. The snorkels total length is significantly greater than straight pipe ones Ive used before. While the no water in the tube and no blow out needed are nice changes, I found myself giving a good blow out of habit when I came up for air.

I also noted a certain lack of wind while swimming on the surface using the snorkel for breathing and keeping face down which is a way I often proceed while mask, snorkel and fins equipped. I attribute this to the length of the snorkel which would retain more CO2 than the much shorter straight tube snorkels. This caused me to take deep breaths and exhale strongly to remove as much CO2 as possible from the tube.

I like the mask enormously and think it a five star device. Im skeptical of the snorkel since water in the tube doesnt bother me. The valve works perfectly but the tube length has a bit of a disadvantage to my use of skimming over the surface for much of my time in the water. I can see that  those who don't wish to contend with water in the tube after every dive would find this a boon.

So like so many things, its you pay your money and take your choice.",Lighter Weight With Valve,False,
B000LH8JAU,4.0,"This inexpensive snorkeling kit includes a mask, snorkel and plastic carry bag with velcro closure. It is exactly the same as many other mask and snorkel offerings here (they're all made in China, most likely at the same factory or in the same factory complex), but is less expensive because it does not include a set of fins - a good thing, in my opinion, which you can take at face value (i am certified for open-water scuba).

Why? Because unless you're able to actually try on a pair of fins - or for that matter, a snorkel or dive mask - fit and finish may vary. A pair of fins that are either too tight or too loose can make even a short outing in the water uncomfortable in a short time and make even cause blisters or other harm.

On the other hand, many masks are easily adjustable, and a snorkel will usually work for many different folks regardless of age or sex (children's sets of course, require specifically smaller masks and snorkels).

This kit's mask is cheaply made, but works. It should function well for at least a season or two if properly cared for. The head strap is wide, adjustable, and unless you're The Elephant Man, should fit your head. It kept a decent seal during a half hour of use in a dive pool - no snorkeling mask provides a perfect seal, btw.

Tips on Use:

1. there should be no complaints about fogging: Fogging is easily managed by using a tiny swab of baby shampoo on the inside of each lens, rubbed thoroughly in, then left to dry. As long as your mask doesn't flood, you won't get fogging - especially if you don't breathe through your nose.

2. i'm taking off a star because the included snorkel is described as 'dry' - this is not entirely true, because there is also a purge valve in the lower portion of the snorkel to rid water entry. A one-way valve allows you to exhale to expunge the collected water. This snorkel is actually 'semi-dry,' as the top valve could still let in some water. That said, this snorkel kept water out during numerous shallow (8-foot) dives. After a half hour of activity there was no water collected in the lower portion of the snorkel - had there been, it can be easily purged using the valve and an exhale.

You can avoid jaw ache by alternating holding the mouthpiece using your teeth or your lips - you don't need to grip the piece tightly - this will quickly induce pain in your muscles. Just breathe and hold with a light touch and you'll have a much better time.

3. practice, practice, practice... do *not* just open this package while on vacation and expect to have a good time right away... you need to know your gear and how to adjust it for maximum comfort and safety... practice pool side or from the beach, not just open water!

4. keep your gear clean and replace broken or worn-out parts... one more negative about this kit is that the snorkel mouthpiece is large - not for a child! - and it appears there are no brand replacements available - and not even a single sheet of instructions, contact info, or warranty or other information was included in the bag. The included bag is a bonus, but it is not a mesh bag - after rinsing your mask and snorkel, you'll need to let them dry out or you will get mold and mildew on your gear. A mesh bag would have been much better for this gear - but the plastic will keep dirt and dust out during storage.

all in all, not a bad kit - but certainly not worth its msrp - good at less than a Jefferson though",a few tips for inexpensive aquatic fun,False,

B000LH8JAU,5.0,"Well made snorkeling set, I'm quite impressed with this diving mask and snorkel set. The mask is heavy duty with tempered glass lenses and suctions well to the face to keep water out thanks to amazing soft silicone. The mask also gives you good range visibility as you explore. They did fog up a bit, but this may have been because the water was cool and the air was warm. Either way, I'm not sure how this could be avoided. I did the old spit in the googles trick and it seemed to help.

The snorkel was also great. I've used other snorkel sets before but you always have to be careful not to go too deep because you'll be sucking in water when you take a breath. That is no the case with this snorkel. If the top of the snorkel dips below the water's surface, an internal mechanism stops the flow through the tube so you can't get air, but you also won't suck in a bunch of water. The snorkel can attach right to the mask for convenience. It also has a lower drain so any water that does get in will just run right out the bottom and if you exhale hard, the used air will go out of the bottom.

Both pieces come in a nice bag with a handle and velcro flap so it's easy to tote the set around with you.

Overall, I'm very pleased with this set and would recommend to others (especially at this lower price point).

B000LH8JAU,4.0,"I have a tiny noggin... wear child-sized hats and sunglasses even.  However my hubby can't even purchase normal hats to fit his giant head, and sunglasses are always on the small side for him.  I was nervous about ordering snorkel masks online without ability to try the fit, but finding them in stores during a Colorado winter isn't something that is going to happen.

Other reviewers had said they fit small and large, and I found this to be very true.  I ordered two and this same mask size worked for both of us.  Hubby wished it was a *tiny* bit bigger and I wished mine was a *tiny* bit smaller, but I doubt we could have gotten any better fit without a VERY expensive custom fit.

I was also impressed on day 1 that the mask didn't seem to fog up as much as I feared it would, but by day two of constant snorkeling, it was fogging quite a bit more and it is not the easiest of masks to lift away from your face and wipe fog away.  (Really the only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5)

The float valve or whatever it is in the breathing tube worked very well and even when diving or a wave went over us. We had very little water to blow out of the tube.

B000MJKMHK,5.0,My boat has low gunnels (sides) and I've had a repeated problem with the back corner of the boat sliding under the dock and getting pounded by the underside of the dock.  I bought one of these a couple months ago to see if it would help with that problem.  I was docking last weekend and had this fender in place in the back.  The tide was very low and the wind was pretty high and the back of the boat slid under the dock as I was securing the lines.  I was very pleased to see that the top of this fender absorbed all of the impact.  I'd recommend this fender for low freeboard boats.,Works well on low-gunnel boats,True,2

B000MJKMHK,4.0,I recently purchased two of these fenders because my new Ranger Z118 bass boat would slip underneath some of the piers I use. This can lead to damage of the boats sides and top rail's gel coat.. The curved design saves the boat from scratches and gouges that can occur if the water is choppy. I installed Perko 1299DP0CHR Chrome Marine Fender Lock - Pack of 2 - on the inside of my boat's top rails and attached the fenders with nylon line. I plan on getting a couple more because of the design of my boat. These fenders are tough and I think they will last a long time. I'd recommend these fenders to anyone who has a low-riding designed boat.,Does the job.,True,7

The reason why is because I would like to get this ball harder, but maybe it's not designed to be THAT hard as in the smaller balls?  I don't know.  The issue I have is after I've blown it up with the white strawlike tube included, the key is to quickly take that out and put the plastic pin in place without losing air.  I'm quick, but there is still always a little loss of air, where with a bike pump, no loss of air.

B000O5MYIC,4.0,"Not having prior experience with exercise balls, I'm not sure if this review will help anyone. I got this one primarily for placing beneath my lower back to do leg exercises, and to use between my feet, and then decided it was nice for arm exercises too. I don't have any books or videos for it, so I just make up my own exercises. For support of the lower back/hips area to do leg exercises it works better when deflated a bit so as not to roll underneath you..

This ball was easy to inflate with the very cheap/flimsy pump that came with my 65cm (very large) stability ball; the pump has 2 inflator tips, and the smaller tip happens to fit in this ball. If I remember correctly, the instructions for this mini ball said to inflate it with your mouth...That would have been tough...

The pin doesn't go quite all the way into the ball, sticking out just a bit and looking like a thumb tack, which is why I'm not giving this a 5*. Not sure if it's my imagination, but the ball seems to be slowly losing air - yet I did try to remove the pin to deflate it a bit, so that is probably why, yet it requires a lot of effort to remove the pin completely.

The ball has a pleasant soft surface with a nice grip which allows you to hold it lightly with your fingers. I also like it for arm exercises and upper back stretches while holding the ball lightly.",Very nice so far,True,

B000O5MYIC,5.0,"I ordered Fitball after doing Physical Therapy with it at the physical therapy office.  I am undergoing PT for strengthening muscles after back surgery.  This 9"" ball has a great non-slip texture, it is some what coarse not just smooth plastic like the big exercise ball.  It is pleasant to touch and stays where you put it very well.

My favorite exercise with it so far is double ball abdominal lift/crunch.
  * Laying on my back and tighten your abdominal muscles and I squeeze the 9"" inch ball with my knees, while holding the larger exercise balls with my feet.
  * Then I raise the ball off the floor. To protect my lower back, I pull my bellybutton in toward my spine.
  * Then I squeeze the ball between my knees for one deep breath.
  * Return I return to the start position and repeat.

This exercise really gives a good burn!

In addition to the exercises I get at the PT office, I found additional information by googling for 'fit ball' exercises.  The ones with video are almost as good as going to the physical therapy office as you see the correct way to do the exercises. For example, Mayo clinic has a nice set.",Very pleased!

B000O5MYIC,5.0,"I purchased this ball after almost purchasing the Bender Ball and reading on here that this was the same thing, only without the DVD (which I also read was pretty worthless).

I thought my abs were in pretty good shape (recently completed a round of p90x), but this ball really made my abs sore for several days. That tells me its working!

I can still use it to transport guns, if I decide to, but so far, it's been easy enough to carry individual guns in their original hardshell cases. I have a smaller Plano case for a Zastava CZ99 and love it. I keep the gun in a gun safe at home, but carry it in the Plano case which is padlocked.

I purchased this Plano four pistol case because I had a couple of single and two pistol cases (and a couple of rifle cases) from Plano that I liked.

B000P3WPKK,5.0,Great case it's durable and plenty big.  The only drawback is that it's not waterproof but it's fine for routine range trips.

B000P3WPKK,5.0,"Great Value! I used mine to create a GoPro Camera Case for my three cameras, their chargers, three back plates, memory cards etc. The pinch block foam padding was easy to customize with a pocket knife. The only negative I've found is if you're not paying attention when you close it, there's a tendency to pinch the palm of your hand between the split handles (designed with upper and lower halves).

I will go with more of these, plus the single-pistol cases, just so I can store everything cleanly in the safe.

B000P3WPKK,5.0,"I use this for full size paintball markets I have used it for an empire mini gs, a tippmann gryphon and an ION XE with a 16 inch barrel.

I can actually fit two paintball markers in one box because of the two separate layers of foam.

Everything fits snug as well plenty of room to store batteries, squeegees, I threw a bushmasters rifle cleaning kit in there manuals for all my markers, tape, microfiber cloths.

It looks small but if you arrange everything neatly it will fit really nice and keep everything locked and secure.

Extra Canon Lens
Canon Battery Charger
Two Batteries
Canon Cleaning Kit
Multiple lens filters/polarizers

B000P3WPKK,5.0,"I bought 2 of these.  1 I use as a gun case and the other I use for my GoPros and accessories.  both uses are great.  It might be a bit big for the GoPro use, but I have a lot of accessories that go with them.  In the gun case I have my S&W Model 27-2 6"" .357 and a Ruger Mark II Target with a Scope.  I have actually put my Ruger Standard in with the others as well although it is a tight fit.  In the lower layer I have all my range gear and some ammo.

B000P3WPKK,5.0,"This is a great case, that's why it's getting four stars. I got one in which to store my LaTrax Alias. As soon as I got the custom foam pieces sorted out (by removing the necessary parts) it fit snug. My friend saw it and asked me to order him one for his microphones.

I'm glad this exists. If I can think of anything else that needs similar protection, I know where to go.",Little cheaper than you think...,True,
B000P3WPKK,5.0,I only have (3) 9mm so this is a bit overkill but hey it just means I can fit more magazines in the same box! Not the strongest I have seen but for transport to/from the range it works great.,Little big but...,True,
B000P3WPKK,4.0,"It's great.  I give it 4 stars however because I wish the clamps were a little more heavy duty, and you have to be careful that if case isn't full, I have had guns slide around inside.  The pros outweigh the cons, as carrying 4 pistols (or more depending on the size of your guns) along with extra magazines or other accessories is really convenient.",Buy it,True,

B000P3WPKK,5.0,"I was wanting something that would protect my R/C radio and not break the bank. A Pelican case would cost almost as much as the radio. I didn't want to go real cheap and lose out on protection. This Plano box fit the bill perfect! Very inexpensive, but comes with everything I needed. It has the egg crate for the bottom and top of the case and a pluck out insert. I was able to modify the pluck out insert to fit my radio and accessories perfectly.

This is a case to protect my radio to and from the field in my vehicle. I would not try to ship my radio in this case. It's not built to be man-handled, but does offer the appropriate protection I was looking for. I would definitely buy again!!!",For my Spektrum DX9 R/C Radio,True,
B000P3WPKK,5.0,"Many reviewers are putting down the quality of this case. I do not agree with them. Unless you are dropping this case from a ten story building on the concrete, this case is sturdy enough to carry anywhere. Remember that this case is not going to be checked in as luggage, or be used as a step ladder. Case can be used for many other things besides guns, you can carry electronic equipment, fragile toys or devices. Case comes with three layers of foam, the bottom layer is diced foam to customize case to your needs. You may not need all that foam, and in that case, you will have more room to carry your belongings.
A great case, for a great price. You can always pay $85 for a Pelican case, or $15 for this case. I guess the Pelican case can also be used as a step ladder.",A good deal on a very good case,True,
B000P3WPKK,5.0,Can't beat this case for the price.  I am able to fit 4 full size 1911's in it securely and without a lot of moving around.  Great case to take to range or competition.,Good case,True,

B000P3WPKK,5.0,"I purchased this box for my FlySky RC transmitter.  The pre-scored foam makes it easy to form your own configuration.  I was able to accommodate my transmitter and my field charger.  It all looks professional and it keeps everything secured.  For added convenience I glued the foam to the boX with spray adhesive once I cut everything in place.
It's not a Pelican hard case but for the price it does what I need and saved me some $$$.",Excellent,True,8
B000P3WPKK,5.0,"I use the case to carry my bass guitar wireless system. The diced-up foam layer made it easy to customize the case for two full setups, with cables. When traveling, a single tie-wrap through the lock rings pretty much guaranties that the case stays closed. I also use a TSA approved lock when I fly. For my needs, the protection from knocks and crushing is working out better than I thought I'd get...considering the price of the case. This is a great solution that is very suitable for protecting items that may occasionally be put into a high-risk situation. Of course, good judgement is the best protection.",Adequate protection and easily configurable.  This case is a BARGAIN!,True,

B000P3WPKK,4.0,"I bought this to store my TC Helicon VoiceLive 3 and it's power supply.  There are three pieces of foam. I have the two egg carton piece of foam on top and bottom of case and the straight foam cut to fit around the VL3.  The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because the plastic it is made out of isn't very thick, which makes me worry that it is easy to crack/warp.  I am a little concerned that if dropped (by accident of course) that locks will pop open (locks are plastic) or the plastic will crack.  The locks do have holes to secure it in place if it does try to come open.  It was cheap and is serving its purpose until I can build a more rugged case.","Good price, decent quality, used to protect TC Helicon Voice Live 3",True,

B000P3WPKK,5.0,I grabbed two of these when they were eleven buckos each.  They will easily hold a couple handguns and a bunch of magazines for safe secure transport.

Could very easily be used as a camera transport as well with multiple lenses.,"great case, great size, lots of uses",True,
B000P3WPKK,5.0,This case has a lot of room.  The plastic is very sturdy and for someone who just needs a case for carrying handguns to and from the range this is perfect especially for the price.  The protection inside is great also.,Great Case,True,

B000P3WPKK,4.0,"Pretty good case for everyday use.  The snaps are a little light-duty, but I did get the cheapest case that didn't look like a total waste of money.  Has a lot of foam inside, even with 2 or just 1 gun, everything stays properly in place.",Pretty good case,True,
B000P3WPKK,5.0,"As I own and have used repeatedly the next size smaller (I use to transport three pistols), this case is much bigger (as in thicker) then I expected. Easily takes in a full size 1911, a full size 9mm, a Ruger Mark III Target and a couple pocket pistols with some additional room for some magazines.  It's two layers of protection (think like a two level townhouse). Padding is very good and the hinges (for an all plastic case) work well.  You can secure the contents using a padlock.  This case is also very good for transporting camera equipment.  For $15.00, this is a terrific, well padded case.",Bigger then I expected.,True,

B000P3WPKK,5.0,"I got one of these from wally-world to use as a binocular case. It could be used for all kinds of things. I got one with the pick n pluck foam and although a solid piece you trace and cut would've been easier and form fitting, it was easy enough to get a basic shape using the squares. The top egg crate foam wouldn't stay in the lid, but a light spray of 3M adhesive solved that. The binoculars are held firmly in place and surrounded by foam. Of course you still have to be careful not to throw it around or anything. It's thin-ish plastic and I'm pretty sure it'd crack if dropped on a hard surface the right way. This isn't Samsonite by any stretch and I sure wouldn't trust it as a ""locked"" gun case, but for the cost it's cheap effective protection.",Nice cheap multi-purpose case,False,

This could conceivable hold 4 pistols, but not terribly practically without rubbing or or making it difficult to use.  The latches are kind of cheap, and my biggest complaint is that the handle is plit, and can really pinch your hands while closing or carying.  (as opposed to the gun-guard, which has a solid handle mounted on a hinge.)  For the price (1/5th that of Gun Guard), a decent enough case, but I'll end up upgrading.","Good for the price, but not ""great.""",True,

B000P3WPKK,5.0,"This is great for transporting 3 pistols, ammo, target, eye protector and ear protector to the range and back. It keeps everything secure and in one place and the lock prevents anyone from just opening it. I don't have children in the home so if I chose to keep weapons in the box between trips to the range, it serves the purpose. If I have any visitors, it will keep the curious from opening it. I like the way it is made and having two layers allows me to keep as much as I need in the case for transport. The lower level has foam that I can form for the pistols to fit inside without moving around.",Good Case,True,
B000P3WPKK,5.0,"I use this to hold a variety of EDC items from flashlights, to pens to knives.  I don't like throwing it all on my dresser and having a mess all the time, I like to know exactly where my tools are.

This is a great purchase with the foam and can be cut out to fit your gear.  I easily have 12 flashlights, 10 knifes so far, and 2 pens in here and they are all easy to keep track of, and find if needed.

I could still put a few pistols in here, because there are two layers of foam, so if I really need to I might use it for transporting to the range, but I have a good sized range bag I use for that already.",Great for storing EDC items and keeping track of pocketables.,True,

B000P3WPKK,5.0,"For the price, you cannot beat this quality! I was expecting a rather ""chincy"" item...but this is some solid hard plastic with tight snap closures on the front.

(unlike most that have a thin plastic extension of the latch and breaks quickly after opening often). Highly recommend this for work, storing items, tools, guns, etc. I took my 3 pieces of foam out since I am only storing files, but my next one I will cut out to make it my travel table work station.

When I got my case, I immediately started on re-configuring the foam to fit the stuff I wanted to carry but I made several mistakes along the way and the foam got messed up.  I contacted Plano to see if I could buy a spare set.  They, instead, had me fill out a customer service form and a couple weeks later I got ALL the foam.

No it is not an airline case,  No you can not run over it and expect it to survive,  But short of multi-million Pelican cases these work well for my purposes.  The fact that the case can be locked is also a point in its favor.  All in all worth the price.",Great at the price point!,True,
B000P3WPKK,5.0,This works great for my two handguns and magazines. I am not sure how you would fit 4. I guess if you don't customize the center piece. Great for carrying them to the range.

I use these for pistols and as a waterproof bug-out solution since I live near water.  Here is what I found:

Pros
- Sturdy
- seals tightly

B000P3WPKK,5.0,"This would be a dumb case to use for pistols as it can be cut upen with a pair of kitchen scissors or a pocket knife. I bought it to hold 6 fishing reels and if someone steals a reel it is not going to be used to kill someone.

The interior foam is stiff enough to hold moderately heavy items in place. No dividers so the entire space is available for items up to  the size of the interior of the case.

There is a tab with a hole for a padlock but it is not going to even slow down a thief or curious child for more than a couple minutes. The latches are adequate to keep the case closed even if it took a bounce in a vehicle.

This is a great case for the price but if you need to have a moderate level of security for the items you place inside you would be better served with a heavy duty Pelican or Storm case which will at least take 5 minutes to open.",Great value and well designed and constructed case - low security uses only,True,

Has egg crate foam on both sides with a center sheet of precut foam that can be used as either a ""separator"" for two sets of handguns or, by removing some of the precut sections personalize the case for a specific handgun and its accessories.  To be honest, I had already had one of these cases given to me and it was doing double... well, MORE than double... duty by holding far more than the four pistols it claims to hold.  While I would not carry more than four, two in the bottom layer and two in the top layer, pistols in it while traveling when I am simply taking guns out to the range I have wound up with as many as ten (six subcompacts, two midsized, and two large 1911-sized pistols) guns in one.  Recently myself, my oldest daughter, and her two children traveled to Texas to visit my mother.  Because we were also going to be hog hunting we each carried a carry gun for while we were there and a heavier sidearm to be used as a backup during the hunt.  All four handguns traveled without a problem, not a scratch or any kind of issues.",Inexpensive but Sturdy and easily configurable,True,
B000P3WPKK,5.0,"The Plano Four Pistol case is very good quality and functinality in the price range. This case is an inexpensive case, as compared with some brands that are much more expensive. One must alter their expectations accordingly. Motor Trend magazine never does a side-by-side comparison of the BMW 3 Series to the Ford Fiesta... even though they are both cars.

The Plano case will hold four full sized pistols. When I say full sized, I'm referring to a 1911 or Glock 17 or similar. If you have a huge hunting revolver then you have special storage needs. The three foam system works nicely to allow you to separate the contents into two layers, each protected on both sides. I find the foam to be suffient to hold the contents firmly enough so that they don't move in transit and handling. However, I have mine loaded up on both sides of the foam separator. If you load only one side, you might not have as snug a fit.

The external case is ABS type plastic and is very durable. The hinges and latches work well, and the handle is comfortable and well fitted. The case has ""feet"" molded into the back hinged side so that it can be stood alone without danger of tipping over easily. There is also a ""hasp"" ring that can be used to lock the case with a padlock.

There is a place for the expensive cases and reasons to own them - like for air travel, etc. But there certainly is also a place for the less expensive no-frills cases like this Plano case. Good storage, good protection, and decent security. All at a very affordable price. Bottom line is that this case give perfect quality and function for its price.

B000P3WPKK,5.0,I was looking for a storage case to store pistols and magazines in and came upon this one. I read several reviews about how this case would not hold your pistols and mags in place.

These are not industrial grade cases to fill with expensive heavy equipment or that you should expect to hold up to airline or road use.  But they are $12.  For that price they are an excellent value and could be used to carry tons of different things.",Excellent value when on sale.,True,
B000P3WPKK,5.0,"I rated 5 stars because it fulfills my need at an affordable price... I'm using it to store my airsoft pistols.  It's very roomy (maybe a little too much space, because things do move around a bit when carried).  Currently it's about full having 3 guns and 6 mags in there: mac10 (1 mag), 1911 (3 mags), and m9 (2 mags).  I'm not so sure it would hold up to heavy duty abuse or real firearms as they are heavier.

This leads me to my only complaint.  For all Plano cases in general, make the foam a bit denser because heavier, skinnier guns (including accessories such as magazines) will slide around during transport and bang against each other.

Overall, well worth the price... if you're looking for something heavier duty, you gotta shell out more money though.",Great purchase for the price!,True,

B000P3WPKK,4.0,"I purchased one of these cases from a gun store and it came with foam that was precut in a grid so you could make very clean holes. This case from Amazon did not have that although it is the same model/brand. I am using it for some electronics instead of a gun. The plastic is not super high quality however it will hold a gun just fine. I would not use this for a gun with a kid in the house though. If you need a case for a project, I highly recommend this. If you need a case for a gun, I would recommend a Pelican case.","Good case, no pick n' pluck foam",True,
B000P3WPKK,5.0,"I bought this case to protect my FOSTEX MR-8HD multitrack recorder. The inside dimensions (was dying to know these before I bought it!) are 11.25"" front to back x 15"" wide x 6"" high (base to lid). With the foam, it's tighter, of course, but you know what you want to put inside and whether or not you need all the foam.

It comes with two identically diecut egg carton style dense foam inserts, about an inch or so thick (each). One is set inside the lid, the other sits in the middle like the meat of a sandwich. There's also a flat, 1/2-inch diecut foam pad on the base of the case. All of the foam inserts can be easily removed. The case's handle and latch indents are molded into the case, and the foam inserts trace the outline for a custom fit. The latches pivot like a simple hinge, which will last much longer than latches that are molded onto the shell and eventually break off. Likewise, the case's primary hinge is real, like a plastic tackle box (an appropriate comparison, since Plano knows tackle boxes), so it too will last over time. The latches snap closed, and there's a padlock hole inside the handle compartment in case you want to deter curious lookers.

Back to my use as a case for my Fostex recorder. I have a little past experience putting electronics with knobs into tight, foam cases. Knobs don't like too much pressure against them, especially if you're moving the item around and stressing the knobs even more. They can stop working or decide to do funny things when you're not even touching them. So I made a paper pattern to indicate where the knobs are and traced it onto the upper foam. Then I cut out the areas where the knobs would be. Now, when the lid is dropped down, it floats just a little above the ""closed line,"" which provides enough pressure to keep the unit snug. I put a little piece of the leftover foam behind the recorder to absorb shock when the case is put down like a briefcase. I didn't need the middle foam insert. One other thing, I keep the recorder on the left side of the case, leaving a nice open section for the power cord. The manual fits nicely under the recorder.

While it's no road warrior (I wouldn't subject it to being crushed or manhandled), it's actually a pretty tough box. I highly recommend it!",Great Multipurpose Case!,True,16

The case has a foam insert that allows for the layering of items to be transported safely, and also decent hinges and snap closures. While it does have a place to put a small padlock (not included), this should not be used as secure storage for firearms as it would take less than a minute or two to get into the case with simple tools.

I am happy with the case since it meets all of my needs.

B000P3WPKK,5.0,"I have purchased several of these, from various Wal-Marts with prices varying from 9.96-11.97. A great box to keep your guns dry, clean and unscratched while traveling to and from the range or field. Plenty of room for several pistols or a couple guns and ear and eye protection.. the foam is easily replaceable with craft foam from Hobby Lobby if you mess your up. These are no substitute for a safe or metal lock box as these are easily opened by a determined child.",Great Value,False,3
B000P3WPKK,5.0,"I was looking for an inexpensive case to hold a paintball marker of mine, and ran across this. It isn't a Pelican like what I have for some other stuff, but in a way that's good because I couldn't afford the appropriately-sized Pelican case.

This isn't meant to shield valuables from heavy damage, that's what a Pelican would do, but you'd pay 10x the price. This will be excellent for carrying anything which would fit.. netbooks, electronics, firearms, etc, on a daily basis. It isn't waterproof.

DETAILS:

It's a sturdy ABS-style plastic, with actual hinges for the clips and the case itself. It'll withstand average forces, and light impacts. It comes with 3 layers of foam: 2 outer layers of eggshell-style foam, and the inner layer which has perforated sections which you can tear out as needed.

DIMENSIONS:

I didn't see dimensions in the description, which would've been beneficial, but here they are.

The label says (presuming outside measurements): 16.75"" x 14"" x 6""
My actual measurements (inside): 16"" x 10"" x 6""

Inside measurements will always be a little less as seen above. This will fit a paintball marker and barrel nicely.

Not much else to say.. it's a case, it was $20 shipped, and it'll keep my paintball marker safe during transport. Well worth the money.","Super value, good product",True,60
B000P3WPKK,4.0,"This case is a great value.  As mentioned by other reviewers, it is not a super rigid case.  It has 2 sheets of convoluted foam, and 1 sheet of flat perforated foam that can be used to create cutouts.

This case is great for transporting pistols to and from the range, or on trips where the are in your care the whole time.  It does great at keeping the guns from banging around in the trunk of your car, for instance.  I have taken several trips with it, and have not noticed the guns, magazines, or optics shifting at all.

If, however, you have to ship the case when it would be out of your direct control, I do not think it is rigid enough to be thrown around by someone who does not care about it.  While it can be locked, breaking the locking tabs off would be a trivial matter.  As long as you don't expect this to be as durable as a $150 pelican, you should be very satisfied.",Great value for the price,True,
B000P3WPKK,5.0,"From what I see so far this is a good case for some range trips. In mine I can easily fit my 5 handguns and a few magazines for each gun. There is even more room available and I think for $20 it's a great deal. I put my USP 9, USP 40, XD 40, Sig Mosquito, and S&W Bodyguard in it easily and the USP 40 and XD 40 have lights mounted on them. I also have 2 - 3 extra mags per gun in there. There were a few reviews saying that the guns slide all over the case. I have no experienced this. After I put the guns in the case for the first time, I shook it up pretty good for a few minutes and got no movement. I will say this about the case though. Although there is room to hold a lot of ammo along with the guns, I won't be doing that because I don't think the case can take that kind of weight, but for $20 its everything I expected.",Great inexpensive case for range trips,True,

B000P3WPKK,5.0,"I purchased this to place 2 paintball guns in.  A tippman 98 custom & a tippman a5.  They both fit on the bottom level just perfectly.

When I close the lid it's a little tight but the foam depresses after a few moments & releives a bit of the pressure & settles in quite nicely.  Absoloutely perfect for this purpose.  Can't really comment on durability at this point seeing as I still have it in storage in my basement now, but for $[...] with shipping included even if it lasts a few years to and from the paintball course & storage I would be glad to get another.

These 4-pistol cases are excellent alternatives the the expensive carrying cases sold by the gaming stores and websites. The foam inserts are perfect for securely and safely carrying the figures. Gave one to my son for X-mas with some new figures.  It's worked so well, I just ordered two more.",Just ordered two more!,True,3
B000P3WPKK,4.0,"I have some vintage camera lenses that came with really nice leather storage cases.  As much I like the dedicated cases, I do not want to spoil them by lugging them around in the car or truck.  And in fact one of these cases has a zipper that failed leaving it unsuitable for storing camera lenses on the go.

When I started looking for portable cases to store these lenses when I go on the road, I came upon the Pelican and Otter Box style cases.  These are everything they promise - rugged, water and dust proof, and capable of withstanding years of hard abuse.  And they're pretty expensive.  Now I really want to protect my camera gear, and when I'm traveling under hostile conditions I use Zero Halliburton cases that are the metal version of the Pelican and Otter cases.  But for car or truck-based trips where I am not going to be subjecting the gear to rough handling, and a lighter case would be appropriate, enter the Plano Four Pistol Case.

Make no mistake about it - this case is not waterproof.  It will keep a casual splash out of the case, but I would not recommend this for heavy wet conditions, like a boat for example.  Go with the high-end cases meant for this sort of activity.

The foam lining is not the same grade of foam as the Zero Halliburton.  This foam is a lot softer and does not support the same amount of weight.  It appears that this foam is not meant to be cut though it does have pre-scored cubes for that purpose.  I cut the solid piece of foam and used it for the top layer.  The two lenses, both large (300mm and 400mm) soon showed that the foam would not support their combined weight.  I got another piece of foam from factory computer packing and made a second layer of foam.  This cured the problem and now the lenses stay in their cut-outs and do not shake around when the case is closed.  This is the only reason I gave this item a four star rating.

The case itself closes and latches well, is lightweight and reasonably compact.  They're large enough for quite a number of items.  I use a second one, not cut out, to transport our walkie-talkies, charger bases, and rechargeable battery chargers and power cords.

There is a provision for locking the case, though that's really silly because the hasp could be cut with a razor knife.  I like to look at this feature as an additional way to secure the cover and ""keep honest people honest"" since it really would not prevent a motivated individual from getting into the case.",A Real Bargain...,False,3

This is not a computer case--why people think it will be a sturdy laptop or netbook case is beyond me, because it it's not meant to snuggly contain sensative heavy electronic equipment, it's a pistol case.  Pistols are three dimensional objects that comform to foam, laptops are flat and slick finished.  Don't buy this product as a laptop/netbook case---it's a pistol case.

Three layers of foam make it easy to store magazines on a separate layer from pistols.  It's a great to/from range case and excellent storage case.",Excellent DURABLE Poly Pistol Case,True,

My older/smaller one struggled to fit three. It's not incredibly sturdy but does have lock holes to give you that false sense of security. But, if someone wanted in, it wouldn't be very difficult.

The real problem with shoulder holsters is that in a struggle, your right handed adversary has your gun right within reach; same with cross draw holsters.

But this box.  Let me tell you what I do with this box.  I carry my laptop in this box.  All of the power cables, USB cords, SD cards, & USB thumb drives are hidden between the first & second layers of foam.  The computer & DVD writer go right on top between the second & third layers of foam.

Laptop cases are expensive and none of them are as roomy as this one.

Well, 6 hours on the river and I was sold that my 40 bucks was NOT wasted.  I drilled holes in the plastic seat and used the 3 screws through those loops to hold it in place and I'd never been so comfortable for so long in that kayak.  I'd sat on a thick towel in the past, but it always eventually got wet, hard, and ineffective.  The next week I took out the Casco138 and just layed this 'over' the padded seat in that boat - it stayed in place without the mounting screws just fine and improved the seating experience greatly in that boat also.  If you have any type of seat that becomes uncomfortable or hard after awhile - I recommend this.  I do think it also kept me cooler/dryer, maybe due to the fact it lifted me a bit and allowed more air flow and kept me from sitting in wet.

  They are definitely sturdy.
  I removed the knife from the set, as I use a Mora for my eating knife, and the knife is really, really robust, and probably weighs as much as the spoon and fork combined. I removed the ring also, so these really weigh nothing with just the fork and spoon.

I like to eat my meals right out of the packs to save on dishes, and I was hoping the spoon would be long enough to not get my hand all messy but alas, it's just too short.

B000Y9IV3A,5.0,"These are exactly what they say they are, and a good product.

PROS
* The ring is very helpful.
* While I wouldn't recommend putting it to the test, for what it's worth, we did use the fork on some pretty hot stuff (flipping sausages in a pan) and it didn't melt or get damaged at all.
* Sturdy, and feel like normal utensils.

CONS
* Wish they came in other colors (if, for no other reason, to be able to easily tell whose set is whose) but that's a superficial concern.

BOTTOM LINE
No reason not to purchase these unless you're going for ultimate compactness and lightness, in which case, you should carefully compare the weights in the product details of various utensil sets.

B0018PYN1S,5.0,"This device has been an excellent tool to assist in my daughters training in fast pitch softball. A few of the parents laughed as they thought why do you care about speed, at 11 years old speed is not important. They are wrong. Speed is a great indicator of proper form, fatigue and progress. When I catch my daughter and ask for a change up I expect it to be 10 MPH less than her fast ball. This radar is very close to the Jugs and Pocket radar in terms of accuracy and super easy to use. Radar as a tool helps the coach or parent determine if the player is using proper form, is tired or injured. I have used this radar for 7 months and it works great.
The one recommendation is to ensure that you try a few different positions for the radar on the glove to ensure accuracy. I use it on a catchers mitt and mounted it right where the thumb meets the hand. Works great there.",This device has been an excellent tool to assist in my daughters training in fast ...,True,

It's pretty accurate too.  I would certainly recommend it to anyone that needs to monitor pitch speed on a regular basis.",Works great!,True,
B0018PYN1S,4.0,"This works great for a coach catching balls from their pitcher during practice.  You don't have to worry about aiming a radar tool at the flight path of the ball, since you are catching the ball.

Since this measures the speed of the ball at the glove, per the instructions, you have to estimate the speed of the ball leaving the pitcher's hand, which is when the ball is traveling the fastest.

Readings can be affected by glove movement while catching the ball.  Occasionally it won't read a pitch.

Good for comparing pitchers in practice, and for ensuring fastball and off-speed pitches have a good change in speed.

The leather sheath is certainly superior to the plastic ones most other Norse knives come with. The rubber handle is a joy to hold.  It  is almost full-tang, with a usable finger guard--which brings up the only thing I feel is somewhat questionable.  Namely, the fact that the finger guard, where the tang passes through, has gaps (small, to be sure; but gaps nonetheless) around the tang.  I don't like the idea of liquids or materials being able to penetrate those gaps.  My plan is to carefully mask off the finger guard and insert clear nail polish--I think that will permanently seal it.

Still, it's a very comfortable bodysuit, and unlike some reviewers, I didn't find it running small, unlike the Capezio and Danskin bodysuits here on Amazon.

B001PQVOOY,5.0,"I have mountain bikes, heavier than our road bikes and limited garage space to store. I did considerable research before buying this Thule.  This rack is made of heavy duty steel not the cheap thin Chinese variety.  It was easy to put together, sturdy and steady when loaded with our heavy bikes.  The adjustable racks are a real plus and makes balancing the bikes and vertically orienting them for easy loading and unloading quite convenient.

B001PQVOOY,4.0,"I ordered this rack to hold two large girls touring bicycles.  First, as a 60 year old woman, I had very little trouble putting the rack together.  Once it was time to put the bikes on, there was alot of adjusting of rack arms to fit my two girls bikes that do NOT have the standard middle men's bicycle bar.  But the bikes are holding and I wanted them kept off their tires and this worked out.  I did not want holes in my garage, so the free standing was perfect for me.  The frame and bike are compact in size, so you are not taking up alot of your area space.  When you buy this product, remember that bar ""L"" is attached to the main rectangular frame just above the Thule name bar.  I needed to use an hammer protected by cardboard to budge the tightly wedged ""L"" bar out.  You will really enjoy this product if you have mountain or mens bicycles, very easy to load and unload.  It is a bit more trouble for womens touring bicycles.  Solid product.",A really good adaptable product,True,
B001PQVOOY,4.0,"This looks identical to all the other 'bike stackers' with a THULE sticker on it. Only complaint is the arms are too long and too wide and makes it difficult to place the bike on the rack. Another company makes shorter arms that appear to function with this so that should help.

This is steel, so rust/ paint scratches could be an issue. I wish it were made of aluminum for better corrosion resistance.",Thule Bike Stacker,False,
B001PQVOOY,4.0,"I read some other reviews about how hard it was to assemble and it seemed unstable, but I put mine together in less than 20 minutes.  I also loaded a beach cruiser on top and a hybrid mountain bike on the bottom (probably not recommended, but easier access to my bike) and it hasn't moved.  I even have a curious 18 month old boy who loves to spin the wheels of the bike on the bottom.  The only improvement I can see is the way the arms are stabilized.  You have to twist them on with a hand tightened screw, which made me a little apprehensive but like I said it hasn't moved.  Also, I don't care too much for the arms that hold the bike, I think they should be padded or at least have a cloth layer on them.  I can see how constant racking and de-racking can eventually lead to scratches.  No big deal on my bike, but for those people that own the expensive road bikes, that might be a big deal.",Works as described,True,3

The arms are easily adjusted and seem to hold securely.  You will need a wrench to tighten the bolts when assembling the frame as tools are not included in the box.  The Bike Stacker is easy to assemble and took me about 10 minutes to complete.  Some of the other reviews mention rust being an issue if this bike holder is kept in a humid environment and I agree that this could be an issue.  The paint on the frame doesn't seem very durable as there were several chips with exposed metal that could be a problem if the unit were kept outdoors.

B001PQVOOY,4.0,"Advisement to all buyers of the Thule BSTK2 Bike Stacker (and its brother SportsRack): This is good sturdy rack, which can hold an electric bike at 90lbs [on the bottom rack only], but here are easy steps to make your rack safe.  #1) Purchase 4 individual [2"" c-clamps] (approx.$2 each) and use each one to clamp each rack arm to the uprights, as this will absolutely prevent the rack arms from poping off the uprights while your bike is high or low on the rack. #2) Have an old, used or new innertube (approx.x 2.0 in diameter)? Cut off about 12"" for each rack arm; put about 1/2 teaspoon of non-oily lotion inside one end of the opening, and carefully slide the innertube sleeve over the rack arm (use patience and elbo grease). I have 2 mountain bikes and 2 electric bikes, and none would fit properly on the racks with the plastic sliders. So I removed the plastic sliders (which came with the rack) and put the used innertube sleeves on the rack arms. With a dab of Pam (teflon cooking spray on a cloth) wiped on top of the new sleeves, the bikes are 100% easier to mount, adjust, and remove. You shouldnt use ""green slime"" innertubes unless they are thoroughly cleaned, the lotion will eventually dry and allow the sleeves to properly grip the arms and stay in place.( Maybe Thule should include the c-clamps with their racks for safety reasons.) #3) Do a reasonable approximate measurement of where the rack arms will fit thru your bike and then adjust the arms with a tape measure or ruler (this is much easier for mounting heavier bikes). The c-clamps will keep your adjustments locked in placed and your bike safe from falling off or being damaged. The rack is also good for removing tires or wheels, make shifter adjustments, and general maintainance a whole lot easier.",Sturdy  and reliable,True,10

 We did not prep it for rain which is just asking for it to happen so you know what happened we got caught in the rain A LOT of rain.

B002PB2HPS,5.0,REALLY nice tent. Easy to put up.,Great purchase!,True,
B002PB2HPS,5.0,"Did not have time to setup/test-out prior to first camping trip.  So first time took 30 mins with 2 ppl to setup in light drizzle.  Did not come with instructions and although it's pretty obvious how it fits together, the optimal sequence isn't as obvious (I included the steps that worked for me in the bottom of review).

Minutes after getting the tent up, we had a 1 hr downpour with 20 mph winds followed by light drizzle all night.  The tent looked strong & steady with just a few minor leaks around zipper, but all the seams were dry.  Water did pool over the porch room (as others have also said) and began slowly leaking in, but I believe that's because I didn't fully secure the tarp down properly (see step 16 below).  Haven't experience rain after we properly secured the tarp, but the tarp did look much more taut.

Overall, very happy with size, rain & wind protection.  I liked that the circular room divider door completely protects the sleeping area from mesquites while coming in and out of the porch area all day and the dual zipper allows you to zip the bottom up so toddlers and pets can't escape and creepy crawlies can't crawl in to the sleeping area while allowing adults to easily step over for easy access to all rooms.  It's also wide enough to fit an inflated queen size air mattress through.

Rear sleeping compartment easily fits 2 queen size airbeds with about 1-1/2ft clearance at top and bottom of mattresses for your bags.  Porch room is decent size for 2 chairs with room to put your feet up and still have an unobstructed center aisle to walk through.  The included stakes are crappy and I'm convinced would of pulled-out during our first stormy night so buy some good ones (need 20).  I got the 7"" spikes with the green tie down heads - very secure in grass and not overly difficult to pull out (Harbor Freight sells a packet of 6 spikes for $3).

These steps seem to work best for me:
  1. Assemble poles.
  2. Temporarily stake down 11'x16' ground tarp (sold separately - got mine at Harbor freight... good quality)
  3. Unroll tent
  4. Stake back 2 corners first, then back-middle.
  5. Pull front taunt and center, then stake front 2 corners, then front-middle (i.e. entrance).
  6. Now fold and tuck the ground cover tarp complete under the tent along the smaller front room section so rain doesn't collect under your tent (I may cut my tarp to size in the future).
  7. Stake one side of the back room, then the other side.
  8. Stake one side of the front room, then the other side.
  9. Thread the 2 long thin poles through the back-room sleeves and secure the 2 poles together directly in their middles using a bowknot (the tricky part is keeping the bowknot directly in the middle of the thin poles when you mount them on the thick support poles).
10. Thread the shorter thin pole over the entrance.
11. Lay the thicker support poles near their mounting pin locations and mount the angled pole connector.
12. Have someone tall climb inside the tent and hold up the center where the 2 thin poles cross.
13. Quickly connect the 4 poles in the back room before installing the 2 poles in the front room.  Install to top thin pole then tuck over the pin on the bottom.
14. Have someone help you pull the tarp over the tent.
15. Stake the guidelines in the back down first then the front, but keep them loose.
16. At each pole location, (a) hook the tarp in, (b) strap the Velcro around the pole and then (c) tie bowtie through the slotted opening on the black angled pole connector.  Note, there's a Velcro strap over the center of the door (the first night, I was in a hurry to beat the rain and didn't see/do steps b & c and water pooled over the porch room and slowly soaked/dripped through).
17. Finally, evenly tighten the 5 guide wires.
18. Double check the stakes to ensure they didn't get pulled up.","The perfect tent!  Not capable of free-standing, but strong and stable when properly staked down",True,2

B002PB2HPS,5.0,"This tent is huge. I loved it. My husband and I do not have a lot of experience putting up tents. My husband and I put this huge tent up in less than 20 minutes. It consists of 3 fiberglass rods. The 2 longer rods go in the top of the main sleeping portion and a smaller one across the front top of the screen room. Then, you have 4 straight metal rods and 2 rods with a slight bend on one end. The 4 straight metal rods connect to the longer fiberglass rods with 4 plastic elbows (teeth side to the fiberglass rod) and then to the metal pins in the bottom of the tent. The 2 bent rods connect directly to the fiberglass rod in the top of the screen room and to the metal pins in the bottom of the tent. The fly was very easy to throw on and tie down. The whole ceiling is mesh so if you are not expecting any rain and it is warm enough leave the fly off to gaze at the stars or for cloud watching during the day. I plan on taking my 3 little pups with me next trip and the front screen room is perfect for them. the rooms are separated by another fully zippered door.

Windows allow for good ventilation

It says it has e-ports, none that I could find.
Tricky to set up - now that I understand it it set up quick.

Some of the design elements, such as pockets at the base of each window to tuck the panels when unzipped, are great touches.

This is only the 3rd tent I've ever put up and stayed in in my life so I'm relatively new to camping but the following is my opinion on how well this tent works for a newbie camper like me. I'm still looking for something a bit smaller for backpacking so please feel free to leave me your opinions on some cost effective options. I purchased this one for my family to use, that would be me and my husband (30 something adults) and two teenagers.

I LOVE this tent! having a screened in porch with an attached floor is amazing!!!!!!!! No bugs or frogs in our food! I love the space. This tent is great for summer time due to all the ventilation and mesh and thin walls. I would imagine due to it's size and thin fabric it wouldn't be a good choice for winder time or colder areas.

For setup, I know several said that it was hard to setup but my husband and I did it our first time in 15 minutes and it was relatively easy to do. I can see how it would be difficult with one person because you have to lift the dome part of the bigger/back room up into the air so if you are going to be alone it could be challenge.

Another concern for this tent was that the porch is a good 6 to 8 inches shorter in height than the bedroom. You can fully stand up in the bedroom and move around but I had to bend my head in porch and I'm only 5'4. :-) But the porch is mostly to be used as a storage area and sitting room anyway.

I caught this tent on sale for $120 and it was worth every penny! Even full price at $160 I think it would be worth it.",This tent is Amazing. It's a portable Cabin more than a Tent!,True,94
B002PB2HPS,4.0,"It's really nice and definitely room I'm 5'3"" and I can just walk in and around it 4 stars because it is a just slightly flimsy on the 2 windows in the bigger part of the tent and I was expecting this to be brand new apparently or it might up been used then returned because I am missing 1 part where 2 posts connect to each other and makes a corner piece. As an 8 person tent I bought for me and 1 other person you cana make this a small house lol that was the fun part. No leaks when it rains/pours pretty sturdy through it, nice breeze when the windows are open bug will crawl all around it so just use some bug repellent and you'll be fine. My backyard is filled with fat black ants and other insects from my big tree I have but only the baby baby spiders could fit through the netting. The repellent came in handy.  Sleeping in it isn't like your completely outdoors I don't get that groggy outside feeling after waking up, if your tent in is the heat all day make sure your windows and all open and that you have some type of breeze or fan it DOES get hot.",Great deal i love this tent,True,
B002PB2HPS,5.0,"I love the way the screen covers stow into the base of the windows, much easier than rolling and buckling up the fabric.

B002PB2HPS,5.0,"We camp a lot and wanted a nice, large tent.  This one is perfect:

PROS:
1.  2 double air mattresses fit in the main tent, though with little room between the two.
2.  On a scale of 1 to 10 for putting up (1 being hardest, 10 being easiest) it's an 8 or 9.  It took me, hubby, & 13 yr old son about 20 minutes to put it up the first time.  We learned NOT to stake it initially as said in the directions.  Once we got the tent up, we realized the stakes weren't tight enough and ended up redoing all of them.
3. Tent was nice & tall.
4.  We had a MASSIVE storm with over 40mph winds.  Most of the tent campers left in the middle of the night due to the rains & high wind. We braved it out.  The sides were blown hard enough they were touching me while I was laying down, but when the wind stopped they popped right back up.  Though there are several places (see CONS below) where the tent doesn't zip shut, there was very little water inside the tent. A LARGE branch (over 4' long & about 3"" wide) fell on the porch of the tent & put about an inch tear in the rain guard, but somehow no water got in.  Still not sure how that happened & certainly can't blame construction of the tent.
5.  Love the porch area.  We used it primarily for storage but next time we plan on bringing a card table to play games if it's raining or if the bugs are out too much.

CONS:
1.  It's about a foot to large to fit on a standard State Park tent pad (somewhere around 12X12).  The sides fit perfectly, but the porch had to be staked off of the pad.
2. The sides/front of the porch only zip 3 ways.  The top of each has no zipper & isn't opened.  During the rainstorm we had, though, no rain leaked in, so I guess it's not that much of an issue.
3.  In the back of the tent, there is an air vent type of thing.  It also doesn't zip at the top & water did seep in here.  It wasn't horrible but it was enough to be aggravating.
4.  Tent is not light which matters not to us since we don't ever plan on having to carry it very far, but if this is an issue, be aware.

Overall we love this tent & hope to enjoy many more camping trips with it!",Tent Survives Torrential Downpour & Massive Winds,True,3

B002PB2HPS,4.0,"Prior to our most recent experience, our family only ever ""camped"" in a camper.  This time, we decided to go tent camping for our week's vacation in WV.  We spent a small fortune on every rookie camping gadget you can imagine, so this tent had 4 people and LOTS of gear in it, with tons of room to spare.  It went up easily, after we figured out that the corners were supposed to be a strange shape in the main part of the tent.  It is very nice and very sturdy, although we did get some condensation on the inside the first night.  I'm not sure that wasn't our fault, though.  We did not experience any rain, so I cannot speak to that issue, however we did have a nice stiff breeze all one day and it did not give this tent a problem.  Take-down was easy, as well.  My husband is 6'4"" and had no problems standing in the main part of the tent.  The screened part is a little shorter, but at 5'9"" our teenaged son was fine.

I have only three small complaints: this is a light putty colored taffeta, and if you have a tent light inside and are near other campers, they can see EVERYTHING you are doing inside the tent, so you have to change clothes, etc., in relative darkness; there is no place to hang a tent light in the screened-in part, although we fashioned something out of a bread tie and the window zipper pull that would hold a Halo 180 (best tent light ever); and the biggest complaint is that there is no place to run an electric cord into the tent, so your only choice is to leave the zippered doors open a bit to run a cord in there.  It not only lets bugs in, but it can present a tripping hazard.  Those things said, I shopped for tents for 2 months and still think I made the best choice.  I would still buy this tent, even knowing what I know now.

Keep in mind that this is a HUGE tent.  Make sure you will have a big enough spot of level ground for it ahead of time.  You will not need to worry about leaving stuff outside, if it rains, especially if you pack like seasoned campers, rather than the ""kitchen sink"" campers that we were.  We love our Tent-Mahal and got complements on it from other families camping nearby.  (The backpackers just looked on in a combination of wonder and disgust at our excessive amounts of ""stuff."")  We look forward to using it again this fall, but I wish there was a practical list somewhere of what you REALLY need for 7 days of camping with a family consisting of older parents (read: needing 2 twin air mattresses) and teens and tweens.  You write it and I'll buy it!",Tent-Mahal,True,33
B002PB2HPS,5.0,"Took this big boy camping this weekend. My boys who are boy scouts kept saying how great it would be to have a tent this big. It fit our family of 4, with each of us have a cot to sleep on. All our overnight bags comfortably in there. We also liked that the porch area had a floor, it was nice to be able to sweep up any dirt we brought in, take off our shoes in that area before heading into the sleeping area. We had perfect weather in northern AZ, so I can't tell you how it handles rain or cold weather (nor do I hope to experience this while camping). I do suggest closing the porch section ALL THE WAY as critters, like lets say a skunk, might find it's way into your tent looking for the dog food you thought you stored properly (or putting even the dog food in the car at night! ;-)

This tent has a sewn in divider with a circular zipper door to go between rooms.

B002PB2HPS,5.0,"This tent worked great! It rained most of the weekend and the front screen area had a small fridge that was propped up on wooded pallets and away a few inches from the inside tent wall, and all my containers with food in it as well as the cartons that had drinks in it, stayed dry so they weren't falling apart while we were trying to pack up. Like some of the reviewers said both sections are super huge, but it is probably the size of a 5 person dome tent in the back half and a 4 person dome in the front but you can stand up in them if you are 5'3"". The only thing I kinda didn't like about it was the divider in between the rooms zipped from middle, in a circle and back to the middle. So if you kept it zipped halfway so you can see in the screen side, you would have to step over the half wall. A little annoying but made me feel better after I got invaded by raccoons and that at least gave them an option to stop before exploring the rest of the tent. The screen tent was opened by the raccoons, but the 2nd night I found a great option to use a bread tie to tie the 2 zips together and they didn't get in after that.",Great tent,True,

The rain lasted throughout the night and heavy at times, then more rain in the morning. With the amount of rain we got, I expected to have some leakage into our tent but it was not much, at all. I just wiped the rain away with a paper towel. I also protected and waterproofed the tent with the rainfly, a overhead tarp and a the footprint. I believe that to be the standard every time you camp. The tent is roomy and spacious, the screen room was amazing for toddlers to play in, great to avoid mosquitoes and still feel the breeze.

B002PB2HPS,5.0,"Very nice tent!  Lots of room in the back for 6-8 people to easily sleep in.  The front room with the screen will be great for eating and keeping bugs out!  Took my wife and I about 15 minutes to put it up.  I did treat the seams with waterproof spray to ensure we don't get wet when we go camping so I will provide an update after our trip.  Once you figure out how it goes up it will take less time to put it up once you go camping.  Only complaint is I don't understand why they don't provide bags large enough to put the tent back in once you break it back down, because after all we don't have  a factory to fold these in the tiny bags like they do.  SO putting it back in the bag might be a bit of a hassle if you don't follow their break down instructions.  But overall I'm happy with our tent and the kids seem to love it!",Great Tent!,True,

B002PB2HPS,5.0,"Despite committing the cardinal sin of not setting this up at home before the trip, and getting there late enough that the first time we set it up was in the dark, this was still not horrible to assemble, and now that I see how the parts fit together, it should be very quick the next time.

Unlike most tents, you really do want to stake this one down before you put in the poles- we had a few stakes pull out, and those locations were a lot trickier to get set than the other ones where the stakes stayed in.

We only had three people in here, so we put an extra tarp down in the front room, then used that as a changing room-- we left all the gear and dirty shoes up there, which meant the back sleeping area stayed nice and clean.

We had perfect weather, so I can't speak to how waterproof it is, and while we threw the fly over it, we didn't bother to tie anything down.

The only negative I have about this was that it seemed to heat up really fast with the windows closed-- we had a lantern hanging from the top of the tent on a metal hook, and when we broke the tent down at 10AM, that hook was almost too hot to touch, and it wasn't even 75F outside yet.

B002PB2HPS,5.0,"I'm not a hardcore outdoorsman but I do like being in the outdoors and I don't mind camping on my own or with another adult. However, as a parent, I discovered that camping is a COMPLETELY different experience with two little kids. Kids need more space (at least if Mom and Dad want to get any sleep) and kids have a natural tendency to complain about any lack of comfort.

That's where this Wenzel Klondike tent really comes into a league of its own.

This is technically an 8-person tent but I'd say it fits six people ""comfortably"" and fits a ""family of four"" with plenty of room to move around and have some of your stuff inside the tent. The main tent room is large enough for a queen-sized inflatable mattress (something my wife insists upon nowadays) and the front room is big enough for our son and daughter to have their sleeping bags, clothes and lanterns inside the tent.

Setup was remarkably easy. I've never setup a multi-room tent like this before and it took minimal effort and I probably could have done it without reading the instructions (although I always do ... to avoid unpleasant surprises at the camp site). My wife and I had the entire tent setup in less than 10 minutes the first time (we can probably put the tent up in less than 5 minutes now that we know the process). Tearing down the tent and packing it back up takes a bit more time and effort (as usual) because you have to fold/roll everything back into the bags, but the process is just as easy in reverse.

All the screened-in openings have privacy flaps (including the door flap between the main room and the front room). We only had two problems during the camping trip:

1) Since the tent is so big sometimes people forgot it was a tent and left the front flaps open so more bugs got inside than usual. (Both the kids and Mom were guilty of that one).

2) Every child at the camp site wanted to come play inside our tent. This isn't such a terrible thing when you have kids who want to socialize and play with new friends ... but trying to manage a constant stream of kids wanting to play inside your family's tent gets old after about a day.

Honestly, I have nothing bad to say about this tent. If you're in the market for a large tent for a family camping trip then you'll be hard-pressed to find a better tent at a better price than this.

Highly recommended!",This amazing tent makes you the envy of the camp site.,True,
B002PB2HPS,5.0,Great,Five Stars,True,
B002PB2HPS,4.0,"Update: It has been 5 years since I bought this tent and it's still in use! The last time we used it, there was a terrible rain right before bed. It dumped bad for a solid hour and the tent was SOAKED inside!! All our stuff was very wet. We had to drive an hour home and come back the next day to break camp. It sucked. But really, the rain was quite bad. I normally put a tarp over any tent I'm in if rain is expected, and I think we would have been fine if I had done this, but we were at the shower house when the storm rolled in and we were caught by surprise. I also think, if the sides and roof didn't drape so much, less water would have pooled and dripped in.

Now that our kids are a little older and we no longer need to shlep a pack n' play or a stroller, I am looking for a great deal on a slightly smaller, more manageable tent, and I prefer a dome tent to the cabin style because I think the square shape just invites the sides to drape and collect water compared to a dome shape.

I bought this tent 3 years ago. My husband and I are experienced campers with pretty good gear, but we had recently procreated, which definitely changes the camping experience. This tent was inexpensive, and I am camping with little kids in good weather not too far from home, so I was fine with the quality of this tent. If I was doing more hard-core camping, I wouldn't have bought this tent at all. I would have bought a smaller tent of higher quality.

That said, this tent has been great. I was debating on whether to get a separate screen house or a tent with one included. My child was 18 months old at the time and I needed a tent large enough for the pack n play, plus a screened area to get out of the bugs if needed. I decided on this tent because the screen room has a floor, (most picnic shelter-type screen houses have no floors,) which is great for small children to play in! I zip up the divider between the two rooms so she can play in the screened room without jumping all over our air mattresses or tracking in dirt. I also bring the potty chair to avoid nighttime restroom trips through the national forest, and it is WONDERFUL to have that in a separate area of the tent from where we sleep!

 It was on sale for a hundred twentyfive from blaine's farm and fleet, with free shipping, so I went for it! For the price, it has been splended! We have sure gotten our money's worth out of it, camping with our young child three times a year for the past three years. This year, we plan to take our new 6 month old camping in it as well.

The one problem with huge tents like this is that they are totally not warm at all. We used a 6 person tent previously, and it would get nice and warm with just my husband and I sleeping in it, but this tent pretty much keeps the outside air temperature, so good warm sleeping bags are a must if it gets cool at night where you plan to camp. Camping with kids, I do wish it was a little warmer, and we're waiting to make sure the nights will be warm enough for our baby. In our old tent, we wouldn't have to wait, but our old tent couldn't fit a whole freaking pack n play either, so meh...

The screen room: Another annoying thing is the way the screen room is set up---you can see from the pictures that the divider is raised 6 inches or so off the floor. We all trip over this thing constantly. I am not tall at all, (and neither is my 4 year old!) but the way I have to duck down to fit through the ""portal"" between rooms while lifting my feet over this 6"" opening is just irritating. My kid inevitable wipes out several times a day on this thing. The GOOD thing about the screened in area is that it can also be used as a sleeping area, unlike the similar Coleman Weathermaster, which I also considered. We took our teen-aged niece camping twice, and she was able to have her own area so it wouldn't be too awkward for her sharing a bed with me, and that was nice.

The other con is that there is no bathtub floor, meaning there is a seam from the floor right along the ground instead of coming up a foot or so. I LOVED the bathtub floor of our old tent! No leaks! We avoid camping when poor weather is expected because it's just not worth the hassle with littles, but we have weathered a couple of average rains in this tent with no leakage. However, I wouldn't be shocked if at some point it did leak due to the floor seams and the overall drapyness of the sides. We always put a tarp down underneath, and throw another tarp on top if rain is expected because who wants to get wet?

Overall, this tent has provided many fun trips for our growing family, but if you are used to more serious camping with more serious (and expensive) gear, you will see what I mean when I say that you get what you pay for with this tent. For the price, we figured if it lasted us one season, it was worth it, and it has exceeded that expectation! I highly recommend this for families who need space and don't want to spend tons of cash to take their family camping! Get out there and have fun! There is nothing better than taking your kids away from the TV and into the woods for a week.",Love this tent for fair weather family camping...you get what you pay for.,False,9
B002PB2HPS,4.0,"I have been camping for several yrs. I have a permanent campsite on my land, in western NY. I stay set up from April till November, and camp as much as possible.
 I saw this tent, and thought it would be perfect. The Klondike is a very nice tent, but I feel it could be better for the price. When I set the tent up with a friend (two people needed for set up) it went right up, no problem. The stakes that it comes with are a joke. It came with four 5"" plastic stakes, and some metal wire stakes. Plan on buying better stakes when you get this tent. I used 9"" plastic stakes to secure the main part of mine, and used the 5"" stakes (included) for the screen room area of the tent.
When I got the tent up, and the rain fly on.. I opened the tent and walked in to inspect it. Right away I noticed a hole by one of the corners. This is because they didn't reinforce the spots where the stakes go, so be careful on yours! I mended mine with rubber cement + an old rain fly.

  -------Things I don't like about the Kodiak are----
1. Floor is not bath tubed. meaning, it doesn't go up the side of the tent at all.
2. Floor is very thin material, punctures easy.
3. Not reinforced by stake down locations, or anywhere else for that matter.
4. The sides of the screen room narrow by a foot from the main tent. The only part of this tent that is 11' wide is the main part, where you sleep. The screen room part is 9' at best and narrows down to 5' where the door is. The ad said it was 11'x16'. That's NOT true.
5. The main part and screen room is divided by a zipper door, but it zips in such a way that its inconvenient to use it.

  ------------What I like about the Klondike--------------

1. Its HUGE!!
2. It has a lot of room in the main cabin, it is 11x10. Lots of room.
3. It has great ventilation. Lots of windows and they are sufficient.
4. Great head room in the main cabin. Im 6'4"" tall, and can stand up in there no problem.
5. Water tight! Have not found any leaks yet. Its been up for 2 months so far.... and it has rained HARD a few times here in western NY.
6. The main cabin is roomy, you don't feel crowded at all. I have a queen airbed in there on a queen raised cot. its about the same size and width as my bed at home, and yet there is plenty of room to walk around it- on both sides. which is nice.
7. Though the screen room is small, its still nice to have for rainy days. Enough room for two chairs... and not be crowded.
8. The screen room has a floor, (same cheep thin material) and has zip up flaps to enclose it if it rains. So, it can be used for extra sleeping area if needed. Would fit 3-4 kids or 2 adults.

All in all its a good tent, and it has not given me any reason not to like it. I would recommend this tent to anyone that will be using it in a wooded area. I'm not sure it would fair very well in a wide open field.",Lots of room...Great tent- could be better.,True,2
B002PB2HPS,5.0,"We have several tents that we use for different occasions. I bought this one because we becomes friends with a group of people that really love to go camping.

But I think that is expected with such a large tent. The size of the tent is awesome there is enough room to comfortable fit 7, that is most we have slept in there at one time and we did not have a problem with room.

B002PB2HPS,4.0,"We just returned from a 3 day camping trip and the weather was beautiful. So, unfortunately I can not give a feedback on wind and rain. Reading the other reviews regarding the tents resistance to strong winds, I can only say that if you do have exceptionally strong winds, the tent is not that sturdy to withstand them.

We had clear skies and elected not to put up the rain tarp. We were able to see a full star sky through the big open (netted) ceiling of the tent. On the second set up, I built the tent in the dark with a flashlight by myself. It was very easy and it only took me about 15 minutes. The stakes are made of plastic and they will break and bend eventually, so buying extra more sturdy back-up stakes is probably a good idea.

Overall we are satisfied with the buy. I certainly would not take this tent into harsh weather such as strong wind and rain. It will handle medium winds and rain just fine I believe.",Quick and Easy to setup,True,

High winds threatened to topple it - it seems like it needs a few more loops for stakes around the widest part of the base. I liked the several loops and net pockets around the inside of the tent for hanging light objects and lights. Weird annoying thing - the zippered divider between the two rooms zips up clockwise but from the middle of the right hand side - so if you want to eave it half unzipped - you have to leave the bottom half of the divider zipped (what would the point be?) The zipper should start in the center on the floor or ceiling so you could leave it half zipped like a curtain (Or split in two halves like I have seem in other tents) Overal we thought this was a great value for a very big tent.,good value - great for hot weather,True,
B002PB2HPS,5.0,"Super easy to put together. (2 people required I think 3 would be perfect)

B002PB2HPS,4.0,"The people who complaining about the Wenzel Klondike 11x16 Tent need to learn that all tents are not created equal. The Wenzel tent is classified as a good weather tent. It isn't designed for torrential rains, snow or strong winds. There are tents that are designed for adverse weather conditions. Buy a tent that fits your camping conditions. Don't buy a low priced tent and expect it to handle all weather. If this tent took you longer than 30 minutes to set-up with two people, you were doing something wrong. I did it in 25 minutes alone. All light duty tents come with cheap plastic or thin steel tent pegs. I upgraded to the stronger tent pegs with the first tent I ever bought and am still using them. This tent is cheaply priced for such a large tent and you get what you pay for. Some reviews are just the ignorance of the buyer for not researching the proper tent for their camping situation. [...] Learn before you review.",People need to learn about tents,True,2
B002PB2HPS,5.0,This tent is so comfortable it is like bringing the house with you.  We attacked Big Sur CA and received many compliments.,Awesome,True,
B002PB2HPS,4.0,"This tent is good for the size and price.  We had a little bit of leakage from rain the very first time we used it, but I hadn't sealed the seams at all (never had to on my old Coleman) and it was a major downpour (several inches of rain over 2 days straight).  So, in reality, I think any tent would have had the little bit of leakage that we did.  I have since sealed it, and not had any problems.  I am 6' tall, and can stand up straight in the back room without issue.  I have had 2 queen size air matresses side-by-side in the back room as well, and they are just barely touching the walls.  It is not very good for colder weather as all heat escapes out the top (I had a small propane heater in the tent for 30 degree weather).",Pretty good value,True,3

I first night we camped in it it poured rain and we had tons of water going under our tent and it did pretty well. Some water seeped through the bottom but none came through the top. Overall a good tent. Set up was also pretty easy. Only took my wife and I about 10 minutes.",Great Tent. Very Spacious,True,
B002PB2HPS,4.0,"Very nice tent.  It is huge which has it ups and downs.  Upside, it's huge.  You have plenty of room for everything.  The front 'porch' really opens things up.  We set it up the night we got it and it went up easy....at home.  The downside is due to its size this thing catches wind.  A lot of wind.  We almost had to sleep in the car were it not for some extra line I had.  We went camping on the beach and could not get this thing to stand for the life of us.  We opened all the windows but the walls kept collapsing.  Luckily the wife packed some extra line and stakes, which I cut up to anchor the tops of the tent poles.  Once we figured it out and anchored every point down she stayed up for three days in that wind.  And it was very windy.  For the experienced and equipped outdoor folks (like us) this is a great buy.  Had we been unprepared amateurs we would have been sleeping in the car.",Huge has it's ups and downs.,True,
B002PB2HPS,4.0,"Purchased The Wenzel Klondike 11 x16 tent through AMAZON, arrived as expected on time, and in good shape (over-packed carton actually, everything that was suppose to be there was.  No visible problems with the tent material, attachment points, or poles/stakes and bags everything comes in. We liked the reviews, the 10 year warranty, and the fact that it is a proven tent line.

#1 We proceeded to lay down some 6Mil plastic sheeting from Lowe's 10x18ft on the ground, and set the tent on it
#2 We staked out the main stake tabs of the base, leaving a little slack to make it easier to adjust the poles when it came time for them.
#3 we assembled and ran the fiberglass poles through their respective tent fabric tunnels (our fabric tunnels was a kind of off red color).  And at this point we tied the tent center tie loose enough, to give some slack for lifting the poles.
#4 we assembled the steel poles for the four corners uprights and put their attachment hubs on, and fastened the tent to the respective hook space provided in each hub; and inserted the fiberglass poles in each hub (took some moving of the steel poles at various angles to get this done).  Also if poles have been exposed to the sun for very long?  They will get very hot, and we recommend using some ""Gripper"" type inexpensive gloves to handle them without getting burnt . . . yes I said burnt, they are extremely hot to the touch, for tender hands.  You can find versions of them for somewhere between $2.00-$20.00 bucks and may even have some from gardening or working.
#5 With the back two poles ready, we lifted the tent's steel poles at the ground end and put them in their pins.
#6 Repeating the same process for the second set of fiberglass and steel poles, in their pins.
#7 Then time for the front fiberglass/steel polls set up, and this is where it was important to have some slack in the tent-stake tabs (all of them), as it takes some ""LIFTING"" to get all the poles in their respective pins, and having them too tight would make this frustratingly difficult.
#8 With the 6Mil sheeting from Lowe's down and tucked in as needed (Note: two feet out pass the entrance end, we could now adjust the tent-peg tabs down tighter.
#9 We then went into the tent and tested all the zippers and made sure things were working and not binding, laid down cuts of the same 6Mil sheeting ""inside"" the two rooms of the tent; so the floor would be easier to take care of.  A camper next to us did NOT use any ground cover and tore a hole in their tent floor scooting things back and forth over the INSIDE of their tent, and the outside bottom was a mess too two days later.
#10 We then brought in our Queen Size 18in tall Air Mattress (with built in AC inflation) and ran the #14 25ft electric cord into the tent to inflate it, and NO, our tent did not come with a access port to pass a cord through.  Thinking of doing a DIY application for this where the tent rooms meet.
#11 We were then ready to bring in bedding, chairs, etc. and the wife wanted to lay down a blanket in the screen room area for the dogs (a 11yr old blue-healer and 2yr old Pomeranian) to lay on.  At this point we had not yet put on the rain fly . . . just enjoyed the unzipped windows and gentle breeze as we sipped some ice tea.
#12 Time came to check out the Rain/shade-fly.  So we unfolded it, and the Guy-lines and holding it at the midway point, we attached the plastic clips provided to the back rings on the poles, and walked it forward and reaching high we were able to bring it forward to the midway point, and attached the plastic clips, to their respective pole-rings.  Note:  The shade this provides when the suns up?  Is really decent, and yes, you will feel the heat coming through some, but not nearly as much as if it were not there at all.

Now you can leave it like this or continue to bring it forward to the ""Over"" the entrance fiberglass pole and clip it on the steel pole, but don't forget there is a short black hook/loop piece in the center between the front support material, (our tunnel material is off red color) you can use, to help keep it positioned.
Note: on the adjusters that came with the tent on the guy-lines?  There are two ways of using these . . .the right way and the wrong way; the wrong way will not hold when pulled on at the stake look end, the RIGHT Way is to use the loop on the opposite side of the knotted plastic piece, as the loop that goes around your stake, and it will hold fine.
Still, I do recommend having some extra tent adjusters around in case one of these break, as these don't look all that durable.  So I ordered some Liberty Mountain Aluminum Guy-line Adjuster 10pk from Amazon and may even switch them out for the ones that came with the tent.
I am also considering some different guy-line, maybe like the type that is very reflective, such as the 3M Reflective Braided Nylon Cord (ELW401, also sold on Amazon
#13 After all this, we went around the tent and attached various ties, and hook/loop in their respective places to help keep things more shipshape.  Some of these, may have even worked to our advantage, if we had connected them, when we were preparing the tent poles to be lifted; will have to do a follow up on that some time.  Follow up:  Found it best to tie them after raising the poles.
#14 Definitely consider getting some form of MSR Groundhog tent stakes, for harder ground, or as appropriate for your intended camping, as the ones that come with the tent just don't generally do the job, except on ""softer"" ground without gravel or hardtack.
#15  I really did like the way the little vent at the back of the tent helped with air drafting, and the dogs seemed to like to sleep near it; so don't block it if you can help it . . . unless its with a small AC unit LOL.
#16 We have bought and intend to use at some point, our old favorite PTFE Tent sealer from Star-Brite; I usually buy it in the Gallon size for use on any sealing projects around the homestead, I consider it the best of the best out there.

NOTE:
ZIPPERS! this tent does use smaller size zippers and pulls; and they should do the job, if handled well, and not abused.  Important thing to know and remember when using zippers in general?  Don't run them up and down ""fast"", as in a hurry.  The pull can develop a heat-sink between the upper/lower part that makes the zipper ""ZIP Together"" that will make it stop working and cause a repair, that could have been prevented.  Also, this tent will have a tendency to catch material in the zippers unless you hold the material out of the way of the zipper as your opening and closing.  Not paying attention to how you handle the material could/will cause a zipper malfunction or end in ripped material or loss of waterproofing at such points.
IF, you have children and pets?  You just know you can't depend on them to watch out for such things, and you may want to just keep the door zipper up a bit prevent problems of trying to push through the door.  I even thought about installing some Magnets along the door edge to let it close but still allow a push through as you may have seen on some TV Commercials, with the dog running through them, and closing immediately afterward.

There are NO ties at the top of the front screen room windows after zipping them up, this does not have to be a problem, but it would be nice to have a separating zipper on the center of each window cover to help prevent the windows from being blown through in a windy/raining downpour. I may yet install these at some point.
Also, there are NO tiebacks for the front flaps, when the entrance screen is zipped closed, that is another area a pocket such as provided for the tent diver has, would have come in handy for each side.  Here again is a DIY project that you may find handy.
Followup!  Discovered the top of the flaps can fold/roll forward into the bottom of each screen room window, as well as for the sleeping area windows.  Also we decided to keep the dogs from nosing open the screen room entrance we used a set of inexpensive 2 for $1.00 D-Ring/Carabiners to connect the three pulls together, or you can add some cording to make it easier to thread the D-Ring through inside and outside when not in the tent.

Some DIY you may try to make things easier?  Remember the shock-cord in the fiberglass poles can allow the poles to come apart, so don't jerk them when pushing/pulling, or maybe even put some ""Duct"" tape around the joint for easier handling; I even thought about putting some sticky-back Loop on each section where it meets and then using the hook part to keep them together.

As always, it is important to care for everything; and that means clean and dry after every use, tucked away in their proper bags/pouches, and not letting anything come in contact, that might poke a hole, or tear material if handled roughly.","Instructions would have been nice, but we did ok on setting it up",True,19
B002PB2HPS,5.0,"I bought this tent back in September of 2011 and have used it several times.  It is roomy, sturdy, and goes up with minimial aggrevation---unlike some other larger tents I've used. I very much liked the screened front room, it serves as a mud room, rest area, storage locker---and can also be used as an extra sleeping area, as the screened windows have zippered closures.  I would definately recommend a ground cloth (plastic tarp) under the tent and would suggest that one might want (in warm weather) to face the tent in the direction from which the wind is comming to add to the ventalation effect.  It took me abour 20 minutes to set this up by myself---and I also was able to get the rain fly on without assistance---just be sure you have a plan before you start and know which part faces the antiroom and which part covers the main body of the tent.  Though I have not been able to have it as nicely packed as when I received it new, I have been able to roll it up and fit it into the storage bag without difficulty.  I took this on several scout campouts with my son and it was great.  I would have liked to see more storage pockets and more loops for hanging in both sections of the tent---but one can't have everything.  For the price, this is an excellent value!",Great for a Scout Campout,True,
B002PB2HPS,5.0,"This is a really nice big tent with lots of room for two people. My wife and I had no problem setting it up in the dark and we enjoyed camping in it even though the temperature got down in the low 40s. It wasn't too warm inside but we had lots of room to bundle up. We look forward to using it when the weather gets warmer. Looks like a good spring-fall tent and maybe summer too. Will write more when we can.

B002PB2HPS,5.0,"We have used this tent twice now and everytime are astounded by the size.  There are just three of us (me, hubby & 3yo daughter PLUS 60lbs dog) and it is super spacious.  The front room is perfect for chairs / games / boots, etc.  The back room is big enough for two queen blow up matresses and then still two people in bags at their feet.  We had one queen mattress and our daughter slept on her sleeping bag pad.  Our friends who came with us piled their two kids in our tent as well (since it was so roomy) and still felt empty.  We are backpackers (8+ years) and have just recently started integrating some car camping into our weekends to spend time with friends who aren't too keen on carrying everything on their backs.  Going from our tiny, light backpacking tent to this huge tent is like having a small apartment in the woods.  We haven't tested it in the rain yet, but we have sealed all the seams just in case.  We have used it in the GA heat of August and it is really well ventilated.  Took about 20 minutes the first time to set up and less the second.  Once we get the hang of it, I think two people could probably set it up in about 10 minutes.  Considering its huge size it is somewhat large for a small tent pad in some campgrounds.

B002PB2HPS,5.0,"I purchased this tent for hot weather camping in Fl,Ga, and NC.The 3 sided screen room,mesh ceiling and large screen windows provide excellent ventilation! The rear of the tent has a 1.5 sq ft awning covered vent for circulation in rainy weather,that is not shown in any of the photos. The side poles are steel and the arched roof poles are fiberglass. I slept in this tent for 8 days in NC with no problems. On two nights it rained very hard and no leaks or water entered the tent! Setup takes me about 10 minutes by myself,takedown is longer as the tent must be folded and compressed to get it into the bag. This is the first tent I have ever managed to get back into the carry bag without a major ordeal of rolling and stuffing! The only shortcoming is that there is no power cord panel in the main room,so a cord must be run through the front door. Because of the screen ceiling the tent does not retain heat in cold weather,so this is definitely not a winter tent. I used an electric space heater during 40 degree nights and the interior would never heat over 15 degrees above the outside temperature.

Be sure to pull off the black nubs first and SAVE THEM. They have disc brakes and the wheel is relatively off center (it is wider on the disc side). Make sure to center the fender over the wheels otherwise it doesn't do its job. To get these on I needed to bend the stainless steel a little bit right near the part where it screws into the frame. Make small bends until you get it right. Don't over bend them back and forth. Stainless steel is VERY stiff and has no plasticity = it could potentially break off with a few bends. For the front I needed to use the L brackets for the forks as there was no direct mounts. I also needed to pick up some additional stainless hardware from a store. Once everything was securely mounted I trimmed off the excess stainless mounts with bolt cutters and put the black nubs to cap the jagged edge.

These are absolutely perfect on my 2014 Specialized Sirrus Comp Disc (I use them with either 700c x 28 or 700c x 30 tires) and they really look very nice.

I was surprised that I installed the rear fender so much easier than the front as the latter required the use of the spacers to make clearance for the front disc brake.  I had to remove the front wheel to align the front fender properly.

For the back, there was no need to remove the wheel.  There is no need for extra hands if you have a bike repair stand but it took me the better of an hour to set them up solidly with no rubbing on the tires and eliminate any noise.

The back one just ""piggy-backed"" on the same spacer that the rear bike rack required.  I also installed all the bolts for the rear fender making them very solid with no rattling or jiggling sound while I ride.

The mud flaps were extra features that the SpeedEZs did not have and the Cascadia actually made the bike cleaner looking.

The pics I have here shows how they were attached to the front wheel (with spacers), back wheel (""piggy-backed"" on the rear rack spacers.

You'll need to take off the wheels at some point, unless you have a lot of frame/tire clearance, too.

I did have to buy a longer bolt for where the front fender attaches to the bottom of the fork crown, but I might have a notably-thick fork.

B00474P0OQ,5.0,"I wanted to wait and see how these worked in wet conditions before writing a review.

I have a 2015 Specialized Crosstrail Disc, which has 38 mm width tires mounted on 700c wheels. These fenders are just barely wide enough for these tires, so I would definitely suggest a different fender if your tires are any wider than that.

The installation was not without issues. The rear fender went on easily enough, but the rubber caps could not be used on the rear-most stays, as they were barely long enough. Also, the plastic clip for the seat stay attachment point needed to be modified a little in order to bolt it on. The zip ties (included) would have been necessary to mount it high enough to get the required 5 mm clearance. That said, I really wanted to bolt it in place. Even with some ""dremelling,"" I didn't quite achieve that, but I was satisfied enough with it. Otherwise, the rear fender went on easily enough. Again, I want to emphasize that the manufacturer's specs could have been maintained using the included zip ties.

The front fender was another story. As the Crosstrail Disc obviously has disc brakes, the suspension fork doesn't have  mounting points for fenders. I had to fabricate some aluminum clamps to make mounting points at the fork.

Now for the bottom line. I was caught in the rain last Saturday, and the fenders were put to the test. I was most concerned about the performance of the front fender, and it worked beautifully. It made a world of difference. Of course, I still got wet, as it was raining! But at least the wetness came from above and I didn't get splashed from below.

B00474P0OQ,4.0,"These fenders look nice, seem sturdy, and do a great job of keeping me dry. I had a little trouble mounting them. The disc-brake stay extensions are way too long; they pull the fender off to one side if you use them as is.  I had to cut one if half with a hack saw to get a decent fit. Also the plastic stay release things on the front fender interfered with my fork so I needed to remove them. They were practically impossible to pull off by hand, making me wonder if they would actually release in an emergency as they're supposed to. Eventually, I wound up using a screw driver to press in some tabs to get them off and mounted the front stay in the traditional way.

Now that they're installed I really only have one complaint. The stay ends extend out past the fender and they're kind of ugly and snag on stuff if you're not careful.

I have no issues with toe clearance.  They look classy too; the finish doesn't look cheap and I've had a few compliments on how they look.

I commute year round in all weather, and after putting them on I immediately noticed that I could go farther between lubes.  While they do an excellent job of keeping my feet dry, somehow they still allow snow to cake up on my bottom bracket in bad weather.

B00474P0OQ,5.0,"For anyone wondering, these fender DO fit vintage Campy Record/Nuovo Record short reach brakes.  I also found that these fenders ""tune"" well to address inevitable tire rub.  Tighten the dropout eyelet screws and brake mount nut.  Loosen the nuts which attach the fender to the wire stays and manipulate the fender away from the tire.  You can increase or decrease the bow/arc of the fender.  To increase the bow/arc, tighten the rear and lift the middle with your hand and tighten at the desired arc.  To decrease, tighten the rear and push down on the top of the fender.  A second set of hands REALLY helps.

Compared to what's out there, these are the best.  Nice and light.  Do not expect these things to just snap on.  A fender has not yet been made that snaps into place and adjusts itself to the wide variety of tires/wheels/frames we ride.

1/27/14 UPDATE: Other reviewers have mentioned that these fenders are a bit ""flimsy"".  This is curable and the same method works on front and rear.  First, ensure the rear bolts holding the stays to the fender are tight.  Second, loosen the forward bolts and lift the fender just enough to put tension and a slight bow in the rear stays.  Tighten the forward bolts.  This creates a dynamic tension which dramatically stiffens the fender assembly.  I would be interested in hearing from others who give this fix a go.

B00474P0OQ,4.0,"I purchased these Planet Bike fenders to replace a set of aluminum Velo Orange fenders on my 54cm Soma ES.  I had several problems with VO fenders that I need not go into, but I should mention the general issues with aluminum fenders: the aluminum fenders and stays are easily bent in the event you kick them while pedaling or if you bump them against something.

The pros of these fenders:
- Well made!  Solid construction with quality materials
- In my opinion the directions were clear
- All needed hardware was included
- More durable because they flex rather than permanently bending when bumped
- The stainless steel stays are stronger and more resistant to being bent than aluminum ones
- The construction should minimize rattling

The cons of these fenders:
- Heavier than aluminum fenders due to the stainless steel stays
- The mud flaps arrived a bit warped out of the box.  Hopefully they straighten over time.
- The front fender has a slot cut in it that water can come through.  I taped over this from the underside of the fender
- The stays on the front fender were long enough to rub on the frame.  I'm not sure if this is a design flaw or if it's necessary to accommodate various frame/fork dimensions, but I had to cut the stays on the front fender.  The stays are made of a very strong stainless steel so this was a laborious process.  I tried using a hack saw but a dremel with cutting blade worked better.  The otherwise easy installation was dramatically lengthened by this process.

So far I quite like these fenders but I will update my review if that opinion changes.  I prefer them greatly to the Velo Orange fenders I had before.

B00474P0OQ,4.0,"Even though I like these fenders well enough to say that I would probably never consider trying a different fender, I can point out of couple of things I don't like about them.

I have these fenders on two bikes: a Surly Pacer and an old Santana tandem.  35mm and 45mm fender width, respectively.

Here's where things could be better.

First, the water that accumulates in the front fender cannot flow freely to exit either the top or the bottom of the fender.  This is because the metal tab thingies where the stays bolt on obstruct water flow inside the fender.  Water tends to dribble out at these locations (the two places where front fender is held to the stays).  And the front fender tab is a small problem for the same reason, there is a small hole there, allowing water to escape.  Solution for solving this problem is simple.  Apply duct tape (thin strips) to the inside of fender to help channel water over the obstructions in those particular locations.  I did this, and the duct tape has held for more than one season and solves the problem of water dribbling out of the front fender and onto my legs (due to riding fast and wind blowing).

Second, a very minor squabble, but it seems that the fenders are never perfectly straight.  The mudflap seems to be always at a slight angle, either left or right, even though the fender is mounted equidistant to the left and right all the way around.

But all in all I really like the fenders.  Sturdy enough, look good, and are very effective.",Would never buy a different fender (probably),False,

The front fender wasn't hard to install, and the bridge just fits over the front part of the center brake hole, so I had to remove my front wheel and release the front V-brake in order to slide the fender in the front. The mud flap and the fender stays do get in the way when I have to pedal and turn the front wheel but that is kind of expected with the fenders.

The rear fender was simpler to install but the kit included a short bolt for the rear brake bridge. It was too short to use a washer on both ends of that bolt, so the instructions only told you to use a washer for the bolt head and the nylock nut contacts the brake bridge directly. Luckily my aluminum bike frame isn't too expensive so I don't mind that. However, I think it is worth mentioning for those with expensive aluminum or carbon frames! A longer stainless bolt and extra washer would work though, or if you use cantilever/center mount brakes.

The polycarbonate fenders look kind of out of place on the bike, and the shiny stays also look out of place. The fenders tend to shake and wobble around when the bike hits bumpy surfaces. The alignment was difficult because if your tires wobble a little, and the fenders shake/wobble at the right moment, it might rub during normal use.
The rear fender is also supposed to clip onto the center part of the frame where a kickstand is usually bolted. I noticed that my bike frame has a threaded boss designed specifically for a fender, but this kit did not include a bolt or washer for this mount. As a result I had to use two nylon zip ties to secure the fender and keep it straight.

Overall: 4/5 stars, build quality is great but looks out of place on a white bike, and the installation is OK. I had some issues with alignment of both fenders, and the front fender can get in the way of my toe if I pedal and turn at low speeds. This is the price to pay if one desires to avoid getting grime  splashed on the back of a jersey/jacket or on your cycling tights.

****************

UPDATE 25 DEC 2012
After putting these fenders through some serious trials, I have to give them a thumbs up 5/5 star rating. Here's why:

After some adjustment of the stays, I found that bending them outwards (away from the fork or rear chain stays) provides some extra rigidity. In addition, lifting the rear mudflap portion away from the tire while tightening the stay adjustments will provide added clearance from the tire. This prevents excessive rubbing when the mudflap part of the fender flaps around during riding. This is the only part that tends to move about due to its distance from the brake bridge mount, resulting in the least rigid portion of the fender moving around.

The clearance between my toe and the front mudflap isn't the best, but not once did I have a serious problem even during tight turns. Unless you are turning very very tightly at a really slow speed, you shouldn't be turning the wheel that much - it's all about counter steering and leaning. I've only had my toe touch the flap a few times and the result was just a light thud and no ensuing drama.

I've tested these fenders in the rain, on wet pavement with puddles, ice, snow, mud, rocks, dirt roads, and off-roading. I took my hybrid bike onto an off-road area that was completely filled with frozen mud, gravel, and deep ruts. It felt like I was sitting on a jackhammer, but I wanted to test the sturdiness of these fenders. Not once did these fenders fly off or rub. Once I went back on smooth tarmac, I checked the fenders out and they looked good as new. I did not see any splatter on my cycling tights or cycling jacket. The bike stayed mostly clean.

Splashing through puddles will result in some splatter on the lower tube and possibly your shoes due to the front tire displacing the water/mud. But the fenders do a great job reducing this splatter.

The only drawback is that I do notice some aerodynamic drag and the extra weight is somewhat noticeable.","Had minor issues with installation, but quality is great!!",True,2
B00474P0OQ,5.0,"I've had these a month now, I have yet to ride in a downpour but have ridden a few sprinkles /puddles here and there and they do a nice job.

I also ride crushed stone path about 10 miles daily commute and these have cut down on the amount of dust on my chain, but not as much as I hoped they would (of course not their intended purpose, just my wishful thinking!).

Fit my 700x35's with plenty of room to spare. I think they will also fit 700x40 studded winter tires (bike is a Cannondale t2)

My only complaint, and it is minor, is I wish they weren't quite so shiny... but otherwise I love them. Will be adding a set to my winter beater bike too this year.",Work great so far!!,True,
B00474P0OQ,5.0,"I put these fenders on a 2010 Trek 520. My tire size is 700 x 32. The black goes well with the overall bike design. I currently use my bike primarily for daily commuting (16 mi. round trip) and day trips 20-70 miles. I am trying to get it geared up for overnights as well.

I think these are an important addition to any commuting or touring bike. Before I purchased these, I had half fenders on both the front and back of my bicycle and they were very ineffective. I would still get spray in my face from the front tire, and spray on my trunk bag from the rear tire. After installing these and riding in the rain, I am pleased with their overall effectiveness.

In addition to protecting me from road spray during inclement weather, they also protect my frame from rocks/pebbles on a daily basis. I haven't heard a single ping off of my down tube since installing them.

You need the correct crescent/hex wrenches to install these. Installation isn't 'difficult' per say, but it is definitely time consuming. You have to tweak/tighten the bolts just right to get the fenders to sit proportionally symmetric (or is it symmetrically proportionate?) around your tires. I don't remember the installation length exactly, but I think it was roughly three episodes of Breaking Bad worth of time spent in the living room fiddling with them.

I would definitely recommend these to a friend. If you are a busy person or don't have access to the correct tools, it might be worth having them installed at a bike shop. I'm giving these 5 stars, because I don't mind if a product requires a little elbow grease to get right, as long as when it is setup it works great. I would categorize these as such. However, they lose half a letter grade for the extra effort required, A- overall.",Lightweight & Effective,True,

WELL YOU BETTER. There is literally nothing you can't do with para-cord, it's like the duct-tape of strings.

The possibilities are endless, which you recognize immediately upon opening the packaging. First of all, don't even TRY to put this stuff back into the bag it came into, you'll quickly realize it'll become a tangled mess and you'll never be able to use it again without setting your house on fire. If only there was a way to weave the paracord into an easily store-able ...OH WAIT THERE IS, THE PARACORD DONUT!

Now you'll never have to worry about it knotting up and LIFE WILL BECOME EASY MODE. You have to wonder why the retailers don't sell the stuff like that already?

So you've got your sweet p-cord donut and are now ready to conquer the world. What can you do?  ANYTHING YOU WANT.

Sweet para-cord survival bracelets 24/7, hell, you can even make a cute pink and red anklet for your girlfriend for Valentine's day. Oh, you don't have a girl friend? YOU'RE BETTER OFF.  You don't need a frickin' girlfriend and if anything that just means you have more money to spend on para-cord and more time to weave awesome creations with it.

Had a few glasses of Jack Daniels and were browsing the online gun forums which made you decide to try weaving for the first time in your life to make a sling for your AK-47? This is exactly what you want. Get that sling all complete and then realize that you forgot to put sling adapters on and have weaved the sling directly onto the rifle's sling swivels, so you can't remove it without completely undoing your creation? NO TURNING BACK NOW, IT'S ALREADY PERFECT.

They say the rules require your shotgun has to have a sling on it to use it in the match, but you have no sling adapters on it? JUST MAKE THEM OUT OF PARA-CORD, AND THEN WIN THE MATCH LIKE A BOSS. Flawless victory.

Friend's got an old Willy's Jeep and you want to secure some sweet WWII gear it to before cruising out to the beach? THIS STUFF IS PERFECT FOR THAT.

Need a redundant system to make sure the forged aluminum 1913 pica-tinny rail attachments don't one day magically fail and cause your AN/PEQ box and optics to fall into the depths of hell? JUST ADD SOME PARA-CORD AND NOW YOU GOT A TRUE OPERATOR'S RIFLE.

I will compare it to other scopes costing two to three times as much (or ten times).  I can't tell the difference on the lower power settings up to about 6x.  Most hunters will never be able to either. 100 yards, spot on, this scope dialed right in with very little adjustment.  Lets be honest, you read all about 1/2 inch groups at 500 yards, yadda yadda yadda blah blah blah.  What you need is to be able to do is be dead on a target at 100 yards and hit a paper plate at 200 yards.  If you can do that, there is food on the table.  $45 here, plus a nice little Marlin X7 for about $299 (.270 or .308), you have a deadly combination that will perform admirably.","On the Lower power settings, the difference is marginal",True,8

I first bought a $180 Bushnell in silver. When it came I was pretty upset because right out of the box it was just horrible. It looked like someone spray painted it. Fit and finish were horrible, even though the lenses were great.

Its hit or miss trying to line up the extended pin that comes with it and the pin is prone to mushrooming after tapping on it trying to tweak one that won't quite line up right. I ended up gluing it in place on my permanent Glock 17 and 19 and this works just fine. Also I think if you file down the back of the plastic on the Grip force grip a little it may give you that extra millimeter you will so desperately fight for. Once mounted it gives me a much more "" 1911"" style feel ( although not completely the same angle) and ZERO Glock bite. If they would find a solution to the mounting issue I would give it 5 stars.","Very good adaptor to prevent ""Glock bite""",True,

B004VIZN90,5.0,Great product!  It comes two to a pack and has 4 longer pins.  One for the wife and one for me...Happy wife happy home!  It forces the hand to hold it the same way so...it does improve accuracy a little more.  My hands are large so it helped bring the pad of the index finger right on trigger.  The pin is hard to seat but I used a clamp to bring the pin the rest of the way through.  Then I slipped the Houge grip over to smooth out the ridge and increase the palm swell.,Best thing to prevent web bite!,True,
B004VIZN90,5.0,"This is a really nice mod for the Glock.  Its looks good and for me, makes the grip even better.

Installation was easier than expected.  Simply remove the pin in the grip put the beaver tail in place and replace the pin with the one provided.  Shouldn't take more than 2 minutes to install.
This beaver tail does change the point angle of the pistol a little.  A little bit less of that funky European feel and adds a bit of traditional Smith feel to the weapon.
All and all I found this to be a great product that seems to be holding up well.

Now the cons
1. for me at least it adds about a quarter of an inch from the front to back which puts my finger at a different position on the trigger
2. I cant get as deep into the beavertail as id like too it feels to me that some material could be remove to achieve a deeper grip.

B004VIZN90,5.0,"Like all aftermarket products they are never perfect, this one comes pretty close. The good first, comes with two great adapters with two distinct feels. I like them both for different reasons. The fit is excellent though some have complained about sanding/fitting issues. I did not have any, but this is a minor issue if you experience it trimming with an x-acto knife, sanding with some fine grit or even heating up with a heat gun is a minor inconvenience. For those who are concerned with 'slide-bite' injuries this is by far the least expensive/best mod you can make. It also adds a bit more material to the overall thickness of the grip so if you have large hands and feel the factory grip is small this may help you.

Down side from what I can tell is that I'd prefer a steel retaining pin vs. the plastic/polymer one they give you. I would gladly pay the extra $1 or so for that added margin of reliability whether actual or perceived.  Other than that is seems like a good value and I would recommend it.

It has worked very well to help me get a solid grip when drawing the pistol from concealment.  I'll probably end up installing one on each of my carry Glocks.

One small ""gripe"" is the (longer) replacement pin is rather cheap ""plastic/polymer"".  I broke the first one trying to get it in (you get a spare).

B004VIZN90,5.0,"this would be well worth your money even without the beaver tail portion. it changes the grip angle so that you can get good contact on the rear of the grip with the webbing between your thumb and index finger. cheapest and least invasive approach to grip angle adjustments. only people that may not like this are those that have a hard time already wrapping their hands around the glock grip because it will add a millimeter or two from the frontstrap to backstrap measurement. i have the smaller smooth surfaced one on my glock 27 gen3 as well, i just counted up 5 rows of texturing and cut it with thin wire cutters then filed the rough edges and my baby glock now fits like a glove.

a note for gen4 owners. if you don't have a gen 3 as well that can take advantage of the extra adapter that comes in the package, i would suggest getting the gen 4 adapter if you already use the medium backstrap as this will mimic the same overall dimensions if there were a #2 backstrap installed. if you are using the gen3 adapters in combo with the medium backstrap you may want to heat up the adapter right before you put it on - mine was a very hard fit and i don't know if it was just the fact that i had talon grips underneath it, but i would still try heating it up to get it pliable for a first install

oh yea, and i don't get slide bite anymore from a sloppy unholster grip when i practice drawing",changes grip angle on my gen4 w/ medium backstrap,True,
B004VIZN90,5.0,There will be an occasion when your grip is slightly off resulting in a nasty cut that will ruin you day. An ounce of prevention...,Lifesaver,True,
B004VIZN90,4.0,"I really like this product. I didn't buy it to prevent slide bite or to reduce muzzle flip. I bought it to counteract the improper grip angle that Glocks have. That alone was worth paying this much for 15 cents worth of plastic. The fact that it does significantly tame muzzle flip is a huge bonus, too.

The install was so easy a 5 yr old could do it. After installing it, I noticed the first issue with the design. The pin extends too far out and makes the grip uncomfortable. Luckily, that was an easy fix. I just pushed it in flush on one side and used a Dremel to flush the other side...problem solved.

The other design flaw is almost a ""no go"", however. Those ridiculous long ribs on the underside of the beavertail ripped my thumb to shreds right at the 2nd distal joint. I've devoted quite a few hundred hours developing muscle memory to go changing my grip. So, out comes the Dremel again. It took quite a while to neatly remove those ridges and polish it up. This considerably weakened the plastic too, but at least it doesn't leave me bloody anymore.

Overall, I'd give this product a solid 10 for the general concept and installation ease, but I'd only give it a 3 or 4 on design execution. Yet still, I still highly recommend it to my friends. Everyone who's taken my advice thank me. They love it too.","It'd be perfect, if...",False,

Put them on with no problem, and even gave one to another buddy since it came with 2 of them.

It went on with only a little effort. It is definitely hard to put on but I'm talking about something that takes about three minutes to do. It's three minutes that you start feeling like it's not going to go on and then suddenly it's on.
This adapter causes a drastic change in the grip, it feels physically larger but I also feel more confident that I'm not going to ever get bit by that slide again.
Either get this or a Crimson Trace laser grip, the CT Grips do the same thing as I had it on my old glock 22 RTF2. I hated the texture on that gun.
You will be extremely happy with this as I am. I put it on and played with it a while and then installed the Pachmayr tactical slip on grip and it feels super different. It's something I'm going to have to get used to but I must say that although my grips definitely feel really large in my hands, I can still hold my glock and shoot it with ease and it is extremely comfortable.

To ne approximate, you can get 5 full magazines out of the gun before needing a CO2 change which is not to bad honestly just buy a lot of CO2. Also, yes its blowback and kicks like a baby mule, very accurate with the heavier the round. ***Yes the orange tip is on the gun when it arrives, however it is removable easily, you will need a lighter and pliers, start by locking the slide back the heating the tip of the barrel with the lighter for 30-40 seconds, heat the end of the metal barrel, not tee actual orange tip, the grip the orange tip woth the pliers and twist it comes off super quick and yes can be placed on the gun when needed, their are threads inside the barrel for attachments.*** One more thing, the gun does not have a rail and is a 1:1 scale functioning airsoft replica and is a full size colt 1911. And for the fps geeks, it fires close to 370 or 380 for .25 believe it pr not, how about buy it and find out for yourself, and yes its 2.15 pounds which is close to the real weight. Once again this gun is te best CO2 airsoft replica since its affordable and an all around fun firearm. Enjoy abd remeber to always wear eye protection if you are using it in a live airsoft match, no matter if it is an unofficial or official match.

B0055RTHWK,5.0,"Simply awesome. This is a realistic airsoft gun. It feels great in hand and is very well made. I wanted something with the look and feel of the classic 1911 and I got it.

Shooting it is fun. It is very powerful and accurate - and loud.

Loading it is a bit of a chore, more akin to loading a real semiautomatic handgun, but I don't mind.

Easy to store with CO2 in the mag. I take out the mag and dry fire and put them away disassembled.",Looks great and so much fun,True,
B0055RTHWK,5.0,"Excellent airsoft pistol. I use it in my basement for indoor target practice. Not the most accurate, but very fun to shoot. Disassembles exactly like a real 1911 for easy cleaning/maintenance. The magazine is a little tricky to load but feels very sturdy.

B0055RTHWK,5.0,"It took what felt like an eternity to get this pistol, as they're sold out nearly everywhere, and for a good reason. This beauty weighs in at 2Lbs, and looks (and feels) insanely real. To remove the orange cap, use pliers to carefully grip the cap, and slowly rotate the cap counter clockwise, applying moderate pressure. The cap will loosen and then screw off, and can be screwed back on if needed. When filming outside of a designated airsoft range, be sure to ask your local police department where and when you may film, and let them know your gear is very convincing looking. You may need to schedule (and pay) an officer to oversee the filming (isn't it sad if you don't have a badge and squad car, people freak out?). Be responsible, and keep in mind dry firing can/may damage the internals over extended use. If you plan to actually target shoot in your back yard, be sure to ask your neighbors if they are okay with it, and again, alert the police that you will be using a CO2 pistol during that time. One last note: don't contact the police via 911; that's for emergencies only. Your local PD will have a number listed in your phone book. Good shooting, and be safe!","Worth Every Penny, and the Wait",True,69.0
B0055RTHWK,4.0,"As pictured, the 1911 has trademarks and is all metal. My only complaint is that it is a hassle to load and the magazine is single-stack. Overall worth the money for people looking for a mean field-ready Airsoft gun or for collectors who can't afford a real-steel one.","As pictured, the 1911 has trademarks and is all ...",True,
B0055RTHWK,4.0,"This is overall a very good gun. But, a few things keep it from being perfect.

Pros:
-Great weight, 2.15 pounds.

-Powerful. This gun is easily able to go through both sides of a can

-fun to shoot. This is a given for a blowback, but I just love the feeling of the side moving back.

Cons:

-Uses lots of co2. In averaged 3 and 1/2 mags per co2 canister

-Very hard to load. It is difficult to load each mag, because the bbs tend to stick to the opening of the mag and the spring is very resistant. Because of this, it is necessary to buy another mag, which you can get on amazon for $28. This gun is compatible with KWA mags, which is good.

Other than that, this is a great gun, but in my opinion, the best co2 airsoft pistol on the market is the black ops 2.5 in revolver. This gun is not available  on amazon, but can be bought on ebay. While some people may not want a revolver, I love it because it is more accurate, powerfull, thrifty on co2, and in my opinion, better made. Not only that, but since it's a revolver, it lasts forever and has never nor will ever jam on me. They cost $50-$80, so they are cheaper as well. For those who want a blowback instead of a revolver, this is an excellent gun. But for those who want the best co2 airsoft pistol available, than the black ops 2.5 inch co2 revolver is the way to go.",Good gun with a few flaws,True,5.0

B0055RTHWK,5.0,"Arrived today, must say right off the bat that I love this weapon. For the following reasons, feels great in my hand, nice finish, action is very smooth and last but not certainly least is it fits in the leather holster that I purchased for another 1911, that did NOT fit. Now I have a authentic looking 1911 Pistol, Flap Style Military Holster, Belt and Double Magazine Holder and the entire rig is made out of leather. This should get some stares when I'm out on the Field of Battle (Air Soft).",must say right off the bat that I love this weapon,False,
B0055RTHWK,5.0,"I love all the realistic features on this pistol!
The grip safety and single action hammer and that trigger!
And it even field strips correctly!
I have two and hundreds of rounds later,still hitting hard and shooting straight.
It really will go through the co2,doing about 75 rounds per canister(four good mags easily).
But for how hard it kicks back and how heavy and metallic it is,you'll let it spit all the co2 it wants.
Has adjustable hop up and slide locking magazine.
The only Con to this whole system is buying new mags,they are costly and buying the wrong one is easy to do.
But they are metal and rugged and drop out nicely.
I got these for mil-sim sidearms,and they fit the bill right out of the box.

B0055RTHWK,4.0,"The Colt 100th Anniversary Airsoft Pistol is a good looking variation of the real thing.  The pistol closely resembles an early style 1911, except for the orange barrel extension that protrudes from the front.  I tried to remove the orange extension and could not.

The slide racks back like a real 1911, and the hammer falls to fire a pellet.  The slide action does not load a round, nor does it appear to have any real function, as the inserted loaded magazine is sufficient to chamber a round.

You can't manually drop the hammer after firing when a CO2 cartridge is inserted.  The gun has to live ""cocked and locked.""  Firing it is fun and it will fire fairly quickly until the magazine is empty.  Accuracy is fair, at best.",Nice Looking,True,

B0055RTHWK,5.0,"This is truly an amazing toy. I cant believe how far airsoft has come after looking at this airsoft pistol.

The orange tip is threaded therefore it's twist off, which makes it easy for removal but I'd recommend keeping it on there just because people may mistake it for the real steel.

All functions on the pistol work like the real gun, it's absolutely incredible. Buy this right now!!",INCREDIBLE!!!!,True,
B0055RTHWK,4.0,"This one is a good simulation to the colt 100th model. The trigger pull is really light and the safe is better to be turned on whenever you don't shoot with it. The gun is made of metal, which makes it is in a good weight.
However, there are some flaws in terms of the design. First of all, the hop-up is too strong, which makes the BBs keep curving up within 20 feet. If go far away, probably more accurate. Even if I adjusted the hop-up to its weakest level, it still has this issue. Another thing is that the CO2 runs out quite fast. I remember only 1-2 magazines will be possible before you run out the 1 cartridge. The major reason is that when it blowsback everytime, I could feel that the CO2 is leaking toward face. Such experience is definitely a flaw.",Great gun,True,6.0
B0055RTHWK,4.0,"Pros:
1: feels and weighs like real 1911.
2: very smooth blow-back.
3: surprisingly powerful.
4: accurate with both 12g and 20g.
5: takes apart easily.
6: extremely real mechanism workings.
7: with 12g rounds it shoots 460-500 fps and lowers as the Co2 lowers(obviously)
8: with 20g rounds it shoots 400-450 fps and lowers as the Co2 lowers(obvious once again)

Cons:
1: uses up TONS of Co2.
2: you can only shoot 5 magazines(4 w/15 rounds, and 1 w/7-10 rounds) before you need to change out the Co2.
3: the sights are not easy to see.",Excellent pistol!,True,3.0
B0055RTHWK,5.0,"I have owned and fired a number of Colt 1911's.  This is a great working replica of a great pistol.  The weight is perfect and all of the controls work as on the original. It really feels like a Colt 1911. It even takes down like the original. Accuracy is quite adequate for realistic combat target practice. At 7 yards I can cover my groups with my fist. I haven't really tried for target accuracy, but I suspect at moderate ranges it will do as well as any stock 1911. The only thing missing is the kick of a .45, but that's pretty much as expected.  The reciprocating slide gives you the feel of a .22. If you're looking for something to practice with indoors or in your back yard, this is just the ticket.",Great working replica,True,4.0
B0055RTHWK,5.0,"The look, weight, and feel of this airsoft gun is spectacularly close to the original. The kick of the blowback is quite strong and required adjustments to my firing stance and grip for the sake of accuracy.  The grip safety is another plus and the slide remaining full back and open after the last round is very close to the true operation of a 1911 Colt. Only complaint I have is the magazine loading. The spring does not have a lock when fully compressed and therefore loading the BBs is a real three-hand operation. Do not use cheap BBs as they might jam. I use .28g aluminum BBs and they are fairly accurate for a 4"" group. The grips are a little bland so I'm shopping for a pair of nice walnut grips. I highly recommend this gun to anybody particular about the look and feel of a replica. Oh, and take those stickers off the slide.",The best 1911 Blowback Pistol IMHO,True,7.0

B005F5JJGQ,5.0,"This bag is very roomy, holds it's shape well, looks good, and is well made.  I like it on the handlebar of my mountain bike.  I have another one mounted to the seat of a road bike, but it swings back and forth a little more than I would like.  But it is very handy in either case.","Handy, nice looking bag.",True,
B005F5JJGQ,4.0,"It has a stiff plastic liner that keeps the cylindrical shape. In a way this is very good because it adds weather protection especially from the front. However the ends do not have a stiff plastic circle which would make this very weather resistant and almost weather perfect. Even so it's pretty good. Nice low cost and quick shipping.
I am using this now on a secondary bicycle of mine. Yes, like another reviewer stated it is hard to reach for the right item in this bag though that has some assets as well because it makes it more difficult for a sneak thief (though it would be pretty easy for a thief to just unbuckle this and take the whole thing (that would be quickly noticed though).It's small enough that you can easily unbuckle and take with you if you are worried about theft.
Enough space for bike tools and some spare inner tubes or whatever you desire that fits in this.
The stitching on this bag is excellent, superb really  and the zippers are of very good quality.
For the price still it's a good buy.
I measured the diameter and it is not quite 5 inches in diameter (outside measurement).Vertically on the bag end I measured 5 inch but from horizontal measurements in width from outside measurements it's more like 4 and a half inches. So it's more like 4 and 3/4 inches in diameter on average from outside measurements and a little less than that on the inside.
I had originally purchased this item to place my new Ping 24 volt 10 AH Lithium Ion battery and controller with switch for my electric motorized bike in this but it just wouldn't fit although close. Had it been a true 5 inches in diameter it should have fit. Yes I cut the outside end part carefully to fit the battery in.

The bag is big enough to carry tools and two tubs plus lunch or a first aide kit. The interior is just one big space so you may want to put tubes in something protective.

B005KW6OS0,4.0,"I bought this after hearing about it on Tom Gresham's radio show.  It is from a very respected firearms company, Ruger, so I had great expectations.  I bought this for my wife, as she has decided against carrying a concealed handgun for the time being.  It could be really effective, but with two considerations.

1.  You need to spend some time reading the instructions and practicing the ""draw"", as it is not very intuitive.  To this end, it would be helpful to have some ""dummy"" cartridges for practice, as once you pull the protective tapes, it is armed.  Because of the non-intuitive nature of the draw, periodic practice is a good idea, too.

2.  I don't see any provision for replacement cartridges or other parts.  I guess if you use it, you'll probably not mind buying a new one.

B0063NCDLM,5.0,"I've had this for a year now, overall very satisfied with it.  I use it every 2 or 3 days for 30-60 minutes each time...non-stop succession of a variety of exercises, I run through somewhere around 20 different exercises.  Very smooth movement...gym quality feel.
**This equipment is not for 'getting huge', but it will definitely build muscle.  It's for increasing strength and tone, through a huge variety of exercises, in your home...it's excellent for that. Small footprint, and not too tall for a normal room.  A lot of functional trainers and cable crossovers are too tall for a normal ceiling height, which is another reason I opted for this model.
The weights can get a little light for some movements after a while -- I just slow down and increase the reps. It's all about time on the muscle.
Assembly was very straight forward, a little time consuming, but nothing mechanically challenging. *tip: don't over tighten the pulleys or you'll create drag/friction...they need to spin freely*
Delivery was quick, no damaged or missing parts.  I ordered a couple of extra accessories (a triceps rope, a straight bar, and a bent bar), to bump up my exercise options.  With the adjustable post locations, and a couple of accessories, there are plenty of exercises to change up your workouts.
As far as maintenance, just have to occasionally lube the pulleys, which are all exposed and easy to get to. After a year, the cables are in solid shape, no issues.  Only thing I've had to do besides the pulleys is tighten some slack in the cables, which stretched a little bit after the first couple of weeks.
Bottom line, this is an excellent, very affordable, home-sized piece of equipment, smooth movement, with a huge number of exercises, and plenty of resistance to gain/maintain strength, and tone. People reviewing negatively complaining about the weights not being heavy enough should not have bought this model in the first place.  My experience with the purchase/shipment, etc., was very good.

On that note I do think if you are used to doing a lot of weight this may not work for you.  I'm 150 lbs and I can use all but three of the plates single handed.  If you're a big buy you're going to run out of weight quick.  Also the weight is split between the cables so if you two hand it it's even less.

Trick is to use plenty of lubricant and you can re-use the lubricant by placing a pan (bread pan) under the club to catch the lubricant dripping off the grip area. One review mentioned that there was not enough lubricant. Theres plenty if you re-use it.,Economical option,True,

B007AOAN3S,5.0,"I got these as a gift from my wife (via Amazon) after complaining about my worn out club grips.... These made my game so much better since I could grip the clubs finally. The biggest part of the job is removing the old grips. I used a hook blade from the local hardware store, a hairdryer, and some mineral spirits soaked cloth to remove some of the remaining glue from the shaft. After removing the mineral residue on all of the clubs and ensuring they are clean, then the easy part is next... re-gripping.  Get the club in the vice with provided club clamp (tight but not too tight), club strait up, wrap the club with provided double sided tape (make sure you over lap on the end of the club shaft at least a 1/4 inch and there are no creases or bubbles), remove the other side of the double sided tape, fold the excess tape into the shaft or smooth down (it makes the grip slide on easier). Now for the solvent spray part I used a paint pan under the taped end and it worked great. spray the tape pretty liberally, and spray the inside of the grip (use your thumb to cap the end hole or you will get the solvent on you. Then slide the grip (Dri-Tac logo up) over the taped shaft (use a paper towel or rag over the end hole so you don't get sprayed with solvent) and keep sliding the grip over the shaft. It should go pretty easy, if it doesn't apply more spray (only had to do it once). once it is all the way on give a little twist to ensure the grip tape is coated, and grip is upright and positioned right. Take the club out give it a tap on the bottom and set to the side to let it dry grip end up. That's it! And now its the waiting game. After an overnight dry The solvent evaporates and they are ready to play.  I never ran out of spray and I put the overflow from the paint pan back into the bottle (I know you can use odorless mineral spirits, but I didn't have that issue of running out. Since I have a few more grips left in case I need them, but after playing with them and testing them all, the grips are not coming off.

B007AOAN3S,4.0,"The grips were perfect for regripping clubs.  The tape was also very good and no problems attaching to the shaft on installation.  The liquid solvent was very good but would not be enough for doing all 13 clubs.  I bought a can of mineral oil from local hardware store to have enough for the job.

Some basic instructions would have been nice in the kit.  I went to watch several good videos online that carried me through the job.  I ruined the first two grips learning to do this job.  Problem was I was not being aggressive enough on installing the new grip after stripping old grip, cleaning the shaft, installing the tape and slathering on solvent.

B007H96JBQ,4.0,"i get comments on this bottle from everyone at the office. it's a pretty cool design (even if one guy mistook it for a bong lol).

the bottle itself is plastic, and little flimsier than i expected, but i think it'll last just fine. it needs flex so you can lock the charcoal into place.

the peg at the top leaks ever so slightly, so you don't want to carry it around upside-down. but you won't be in trouble if it gets knocked over or sits on it's side for a while.

also worth noting is the bottom of the bottle is too wide for most car cup holders. i can kinda squeeze the thing into the door panel of my car, but it's not really something you can easily use while driving since you have to manage the cork.

overall i'm very happy with the bottle, and the water tastes great! they recommend letting water sit in there for at least an hour and up to 8 hours for max filtration effect. plus this thing just looks too cool to pass on!","interesting water bottle, catches lots of attention",True,
B007H96JBQ,5.0,"Bought this bottle because of the minimalistic design and I have to say this is awesome. Now everybody that sees my bottle asks me where did I got it, looks so cool etc.
The carbon filter CHANGES the taste of the water you put in it, not sure sure if it filters it but definitively changes the flavor of the water and makes it less plain.

This is an important part because it allows ventilation and prevents the glasses from fogging. So now I need new ones, but it appears in the photos that the design changed to an integral bridge. If that's true, I expect these to last much longer than my first pair, which, other than the bridge issue, are perfectly good after a couple of years of use and abuse.

B007JZ3VA0,5.0,"Thirteen years ago, I had Lasik corrective eye surgery which gave me 20-20 distance vision.  At the time, I, also, got a pair of  prescription glasses for reading, which since then has been replaced many times over with simple readers.  After retiring, I decided I wanted to learn to work with wood, so I am taking a cabinet making class at the local community college, where we are required to wear safety glasses when working in the shop.

Soon I found my work was being slowed down by having to change to my ""readers"" every time I needed to read something or work on something up close.  I had found 3M's safety glasses to be a good fit for work with sidewalk trimmers, etc., and I even wore them in the shop.  So, I gave these a shot, choosing the 2.0 magnification because I wanted to be able to look at things clearly, yet, not have to hold things too close to my face.

These safety glasses are terrific!  And, after using them for over two months, I have found them to be comfortable with the soft rubber cushions across the top of the glasses and behind the ears; I have actually found them to be clear as my ""glass"" readers, if not clearer;  and, they stay attached to the padded cord I use to hang them around my neck.

If I wouldn't get weird looks, I'd wear them all the time, but you know being married, I can't always do what I'd like to do.

Since my ""glass"" readers tend to last only a month at best, I bought a second pair, but even though I've lost one pair of ""glass"" readers and broken a second pair of ""glass"" readers since I've have been using these safety glasses, my safety glasses are as good as the day I bought them.  I would suggest you rinse them regularly with clean water and wipe them dry using a clean cotton handkerchief.  Additionally, I would suggest you take the soft cushioned nose pads off, put a little glue on the hard plastic pieces that hold the cushioned nose pads, and put the soft cushioned nose pads back on the glasses.  My only problem I've had with them is I've lost a couple of those cushioned nose pads.  You can still wear the glasses, but they are more apt to slide down your nose a little.",As Good As Any Readers I've Ever Had,True,13.0

B008KEDZC8,4.0,"Are you going to use this for heavy rope a lot? OK, get it. If your needs will be served by smaller diameter rope, or you are going to be climbing with it, keep in mind it takes to up a lot of space on inside, or rattles on the outside of your pack, and weighs a lot.  If the bearings were stronger, it would support even more weight.
From my perspective: Worth the weight for a fixed application, but then, if weight is no object, you could buy something better in steel, perhaps for more money. For climbing: Too big, too fat, too heavy, unless you need it, in which case, it's a good price.","Big, Bulky, Heavy, handles big rope",True,

B009D1RYQU,4.0,"So far, this thing has been great.  Very pliable, so it folds up nicely for storage.  I'd advise against bending or folding it long-ways, however...it would develop a crease that I believe would reduce its lifespan.

It is a bit difficult to fill from a stream, so I use a water bottle to scoop-and-pour into the bag.  I also don't see a whole lot of uses in the ""carrying handle"" that it has.  With water in the bag, it just feels as though it would rip off at any time, so I don't use it.

Basically, I use this bag in conjunction with the Sawyer Mini Water Filter as it screws right on this bag perfectly.  I can fill it up and attach the Sawyer whenever I need some filtered water.  When it's time to leave, I can dump it out, roll it up, and pack it out.

It's only been used on a couple of outings so far, but it was used heavily and it's not showing any signs of creasing or cracking.  I will say that I've taken quite good care of it also though.  It is not very heavy material and could be punctured pretty easily if dropped or set on a sharp object when full of water.  It might even make sense to keep it in a half-gallon ziploc bag if you're concerned with that.

That seemed high to me, so I came home, checked out Amazon and came across these for nearly 1/3 the price with free Prime delivery via UPS.  You can't beat the price, for sure.

As for the weights themselves, they are a little too short and the bar is a little too big around, but certainly not enough to be a deal-breaker for the casual user.  I'm 72 and just wanted something for a light arm workout, and these are perfect for that purpose.  The design could be a tad bit better, but for the price I'm not complaining.

The tent stakes are terrible, so be sure to purchase something better (4 required) before taking this out. During our most recent trip, we found that one of the main poles had split, so this tent will likely be retired before the next trip. For a $33 purchase, this has performed exceptionally well.","Decent tent, limited lifespan",True,2

(2013 review of earlier, blue model)

UPDATE: After a season of bike touring, the only issue I had with the previous model of this tent was that a little water would leak in through the door zipper if it rained long enough and hard enough. Nothing major, but an annoyance nonetheless. When I saw that this updated tent included a zipper flap to mitigate the problem, I snatched it up right away, since I had been so happy with the tent otherwise. After several uses so far this season--which included a couple of rainstorms--I am happy to report that the small addition of the rain flap over the zipper did the trick... there has not been a drop of rain inside yet. As before, I am extremely satisfied with this tent and recommend it highly as a great value for the money.

Two poles are fed through long fabric loops instead of multiple snap loops and the fabric hangs up the poles sometimes. This tent goes up if you're alone and is a breeze with two people but it's a hassle the first try, like any other, so get it popped out in the yard before you go anywhere. The rain fly might leave a spot or two open if you have the vents open in hard rain so be careful how you orient your tent to the wind, tree cover and ground slope, how you pitch and tarp covers you hang, etc etc. Just like any other tent, you will get wet in your own condensation and humidity, especially with another person inside while sleeping (three is simply not comfortable at all, ever, sorry!).

Would recommend getting better stakes if in a windy area as the stock stakes are a bit flimsy and will not hold your tent down. cannot speak for it's water resistance.

B00A8E47O8,5.0,"After ordering this product, I found that the borrowed tent that I have been using for years is also a Wenzel (more than 10 year old, now discontinued product, mostly used in different desert changing weathers). This one is a bit smaller that the one I have been using and the design is also different. But now both have proved its reliability.
Wenzel service is good, I was able to get new fiber tent poles for the old tent (had to go by size not by model as that one is now out of their databases). I left it unsecured in the middle of a day storm with lots of wind that made it roll several yards while I was trekking somewhere else, with the new poles is as good as new.

Now talking about this product specifically. It is easier to stand out (I did not read the instructions on this one or the old one the first time I used it), not a four seasons tent, you would freeze in winter; it is a backpacking tent after all, with focus on light. With good sleeping bags and a space blanket just in case I would not hesitate to take this the rest of the year.
It comes with two sets of two poles each, two to support the structure and two to give it shape. It comes with a rain cover that have not used in the new tent, but looks and feels like the one in the old tent and that one kept me dry on several rain nights.
In comes with a nice nylon bag, with carrying handles, will have to find a way to secure it to the outside of my regular backpack.
The metal stakes to secure the tent are nothing to brag about, they are the kind of light thin stakes to be found on regular backpacks. It may require some good thinking to secure it but if it is well secure and the stakes don't hold, remember this is a backpacking tent, you don't want to ride a storm in it (yet I have with the old tent).",Excellent beginner tent,False,
B00A8E47O8,4.0,"Bought this tent for my son for Christmas to use on his Boy Scout camp outs (instead of borrowing mine).
We took the tent for a camp out this week-end with me and my 2 sons. The tent held 3 comfortably, though next time, I'll put myself in the middle and the boys can have the sides next to the wall.
On the camp out, we endured a severe thunderstorm with some of the heaviest rains I can remember, high winds, and hail. We sloshed through 3/4 inch of water during the rain, despite being on an incline. We waited out the storm under a pavilion and watched as many people's tents blew down or collapsed under the heavy rain.
This little tent held up perfectly well. After the rain died down, I checked the tent and it was still standing strong and was mostly dry inside. My ""mostly dry"" I mean that the zipper and possibly the corner seams leaked VERY SLIGHTLY under the torrential rain. My sons and I brought in more water on our clothing than what had leaked in.
Overall, this tent outperformed my expectations.

Update: Survived 2 Storms
My son took this tent on a scouting trip to the beach. The weather did not treat them well as they faced constant heavy rain and 30-50MPH winds. My son said that ""the wind turned it into a one-man tent"" as he described how the tent was squished down due to the strong winds. The tent sprung back to normal shape as the wind died down, so no damage was done. Most of the other tents were broken or otherwise flattened and filled with water by mid-week when the troop abandoned camp and came home. This tent held up and stayed ""mostly"" dry. I remain impressed with this tent. It was a good purchase.

Update #2 9/2016 - Still going...
This tent served my son well throughout his Boy Scouting tenure. The tent is still usable, though one of the poles has a weak spot on it. My original review was 5 years ago and the tent has seen a lot of use. I'm impressed that it is still going. I bought a second one for his younger brother 3 years ago. He is still active in scouting and the tent is going strong. It really has been a good purchase.",Survived a Storm,True,106

I'm 5'6 and most comfortable fit for me and my gear is on the diagonal as to not worry about touching the sides when it rains. Love the design, large screen vents on top, opposite the window & door screens for great cross ventilation on a clear dry night. Door is a good size for entry/exit. Rain fly easy to set up and longer than others at this price. Also an attached small mesh storage bag attached to the back wall to the right of the window as well as an extra loft storage net you can attach or not. Tent went up quickly and came down just as fast. This is a very light weight designed tent, would recommend tent & pole repair kits. Mine arrived with some minor screen damage no big deal. It's kinda a pain in the butt to re pack, but with practice/use it gets easier. Tent stakes are small aluminum pin type, standard. would buy a stronger set for the weekend camper will last longer. The tub floor is a great feature, a small tarp under it and a heavy blanket inside on floor works great to reduce moist/damp feel adds a little comfort as well. Tent is awkward as a backpacking tent at 23""L x 6"" H x 6""W, you can repack to a smaller width and put into a compression sack, if you remove & combine poles & stakes in pole bag and keep separate. This tent is perfect for kids, 3 adverage size at max. Would have like to see zipper pulls on inside of tent but at this price you can afford 1 pack at local store. Also a key finder works great to find your tent in the woods after a hike or in the dark. Overall a smart purchase!

update: was able to accommodate the twin size Coleman 4 in 1 air mattress under the rear window. Stretched out, toes touch the sides, but comfortable. There was plenty of gear storage room on door side of tent. actually a lot of room for 1 person. This is actually a quality tent, just need to figure out how to make it work for yourself. compared to other backpack tents this is a little heavier, but much stronger for the price.

B00AFDEJZY,4.0,"Edit April 2014:  LED lighting technology is progressing rapidly. For my purposes, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Diamond-Sprinter-Headlamp/dp/B0075W8UZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Diamond Sprinter Headlamp</a>&nbsp;, which is rechargeable-only (will not use disposable batteries) is my new strong favorite for its weight balance and its bright-but-diffuse beam.  Lowering ReVolt to four stars to recognize that progress.  Only if I were undertaking some days-long adventure that kept me away from recharge power would I consider using the ReVolt, for its ability to use disposable batteries.

Original review of ReVolt (before testing Sprinter):

To clear up a couple of points that the product description did not make clear:  This LED lamp ships with both NiMH rechargeable batteries, and a set of alkaline batteries.  Recharging is done with a micro-USB port on the side of the lamp, using a standard USB-to-micro-USB cable (included), plugged into your pre-existing USB power source (not included).

After living with this lamp for a week or two, I see it as a very well designed object, something I am glad to use.  Creative people worked effectively to make this happen.  For example, the controls via a single button require learning just a few simple rules of thumb and then become highly intuitive (after reading the little manual, and studying the pictograms).  The continuously variable brightness control (hold down the button until you get the light level you want) is ingenious.  Control can be ope rated with neoprene gloves on.

Nice touches of the design: The control button operates without clicking, so you can operate this without waking people up.  Red Mode (dim, for preserving night vision) is entered without cycling through the bright modes.  The charging process gives feedback about when the batteries are charged, and when they are fully conditioned.  The charger drops back to occasional trickle charge once fully charged, so you won't damage your batteries by leaving the lamp plugged in at all times even if you go months without using it.",Nicely designed rechargeable (disposable batteries supported too),True,64

B00AFDEJZY,4.0,"Buy yourself a Bushnell Pro High performance rechargeable headlamp 300 lumens , usb rechargeable. I bought this from Mercado Japan a seller on amazon. The headlamp arrived yesterday and I opened the package Last night , only to be disappointed after inserting the rechargeable batteries and reading the instruction booklet.
The headlamp would not turn on. I removed the rechargeable batteries and installed the alkaline batteries that came with it, and the light worked. So I tried the rechargeable batteries again thinking I might have installed them wrong. Well the light still wouldn't turn on , no matter how much I tried. So I figured that I would let it charge over night and try it out in the morning. The red light on the headlamp blinked all night, and come morning I tried to turn the headlamp on and nothing. I don't know if the unit or batteries are defective, but extremely disappointed to say the least. I had to call customer service and ask for a  refund.  I regret spending nearly 80.00 dollars for something that doesn't work. I'll update this within the next couple of days, to tell you how the refund went. Well here is my update...
And I have to apologize to Mercado Japan from what I've been reading on various sites , black diamond has a few issues with their rechargeable batteries. So I contacted black diamond's customer service and was asked to file a claim on their website and I would receive new batteries at no additional cost. I was told regardless of who the vendor is , black diamond guarantees their products. I received a email notification that my batteries were being shipped out within the next couple of days.

B00AFDEJZY,4.0,"I have had many LED lamps over the years. The first generation ones were superior to the old bulb types as far as battery life but that was about it. You were lucky to see 10 feet.
The last one I had was made by Coast and it had a powerful beam that spotted out a good 75 yards of more. The drawback was it was a massive battery hog, even when dimmed down.
I spend on average 3-5 nights out on the trail 2-3 times a month 6 months a year. I would usually need to replace batteries after every trip and sometimes during a trip if I used it more than an hour a night. I figured a rechargeable led was the way to go since I carry a solar recharger and rechargeable battery pack anyway.
The Revolt is a nice design and has some decent features. I like the lock button especially. Nothing worse than discovering your led headlap got switched on in your pack when you pull it out. It has a red led so your night vision isn't ruined if you need to look at a map while still hiking at night.
The reason I give it 4 stars is the spotlight is not a very good spot. It will light the  trail and is adequate but distance wise its only lights about 50-60 feet out. Its a wide spotlight but I wish it projected out better. I haven't used it with nonrechagable batteries so maybe it's a bit better with their higher voltage.
However as far as battery life goes on rechargeable batteries I'm impressed! I figured the batteries would last longer if I charged it fully and ran them down till they died, and recharged before a trip. So the week before I left I fully charged it and turned it on full brightness before I went to bed. I figured it would be almost dead by the next morning. Boy was I wrong! 12 hours later it was still plenty bright and the battery charge indicator was still green meaning it was more than 50%. So I left it on. I knew it would be dead that night and was wrong again. Still showing 50%+ on the charge indicator. 24/hours and its still good, plenty bright to use. I leave it running. 48 hours later its starting to dim, slightly. The charge indicator is still green though. So I figured that was enough! My previous Coast LED was good for about 8 hours. Then it needed nre batteries and that was with the expensive lithium batteries. It would eat a set of alkaline batteries like a snack, 3 hours tops.
I'm sold on the Revolt now that it's been out on the trail twice. Both trips were for 4 nights. I didn't use it heavily but in total probably 2 hours a night. I didn't notice any dimming at all. Both these trips were cold for central Florida weather. Lows in the mid 20's. Below freezing usually kills batteries pretty quick but not the Revolt.
The included recharable batteries are 1000ma. I have some 1250ma capacity batteries I modified to work in the Revolt that should give it an even longer runtime between charges.",Excellent Backpacker Lamp,False,9

B00AFDEJZY,4.0,"Everyone I know uses Black Diamond headlamps, but I've always owned Petzl. I've always wondered if I'd like BD better. When I had a bag stolen that had my newest Petzl headlamp in it I thought I'd try out the Black Diamond Revolt. For a headlamp that can recharge batteries with a USB cable it was a really good price, so I pulled the trigger on it. It has adequate lumens for my purposes (backpacking, evening hiking, and use around the house), although it isn't quite as bright as my similarly priced Petzl models. It has an awesome, fully adjustable dimmer setting that is the one thing that stands out as better than any other headlamp I've used. It also has a red LED setting, which is important to me - I actually find that I use the red LED way more than the white for late night use. As far as features go, I'm happy with everything you get with the Revolt.

The more I've used this headlamp though, I have a few minor complaints compared to similar offerings from Petzl. As mentioned above, I use the red LED setting often. It's great when you want to maintain night vision. I also like that if I wake up in the middle of the night and quickly use my lamp, the red LED wakes me up less than a bright white light. The problem for me is that the red setting on the Revolt is way too dim. It's hard to see anything that's more than just a few feet away. This makes it so that I can't use it in as many situations as I could with my old Petzl. I definitely wish it were brighter in the red mode.

Another feature on most headlamps is an adjustable angle setting where you can click it up and down to choose how high the lamp points. The Revolt has solid detents that seem like they will hold up well over time. This is kind of splitting hairs, but I don't like how widely spaced the detents are. It always seems to be too high or too low. YMMV, but I liked Petzl again here for the finer adjustments. I have to fiddle with the Revolt more often.

On the other hand, I'm not gentle with my headlamps. I use them constantly at home and work and any time I backpack or travel. I cram them into bags, toss them around a bit, bump them on things and occasionally drop them. It's hard to say, but friends that I work with and backpack with seem to have better luck with their Black Diamond lamps' durability. The Revolt is solidly built and seems to use batteries very efficiently. It seems like it might be a little sturdier and maybe last longer than my previous Petzl lamps, but that's purely a guess at this point. We'll see, but so far so good. I'm basing that more on friends' experiences with BD lamps. Either way, it's certainly no worse.

Overall, I think this is a pretty good headlamp. It's a solid value for the price and does everything I want it to. I'll continue to use it pretty happily, but when it comes time to replace it, I'll go back to Petzl. Even if the Revolt is a little sturdier, I like the way Petzl lamps work and feel. They're less clunky and they just seems to have their headlamps really dialed across the board. They're comfortable, intuitive and very well designed.

B00AFDEJZY,5.0,"I use headlamps a lot, primarily for night fishing, but also for night summer hiking in the AZ desert.  But for backpacking, I wanted something either long-lasting or that I could recharge with my solar panel setup.  This Revolt headlamp fit the bill.

Slightly heavier than my Princeton Remix (I'm assuming from the added recharge circuitry), this headlamp is still plenty comfortable to wear for hours.  When I night hike, I forget I'm wearing it.

I like that when I turn it on, it's already in the lower light mode (2 outer smaller LEDs), but with 2 presses of the only button it has, I'm now using the spotlight larger cree LED in the center.  Another couple button presses and I turn over to the red LED mode (really helps preserve your night vision while still giving enough light to read by or to do close tasks within a couple feet).  There's a flashing mode as well.  Best yet, if you hold down the button for about 4 seconds when it's powered off, it ""locks"" and you have to hold it down for 4 seconds again in order to turn it back on.  This helps prevent accidental turn-ons when it's stored in your pack.

I've used it a few times now, and the rechargeable battery life is ""ok"".  Alkalines run for days, but the rechargeables discarge a bit faster than I expected.  I do a night hike in my neighborhood that takes me about 1:20 to complete, and I can get 3 nights of almost full brightness on one charge.  After that, I can tell that the light is dimmer but I've never fully run it out completely to see how much usable light it puts out in case of emergency.

Rechargeables (included) are only a little less bright when full, but they dim faster. Great for urban use when you will be returning home to recharge them. Some mistaken complaints in these ratings about the included custom NMH batteries. They are customized so that the charging circuitry can distinguish them from other batteries and switch to internal charging through the USB port. The distinction prevents the circuitry from trying to recharge alkaline batteries. Other NMH battery manufacurers understandably don't provide this customization, but you can still use other brands of NMH batteries, you will just have to swap them out for recharging in their cradle instead of in the headlamp.

B00AFDEJZY,5.0,"I'm a longtime fan of Black Diamond's other headlamps, the waterproof 'Storm' and the water-resistant (but not fully waterproof) 'Spot'. So when this model came out, with the ability to USB-charge any rechargeable AAA batteries, I had to try it.
I waited until it went on sale, bought one, loved it, and I just bought my second. Here's why:

1. Black Diamond makes quality headlamps. Some other companies do too, but I have found BD to be just consistently better. Good workmanship, good build quality (remember we're talking about plastic here) and very good performance specs on brightness, length of beam and battery life.

2. The ability to recharge your AAA batteries in a remote situation is great. So you can plug this BD ReVolt via USB cable into any portable USB battery, or a solar charger's USB port, or both, and not only recharge your ReVolt headlamp, but recharge additional AAA batteries that can then be used in other devices, or stored. Nice.

3. This ReVolt unit ships with both a set of alkaline batteries AND an included set of rechargeable batteries. Plus a charging USB cable. You can use that included USB cable with any wall charger or car 12V DC charger that you own(the charger itself is not included, just the USB cable).

4. There's a green LED light that comes on for 2 seconds when you first activate the headlamp to inform you that the batteries are sufficiently charged. When green changes to yellow or red, it's time to recharge.

5. Like the Storm and the Spot models, the ReVolt has a full dimmer range for both its spotlight and its area-flood settings. Hold the button down and the light will recycle from dimmest to brightest; just release when it hits the light level you want.

6. The stated spec's on this headlamp are reasonably accurate. All headlamp makers seem to exaggerate their claims to battery life, but BD does this much less than most, and BD headlamps come closer to actually delivering their promised performance spec's than most.
With any headlamp, you'll always get MUCH better performance (brightness, range and battery life) from an alkaline battery than from ANY rechargeable--that's just the tradeoff in being able to reuse a rechargeable. The difference can vary from 20% to 40%, in my experience. By the same token, you'll get much better performance with an expensive Lithium battery than either an alkaline or a rechargeable.

There's a little rubbery flap cover over the recharging port ( that hockey-stick-shaped grey piece to the left side in the Amazon photo). That prevents the ReVolt from being certified truly 'waterproof' like the Storm. I haven't had my ReVolt out in the rain yet.
If I knew I had a good chance of getting really wet, I would reach for the Storm first, and then the 'water-resistant' Spot, and I would try not to bring the ReVolt out in the rain, or out into water sports.
Thought: I would put some Scotch tape (or duct tape?) over that charging port flap to help secure it from both water and possible dust.

SUMMARY: Another great BD headlamp, with a recharge-your-AAA's option. When on sale for a few extra dollars more than a Spot, I think this is a solid buy. The ability to charge your AAA's in the ReVolt, then remove them for use in a different device, is really handy--much more versatile than only being able to recharge a built-in nonremovable battery that only powers a headlamp.
So if you are expecting to go off-grid for awhile, or want a prepping option for an extended power outage, the ReVolt has a lot to offer.
And now that the USB battery recharging option is available at this pricepoint, I expect to see it start appearing with other battery powered outdoors devices...weather radios and GPS, for instance. Should be interesting.

I hope this review is helpful. I like my first ReVolt so much I bought a second (on sale). Money well spent. I'm satisfied, and no complaints. Happy trails, everybody.",Black Diamond ReVolt Headlamp 2014 --Recharges any AAA's by USB cable,False,

Oh, I guess I should say something about the light. Well, it has spot, flood and red. I really wanted the red to save our night vision, but this red mode isn't very good. The flood mode is pretty good and the spot mode is good.

I typically lead the hike at night with flood on and also use a Maglite XL100 to see far ahead. The combo works great.

B00AFDEJZY,4.0,"Admittedly, I don't have a lot of headlamp experience. However, this light does everything I want in a general purpose headlamp. The spot is bright and reaches out well, the dual flood beams illuminate an entire room, and the rechargeable function is so much more convenient than messing with disposable batteries. I use this for running, camping, emergencies, and I have one in each of my med kits, one of which stays in the truck. The beginning of each month I take all my various lights and plug them in to make sure they're always charged up and working properly. There are brighter headlamps, with longer throws and more battery life. That's not the role this light fills. This is supposed to be a sturdy, reliable, convenient light that does numerous common tasks well, and it accomplishes that. I almost went with a Fenix lamp but their max output lasts 5 minutes then steps down to medium. This light does what it says it will with no marketing tricks or gotchas, and that makes me trust Black Diamond with future outdoor gear purchases.

I did, however, knock off a star for charging time. It seems to take longer than it should, taking sometimes hours to go back to completely full after using it for only a minute or less. Once charged, battery life is as advertised as far as I can tell, but waiting half a day to recharge it to max capacity after a 3-4 mile jog seems strange. Luckily the direct access charging port makes up for some of that, since that is still worlds better than having to pull the batteries out to stick them on a charger, and you can charge it in the vehicle to, from, and between activities.","Great all around, general purpose headlamp",True,6

3) red light also...

All in all I liked it",Good headlamp......,True,
B00AFDEJZY,5.0,"Now Granted, if someone received a defective device out of the box, in which I only see a couple reviews for - that would obviously be a concern.  That said,  The other complaints in the Amazon reviews for the Black Diamond Revolt are simply unfounded.  One person complains it took 20 minutes to open the box.  It only took me one minute to open the box.  One person says there is a more efficient way to recharge batteries.  I am not an electrician and the batteries included recharge just fine via included USB cable.  Some people just cant be appreciative regardless.
NOW FOR THE REVIEW:

INCLUDED IN THE BOX:  (3) Black Diamond rechargeable AAA batteries.  (3) Energizer Lithium (regular) AAA batteries.  (1) USB to micro USB charge cable for the headlamp.  (1) ReVolt Headlamp.  (1) Set of detailed folded instructions

FEATURES YOU MAY NOT BE AWARE OF:  Out of the 4 light settings,  2 of these light settings are adjustable to any brightness level.  The spot light (One large center white LED) goes from dim to very bright simply by holding the top button down and it will cycle from dim to bright back to dim and keep cycling brightness until you let go.  Same goes for the Fill light (2 small white LED's).  While on the fill light option just hold down the top button and let it cycle through dim to bright until you get the brightness you desire then let go.  The only two lights that do not cycle are the strobe and red fill lights.  The strobe is standard speed for bike riding at night.  The Red fill light is for minimum light at camp without the brightness to disturb neighboring camp sites.

ANOTHER FEATURE I WAS UNAWARE OF:  The light itself has 3 tilt down settings.  When you are wearing the head lamp you have 3 tilt down settings in which the entire front head lamp clicks down and remains sturdy in position.  (The lamp will not tilt by itself without you clicking it into place).  The 3 tilt down positions seem to be perfectly aligned when you wear the headlamp as you would a bandana or other head wrap.  When worn in this fashion (towards the middle of your forehead) the standard no tilt setting shines higher than line of sight.  1st setting down is straight forward at line of sight.  2nd setting down is just below line of sight, and 3rd setting down is more for walking around camp, cooking, and other activities where you need light to work in.

WHY I PURCHASED THE BLACK DIAMOND REVOLT HEADLAMP:  As always I did extensive research by looking at all descriptions and about 1/4 of all the reviews at Amazon as well as my favorite backpacking review site outdoorgearlab.com.  Outdoorgearlab had the most extensive reviews as well as brightness charts and batt usage times / weight comparisons etc with all the other top lights available.  I immediately noticed the Black Diamond Revolt was one of the top 3 lights out there.  Although this lamp had a medium spot light max distance of 60 yards (compared to the brightest black diamond at 120 yards),  The Revolt headlamp retained the most sustained distance for the longest period of battery life.  The brighter headlamps all fell short of the Revolt after just 2-3 hours of battery life (both rechargeable and alkaline battery tests).  That said,  The Revolt is a superior headlamp if you want max distance for max hours of use.  Now having purchased this headlamp,  I am more pleased seeing it in action.  The variable dimming on the spot light and fill light was a huge added plus for me.  Great headlamp.  Love the light weight.  Love the tilt down features.  Love the rechargeable USB cable feature.  This truly is one of the best headlamps out there.

B00AFDEJZY,5.0,Great and rugged light very versital with the USB charger. The ability to cycle thru the brightness as well as change to red light for night is great,Rugged versatile light,True,
B00AFDEJZY,5.0,"I have owned a ton of headlamps and none have come close to the functionality of this one.

First, being able to charge it right before a trip is awesome, because you don't have to make the decision whether or not to switch out the half-used batteries.  Charging can take a few hours up to about 1 day, but I have never worn it all the way down.

The diffuse LED setting really has no area of focused light and evenly lights the area around you.  It is perfect for reading or doing tasks that don't require bright light.  The wide angle allows you to keep your peripheral vision as well.  The red light is almost as well distributed and much dimmer.  I use this for reading in bed or in the car to keep from distracting the driver.

The focused beam of light is really bright and wide enough to work really well for hiking or running at night on trails.  This setting and the diffuse LEDs are both highly adjustable.

I've only had this for a few months, but so far I have not found a single complaint.",Best headlamp I've ever owned,True,2
B00AFDEJZY,5.0,"I've been a very early morning runner lately, precaution is a must in visibility and reflective wear. The light beam is very ideal in distance, more than needed. Unless you're going 55mph? In other words, plenty for decision making before arriving the visual illuminated area ahead of you and I it remains strongly lit in either of the two settings for at least 2 hours. I would not know after 2 hours, cause I have only used it for that extent and I end up recharging once used. It stays put too on my head and sometimes I can adjust to the outdoor lighting and have my headlamp on backwards as a beam reflector, angled slightly down to my right backside. If it makes any difference to know my average speed run using this headlamp, to know at what speed it remains in place, it is between 6.40 to 7.50 pace.",Nice piece for running or other outdoor activities,True,
B00AFDEJZY,5.0,Best headlamp I have ever used. The focused beam it's bright and perfect for looking at things further away and the surround lights a great for working around camp in this dark. The reachable batteries hold their charge well.,Best headlamp.,True,2
B00AFDEJZY,4.0,"I would start buy saying I found this headlamp to be comfortable, which is an important consideration for anyone that uses a headlamp for any long period of time.  It sits comfortably even without a top strap.  I've used it for hiking, working in tight spaces around the house, and late night yard work (don't ask); it stays stable and doesn't fall out of position.  It is not waterproof, but it handles rain just fine.

The light is clean and crisp, and works as advertised.  The spot has a good throw and a tight beam, and will give you good distance vision.  The floods are dispersed, are not glaringly bright (and therefore are great for walking around a camp with other people around, since you won't blind them when you look at them), and give good peripheral vision.  The lights can be dimmed down or up depending on your need with the single multi-function button.  The red LEDs provide good working light for working night vision if you have need for it.  And the strobe strobes, as strobes are supposed to.

Having used different headlamps before, I found the single-button control a little confusing at first, but nothing complex.  Once you think about it for a second, the control pattern is logical and easy to remember.  After using the lamp a few times, the control pattern gets engrained quickly.  It is essentially a formula based on single presses, double presses, and long holds.  So, in my many ways, it mimics concepts that most of us are already familiar with (mice and touchscreens use similar time/tap based control patterns).  The button is also easy to operate with gloves on, which is a problem I've found in other headlamps that have tiny or more complex controls.

I got the headlamp in Citron because I like my camp gear to be pretty vibrantly colored to make it easier to find in the dark or stuffed down in my bag.  The Citron does not disappoint.

My knocks on the headlamp are that, as noted in other reviews, you have to use Black Diamond AAA rechargeables if you want to recharge the batteries while they're in the headlamp.  This isn't a huge problem for me because this is the only item in my backpack that uses AAA, so I can just plug my headlamp into my solar charger during the day when I'm out.  However, if you had multiple items that used AAA, you'd either have to buy multiple BD AAA or carry mixed brands and multiple chargers.  It's a minor nuisance.

Also, the headband slips easily when not under compression.  That is: when you are wearing the headband it hold fine.  But when you take it off, you have to be a little careful because it can easily slip through the retainer and change size slightly.  This is a very minor problem.

Finally, my biggest concern with this lamp, compared to many competitors, is the flimsy feel of the hinge of the battery compartment.  The entire front of the lamp swivels away to accept the batteries, and the hinge joint seems rather cheap.  You have to be careful when closing it because there is a rubber flap that will tend to catch.

Overall, I think this offering competes well with other similar headlamps in the same weight/price range.  It is, in my opinion, a significantly better light than my Surefire Saint (running on 123s).  The light is not as good as my Petzl Myo (which is my favorite headlamp as far as illumination), but it is also running 3 AAAs instead of 3 AAs in a separate battery back.  It is a excellent medium-weight lamp at a fair price.  Plus, it looks like a Transformer eyeball, and you can't beat that.",Overall good headlamp with just a few minor drawbacks,True,6
B00AFDEJZY,5.0,"Let me say first that I love the lamp and the various modes and intensities you have to choose from.  I don't agree with the other complaints saying you need 12 buttons on the lamp for each separate illumination mode.  The single button work fine for me, but to each his own.  I purposely got this lamp to use rechargeable batteries as I do a not of night activities and I get tired of wasting AAAs.  Also I have a solar charger so I like the idea of being able to top off my batteries on my backpack during the day and burn them up at night.

But regarding the batteries, I'm losing my faith in humanity that plenty of grown supposedly educated people can't figure out that you can use any other rechargeable AAA battery in this headlamp!

There is nothing unique or special about the Black Diamond batteries other than the fact that they had to trim back a bit of the shrink wrap covering the outside of the battery exposing the metal sides to work as a safety feature.
They do this a safety feature so some twit doesn't put regular non rechargeable batteries in his lamp and walk away with it on the charger which will of course subsequently burst and potentially burn up his car or house.  The fact that so many people can't figure this out is evidence enough justifying Black Diamonds concerns.

If you want to use any non BD batteries all you have to do is trim off a little bit of the shrink wrap on your batteries exposing the metal (use your included battery as an example of how much to trim) so it will complete the charging circuit in the headlamp.  You will notice that inside the battery compartment there is little metal contact that engages the side of each batter near the negative end (see photos I uploaded).  This is the safety feature to prevent the charger from trying to charge a regular battery because it cannot make an electrical circuit as long as it is fully shrink wrapped.

The only difference between BD's batteries and other rechargeable is the fact that they are 1,000mah where most others are around 750-850mah.  So that only means if your existing stockpile is 750mah that your lamp will not run as long before needing recharging.  I had some old Energizers that have been sitting around for 7 years that I just put in there and they charged up and worked fine.
So please ignore all the same people who would give a 1 star rating to a book of matches because they still couldn't figure out how to start a fire with them!

Keep in mind that eventually every battery will fail!  NiMH batteries can fail after sitting around for prolong periods of being totally discharged.  And if you go out and buy the cheapest dollar store rechargeable batteries you can find, well you get what you pay for.  So if the lamp rejects your batteries its not a problem with the lamp, its just saying it believes the battery is toast.

This lamp has a built in circuit to prevent over discharging of your batteries.  IE it will shut down the lamp before totally discharging the battery.  Many other devices will just run until the batteries are exhausted, then if you leave the batteries in that device it just sucks any remaining life out of the battery totally killing it.
However you may be able to ""rehabilitate"" your battery with an external charger first.  If a battery is over-discharged the lamp may initially reject it, but if you have an external charger you can give it an initial charge then put it in your lamp where it will recognize it.  READ the manual that came with your headlamp and understand the blinking lights and the color codes during charging.

Also the lamp will not ""over"" charge your battery.  Once full it shuts down and will only give it a brief periodic trickle charge to maintain peak charge.  Most standalone chargers will just keep trying to charge a fully charge battery and that is just as bad as over discharging.  If you batteries are hot in the charger, they are full and being over charged.  Older outlet style chargers were notorious for this and many still are.

So if you batteries are already old and crappy you may have to pick up a few new ones to start out with.  But rest assured that you can use others instead of relying on the Black Diamonds.  But for the price and the fact that the Black Diamond batt's are 1,000mah they are still a very good value!

There are a ton of rechargeables on Amazon, but many are advertised at a higher capacity than they really are.  So you order what is marketed as a 1,000mah batter but in reality it may only be 850mah.
I have R/C hobby chargers that can measure how many amp hours I put back in a cell and the BD's are legitimate 1,000mah's.

Hope this helps all those who don't yet have the lamp and needed this info, and to those who already have it, but need others to do the heavy ""mental"" lifting, LOL.","Yes, ""YOU CAN"" use other rechargables that are not Black Diamonds",True,206

This light allowed us to see in our tent as we packed to bail out.  The light was on for more than 5 hours on the included batteries.  The on/off  button is kind of clunky, but not a deal-breaker.
Highly recommended.",Swoon...,True,
B00AFDEJZY,4.0,"I bought this headlamp as a result of it receiving a Best of 2013 award from Backpacker magazine.

Pros:
*  The single LED spotlight mode is the best I've used in any small flashlight for reaching down the trail.  You could hike a well groomed trail at night with this headlamp.
*  The red LED feature is very helpful in preserving night vision when getting up at night.
*  The two flood LEDs do a better than average job of lighting up close work in camp, but I have other headlamps that are marginally better in this area. (My criteria for this feature is a soft, general area illumination without a center ""hotspot"".)
*  The dimmer feature is very good with the flood LED's, such as reading in bed, in order to reduce glare and conserve battery power.  I do not see a purpose for this feature in the other two modes (spot and red LED).
*  It's great to be able to charge the rechargable batteries from a laptop USB port.
*  The ability to use either rechargable or single use batteries is a significant plus, allowing the light to be used in both overnight and expedition treks.

Cons:
*  The one-button-for-all-functions design is poor.  The button has to be poked, mashed, and held down in a specific order to access the various modes and functions.  Since it's not obvious what type of poking initiates which mode, there's an unnecessary amount of trial and error involved each time in just getting the right light to turn on.  Better is single function buttons for each feature.  Subtract one star.
*  The elastic head strap lacks an over-the-top strap.  The weight of the light tends to make it slide down during periods of high activity.  Make the strap removable for those that choose not to use it.

Overall, it's a great light and I recommend it as a great all purpose light to take, if you're only taking one on the trail.  It would be perfect if the button issue was corrected.","Great Light, but Fussy Power Button",True,13
B00AFDEJZY,5.0,The ability to dim the intensity and recharge the rechargeable batteries with a USB jack is genius. I highly recommend this product!,awesome headlight,True,
B00AFDEJZY,4.0,"The button can be a little hard to find especially with gloves on but I use it that way every day. The spot light surprised me when it lit reflectors up more than a quarter mile away. The proximity setting makes working in the dark like day time, it lights the area all around. The head band will shut off the circulation if you're not careful and time will tell but I don't think it will loose elasticity like the grocery store models do, it's much better quality. I like the dimming feature but don't use it much. I don't know why anyone would pay this much for a headlamp but I'm glad I did and I hope it lasts a lifetime, but if it doesn't I'll probably stay with the ""Storm"" I model. You might question your judgment on spending so much money on a headlamp but if you're like me you'll be glad you did.

I like this light but the third time I attempted to charge, it would never fully charge. The light soon failed completely. I found a couple batteries dislodged and not making contact. Reseated the batteries and it seems okay. There is a design problem that allows this to happen.",Expensive but good quality. See Update!,True,
B00AFDEJZY,5.0,I've been using this headlight for a few weeks now and I'm really loving it. Walking around on a summer evening is just a part of it. I am a veterinarian and do a lot of surgery.

B00AFDEJZY,5.0,"This is a really good backpacking headlight. I had an old Ion headlamp strap lying around. I took off the big strap that this Revolt comes with (IMO useless & too big), & used the Ion stretchy headstrap.

The Revolts strap weighs 0.8 oz, too much, & adds an ounce.

The Revolt with the smaller elastic strap now weighs 2.8 oz, only 11 grams (0.4 oz), more than the Petzl Zipka Plus 2 headlight.

But, the Revolt's lumens are Sooo much more, I can finally hike in the dark.

The Revolt has all this rechargeable battery options, I suppose are good, but that was not why I bought this. Where I need a lot of light is, rocky hilly areas at night, & 70 lumens won't cut it. But I tried the Revolt on my usual night hike in the mountain foothills. The Revolt's 110 lumens in tight technical night places will do it for me.",I can see now in the dark!,False,4
B00AFDEJZY,5.0,I purchased this headlamp because my older one had recently shorted out. My roommates had Black Diamond headlamps and they seemed so much brighter than mine when we were on the trails at night time. I loved the fact that the ReVolt had a charger plug-in (so you can plug it into any electrical outlet to charge it). It came with a re-chargeable set of batteries as well as a Lithium set. You have the ability to dim the different lighting styles (should you not need 100% light and also a good way to conserve battery life).,Great Headlamp!,True,2
B00BC3R4SK,5.0,"This item is a great addition to my Glock 19. The bottom of the laser is flush with the bottom of my trigger guard and the front is flush with my slide. It is actually a bit larger than it appears. However I noticed it added just enough weight to the firearm with a full magazine to add a great balance when aiming. I installed this laser in about 10 minutes. No windage adjustment was needed. Just a minor elevation adjustment was made. The laser itself is very bright and easily accessible from either side. I especially like the pulse mode feature. It also came with a pressure switch for AR platforms. All in all it seems to be a great laser. Of course with a laser on your weapon, finding a CCW holster to fit is nearly impossible so, I cured that with a Glock Grip Clip which allows cocealed carry even with any laser. It can be worn with light clothing without ""printing"". Thus far I am very pleased with this purchase.",Great Laser Without Breaking The Bank,False,7.0

I will get the ball within the correct distance of the whole, but end up 30-40 yds left or right of the green - often times in the fairway of the adjacent hole.

B00C2Q3I72,5.0,"I'm so pleased with this simple, not so expensive, solution to car topping my kayak. I got a Perception Conduit 13 and it weighs about 51 pounds. So heavy and a bit unwieldy for one person. This side loader is wonderful and works as advertised. The cross bar that extends outward hooked onto my 2006 Subaru Outback factory rails crossbar is the primary item that holds the weight of the kayak. Nevertheless, it's really good to have the vertical pole as a secondary support. I have had it happen that I was a bit careless about placing and tightening the pole as well as I could have and it fell while I was loading the kayak. Turned out OK as the extension of the crossbar was able to hold the weight. Word of caution: my kayak is very narrow at the ends, the bottom is not flat at those spots so when loading on to the extended crossbar, it rocks and has to be held steady to get it on there and loaded. I have had it happen that it rubs against the side of the car when loading or unloading and I scratched the finish. This is easily solved by just placing a towel on the side of the car, towards the rear  when loading and unloading. Lastly, I appreciate some of the quality extras. the bag is handy to have as it keeps the various parts safely tucked away to prevent damage to the inside of the car. The crossbar is padded with a sleeve of some kind of woven nylon do when the kayak rests on it, it has something to grab onto it a bit and prevents needlessly scratching it. The hooks that grab onto the crossbar fit reasonably well given that mine are factory rails and the hooks were not designed specifically to fit those. And, if you didn't catch the detail, the kayak is 13 feet long. Very pleased. So happy I have it worked out that I can load and unload my kayak on my own without help.",Love The Simple Functionality.

He got some pretty cool gifts for Christmas but he said this was by far his favorite.,Huge hit!,True,
B00C9KRYY4,5.0,"This game is a hit with our ten year old son who consecutively beat his dad and grandpa.  This is a traditional board game in the sense that there is no electronic technology or batteries required.  The board is a true board with magnetic strips at each end where you place the team banners during the game.  The game uses a few sets of cards for offense, defense and special teams plays.  The offense and defense cards are drawn by the players and the combination indicates how the ball moves forward, backward, scores or turns over.  There is a dice for field goals and PAT's.  The process is really quite simple.

Players can choose their teams each game. Every team is represented by a banner.

We enjoyed the games.  This can be played by kids or adults.  We have enjoyed playing it and I can see my son playing it with his friends.  It only takes a few minutes to get up to speed for the first time. It is a game that is determined mostly by the draw of the cards.  The one element the instructions were not clear about for me were the time out cards, so we haven't used them.  I don't think they are necessary.",This is a Fun Game for the Family,False,

B00C9KRYY4,4.0,"My son and boyfriend (football fanatics) really like this game, (and talk the requisite trash to one another while playing, which means they're having a blast). And it's taught me a little more about football.

(""Hey, why are you moving that little man each time?""
""*chortles* Mom, it's not a little man; it's the first down marker!""
""Oh! Well what's a first down and how many do you get?""
*son slaps head in amused exasperation*
*loving boyfriend explains, patiently*).

Like other reviews have stated, both my big and little football fans said the game would be vastly more fun if each team actually had the strengths and weaknesses of the real-world teams. As it is  now, winning this board game is NOT based on forming the best strategy against the opposing team, but on knowing what types of ""play"" cards that person will most likely choose next, especially taking into account what they last chose. This made me almost beat my son because I know him so well, not because I'm a great football strategist. (I say ""almost beat"" because we stopped early due to bedtime.) This can be a pro or con, depending on football knowledge of your players and what you want out of the game. No advantage at all to having more knowledge of football.

Rather pricey for what you get, but it's NFL branded, so it's to be expected. We do love that the pieces are magnetized to the board. Nice touch!",Nice for football fanatics plus football novices... and both can play together fairly,True,

B00C9KRYY4,5.0,"My 8-year old son really loves this game. We played it twice on Christmas Day. When you pick your five cards on offense and defense, there is definitely strategy involved, as there is in the real NFL. You have to guess what kind of play the offense/defense will run and you have to mix up your play calling for sure. For example, if you choose an Interception card on defense, and the offense picks a Run card, then you just wasted your Interception card. I also like the Play-Action cards on offense because even if the defense picks a Pass Defense card, you can still get some yards out of it. Oh, and the Timeout card is great because you get to trade in all your cards for new ones if you don't like them.

You then take turns on offense and defense trying to beat the other player.  It allows you to choose plays from cards that you are holding.  If you pick a play and the opposing player picks the wrong defense you gain yards.  If not they can stop you, force a fumble or intercept the ball.  It is a great way for both parent and child to learn more about football and strategy.  I don't see us ever getting bored.

B00CGOV340,5.0,"I have bit of a inexpensive knife obsession and have bought just about every ~$10 knife on amazon... Well not every one but quite a few of them. I can definitely say that this is one of the nicer ones. The assisted opening works well, the knife locks into place well and comes fairly sharp right out of the box. Here's a few features I really like about this knife.

- The ""Clasp"" - One feature as well that this knife has that many of the cheaper knives do not is that the pants clasp (don't know the technical name) is quite tight on it, where I have easily bent them on other knives, this one seems much more stout which I like.

- Seat belt or line cutter - Another feature I really like about this knife is that it has what's listed as a seat belt cutter, but this can also be used for cutting braided fishing line for fisherman. It's much safer to use this to cut fishing like than to use the full knife.

-Window breaker - Didn't actually test this as I don't have any extra windows to spare, but this feature could be very useful if ever in an accident.

- Sharp knife and partial serration - Some folks love serrated knives and some hate them, I like them in some respects and enjoy that part of this knife is serrated and the rest is straight blade.

Currently I am using this knife as a tackle box tool, I have used it to fillet fish as well as cut fishing line among other things. It works great in this capacity and would be a fantastic every day carry knife for anyone! I already own another rogue river knife that I carry every day as well.

He can verify where or how parts go together simply by checking the mat while he works.

He also uses it as a mouse pad for his desk.

B00DPKZ1WO,5.0,The AR15 Field Guide is a great addition to any range bag or gun bench. The chain makes it easy to hang on a zipper or a hook on the bench.

It is small enough in size and weight to make it perfect for range bags and  other on the go applications, but they have done an excellent job of keeping the pages clear and concise so that they are very easy to follow.  Another great feature is the coating on the pages, no worries of grimy fingers ruining the content just wipe them clean.  Color coding , arrows and lubricate amounts are just the icing on the cake.

I built my AR from scratch and wished I would have had this quick reference guide in the early days.  I can promise you the next time I hit the field you will find my Real Avid AR15 Field Guide in my pack.

#TheChaplain","Real Avid AR 15 - Small Package, Big Value",False,
B00DPKZ1WO,4.0,"The Real Avid AR15 Field Guide is a valuable tool for any shooter, but especially those new to AR platform rifles.  The guide is broken down into six parts, covering all aspects of proper cleaning and lubricating of your rifle.
However, I found a couple things that could be added:
(1) Sometimes when cleaning/scraping the bolt, it is necessary to remove the extractor to clean carbon build-up from beneath it, which can cause a failure to extract the spent casing (FTE).
(2) When installing the bolt into the carrier, it is imperative that the gaps in the gas rings are equally spaced around the bolt.  If they are lined up, the rifle will not function properly.
I know most know this, but people new to maintaining these rifles may not, so it would be a good addition.
Another nice feature of this guide is the coated pages.  Spill some cleaning solution or oil on it while cleaning your rifle?  No sweat, just wipe off the pages with a clean cloth and you are good to go!
I would recommend this product to any AR owner, especially a new owner.  It's compact size makes it easy to take along in your range bag for quick reference.
I gave it 4 stars, but I would gladly go 5 if the two omissions I noted were added.

The look resembles dog tags which is a plus, especial for all those ex military guys out there.

Each page is detailed with drawings, easy to follow directions with number to numbers matching picture to part. If you're uncomfortable with breaking down your firearm because youve messed up in the past DONT BE with this reference field guide it has easy break down and do steps backwards for easy re assembly. Just to see how easy it was I had my wife follow step by step, page by page directions and she broke down my AR and reassembled with out a hiccup.

B00DPKZ1WO,5.0,"Just got my 'pocket' guide. I guess I thought I was thinking I would be getting something that could fit on your keychain - LOL! This thing is BIG - about 3 x 5 inch (like recipe card size with rounded edges)

This is like a small kid's picture book - in a good way - GREAT schematic drawings of the components of the AR, with arrows showing rotation or movement/direction to clean, and how to use an AR scraping tool (theirs, of course. This book is also a small advertisement for Real Avid protects - kudos for a great marketing idea!!). It also shows cross-sections of the area you are cleaning so you can see the inner-workings of your task. When you get to lubricating, it has an easy to follow guide (yellow drop shapes) to show how much oil to use on the various parts (1 drop  - 'drop' oil; 2 drops - light oil; 3 - drops - heavy oil) and uses these indicators with the pictures of the areas requiring the lubrication

The outter 'covers' of the guide are very thick, protective, laminated cardboard-type material. (The laminate is said to be oil and solvent resistant). The AR you see on the front is actually a 'cut-out' showing the color of the first page in the 'book'. Inner pages are much thinner, but also laminated. Their are 22 pages, front and back.

The info is detailed, step-by-step, and color coded for the simple, routine cleaning procedures necessary to keep your AR functioning well.

Field Guide info it contains:

A 'tools required' page and picture of actual items used
Intro & safety page
Table of Contents
  Introduction. (page 1-10)
  Disassembly. (page 11-16)
  Scraping. (page 17-26)
  Cleaning. (page 27-33)
  Lubricating. (page 34-39)
  Reassembly checklist. (page 40)
There is also a few pages of Real Avid products advertisements for their AR gun kit, Scrapper Tool, and CLP

Pages are numbered, the color-coding is at the top of each page telling you which step you are on. (divided into a 4 section schematic/timeline of the 4 steps, so you can see where you are at in the process)

The only thing that could make this better is that the chain that holds the pages together make it a pain to turn and keep the pages folding onto one another. I might have to replace this with a keyring, or it will start to irritate me! But I'm not deducting any points since that is just a small thing.

THESE CARDS ARE GREAT! If you are a newbie, like a lot of folks, you won't find an easier-to-follow, easy range-bag sized booklet for care of your AR. This would also be a great gift idea for a friend who has an AR as well. Priced right at $9 - $11. Well worth the purchase!

B00DXG62SW,5.0,"Fast shipping. Great ar500 gong target. Chain kit is highly reccomended and is super easy to put together. I'll be back for a silhouette target soon.

B00DXG62SW,5.0,"I bought these to shoot in the back yard. I live in the sticks so its ok. Anyways, I was worried if the 3/8 would hold up ok, being that my larger calibers are .45 and 308 and mostly shoot at a max of 75 yards, but usually at around 50 and less for the .45. Well they held up just fine, not even a small dent. Just be sure to respray them again so that they don't corrode.",Took a hit from 308 and laughed.,True,
B00DXG62SW,5.0,"Between my friends and I we have put roughly 500 rounds of .223, .22 and 9mm down range at this thing and it is still in great shape. And who doesn't love the sound of your well placed shot hitting steel? TING! The construction of the steel is top notch and the price is reasonable. Make sure that you follow the safety guidelines on mounting this thing or buy their mounting kit.","Well Made, reasonable price, made in the USA.",True,
B00DXG62SW,5.0,Get it. You won't be let down.,Five Stars,True,
B00DXG62SW,5.0,"Shot this one with my 308 ballistic tips from 300 yds with a noticeable ding even with ear plugs on. Not even a dent or ding super surprised cause my last metal target had holes like you drilled it with a drill press!! Well worth the money and super happy with purchase... Oh my 308 with 150 grain heads chrono at 2,800 fps.",Very tough!!,True,
B00DXG62SW,5.0,I put about 100 rounds of .223 on it at 100 yards and all it did was knock the paint I put on it off and a couple of small dents on the edge. I put another coat of paint (for visibility) and it looks brand new. It is a hell of a lot of fun to shoot. The picture is the target with the mounting chains after 100 rounds. One even hit the chain and only left a small dent. This set up is super heavy duty.,Strong,True,3
B00DXG62SW,5.0,"Great steal.  Nice clean cuts. Completely dimple free after 1,000's of rounds of everything from .22LR to .30-06.  Great prices.",Great steal. Nice clean cuts,True,
B00DXG62SW,4.0,"The target is of good quality.  Holds up very well to 9mm.  Shipping is very poor.  Ordered it on the 14th, and it didn't show up until the 22nd.  Eight days later.",Well Made Target,True,
B00DXG62SW,4.0,"Holds up great at the range, no problems at all.",Nice target,True,
B00DXG62SW,5.0,Fantastic stuff. The product is well-cut and was shipped very quickly (even though the shipping was free!). The separate target mounting kit was high-quality and the instructions were perfect. No complaints whatsoever. The price is great for what you get (especially considering the free shipping). I absolutely will be buying many more. No more paper for me...,Fantastic steel targets!,True,
B00DXG62SW,5.0,Work well. Gong gives instant feedback when hit. At distance it would be hard to see hits but the sound lets you know right away. Amazons price was right too.,Makes for a fun trip to the range,False,
B00DXG62SW,5.0,"Great value. 556 at 100 yds barely make a mark or dent, if at all. 9mm at 15 yds same thing; virtually no marks. Should last a lifetime.","Pew, Pew, Pew. Great value here.",True,

B00DXG62SW,5.0,"Simple steel target. I have hit it from 50-250 yards with 6.8 SPC, 5.56, and 9mm with no visible damage. I suggest getting some white spray-paint in order to see your hits from a distance.",Simple steel target. I have hit it from 50-250 ...,True,
B00DXG62SW,4.0,"Nice target.  Use heavy chains & hardware.  Whatever mounts the target will fail long before the target.  3/8"" has been fine for .223 @ 300 yds.  a few hundred hits with 55 gr SP & FMJ & other than paint chips you can't tell it's ever been hit.  I didn't know if I needed 1/2"" or 3/8"" but the 3/8"" seems just fine.  300BLK FMJ hasn't hurt it either.",Nice target. Use heavy chains & hardware,False,
B00DXG62SW,5.0,"Ordered a 4"", 6"" & 8"" x 3/8"" target plates. shipping was prompt. They were cut cleanly, the edges were square and free of slag. Have been wanting to go with steel plinkers to reduce costs of paper splatters, also being to be able to hear the hit and not have to always walk down to my stand to review shots. The plates have exceeded my expectations and will additionally reduce shooting costs. Would definitely recommend to my friends. Don't plan on the need to order additional plates (unless I want different size/ shape)!.",Great value,False,
B00DXG62SW,4.0,This takes 5.56 like a champ at 100yards. I painted it fluorescent lime green with some spare paint to make the hits visible too.  It dances like crazy hanging on 10inches of chain; enough to knock the sawhorse stand over with a couple of consecutive hits.  Is loud on impact with 21drr protection on. Had some trouble finding hardware to fit the holes to hang it.  Bring it to the store with you to be sure!,Works great but get a sturdy stand.,True,
B00DXG62SW,5.0,"I bought three targets (4, 6, 8 inches).  Of all, I like this one the best.  This target will be used at distances out to 400 yards with 308.  The cuts and quality are there edge to edge.  I am satisfied and will be ordering more.",My favorite of the three I ordered!,True,
B00DXG62SW,5.0,These plates are perfect for plinking with my 5.56 AR. Easy to hang. The FMJ rounds do not damage plates. These should hold up great and they were an excellent value.,Excellent Plate,True,
B00DXG62SW,5.0,"Really excellent stuff here. After over 100 hits, this thing looks pristine even though it's dealt with .223, .308, and 7.62x54R. The ""dents"" are barely noticeable and are extremely shallow. Shooting FMJ's at 100yds saw almost no ill effects, with the exception of any shots that hit the very edge. I have a few spots where the larger calibers took bites out of the edge of the target, but by no means is the target unsafe or significantly damaged. I suspect soft points would be the remedy to that problem. I expect to be using this thing for a looooong time.",One tough mother!,True,
B00DXG62SW,5.0,I finally found the time to travel to my property in Virginia and set this target up. This target is solid (and heavy) and it sounds good when hit. It is just the right size for a challenging and distant pistol target. My Makarov rounds didn't make a dent (just a smear); I am looking forward to firing some 9mm and 32ACP at it!,Excellent Target!,True,
B00DXG62SW,5.0,"I got my target in on a Thursday and had it installed on a Saturday. It's perfect. I have another steel target next to it for my 9mm/357 and my little girls 10/22. The 3/4"" regular steel that target is made of will put a big divot into the steel, so I knew I needed the AR500 steel. This is a great price and I went out and added it to my stand. Works GREAT. Not one round put a divot into the plate and only the 62 grain rounds made any 'chips' on impact. Most just shattered the bullet. For this price? You can't go wrong. It's worth every penny.",WORKS PERCFECTLY,True,3
B00DXG62SW,5.0,"I sprayed these with primer to help protect from the elements.  They make a great addition to my backyard range.  I shoot  .17hmr, .22lr rifles and 9mm pistol.  I am sure they can withstand much greater punishment.  Soon, my son will be shooting 556 rounds at them and I have no doubts on whether these can withstand those hits. About once a month I will re-spray with primer or maybe either bright yellow or bright blue to increase visibility (Orange blends too will with the hill I use for a backstop).  That's a lot less maintenance than wood or paper targets.  The only problem I have is that these are shipped covered with a lot of carbon dust (from the shaping process??) and it messed up a white shirt I happened to be wearing when I opened the package.",Great Targets,True,3
B00DXG62SW,5.0,"Received my 8"" AR500 target today a few days early ,I might add via the post office.  Hooked it up to my hanging platform and blasted away.
 First up were my .40 S&W  Walther and Beretta pistols at 15 and then 30 yrds.  Next  was the .357 Marlin 1894 lever and Hi-point .40 carbine at 50 and  100 yrds.  Love the nice gong sound even at 100 yrds.  Just for fun then turned loose my .22lr semi auto carbines and Henry lever at the 100 yrds.  Even at 25 yrds my Colt 1911 ,Sig and Beretta .22lr were sounding good.
 Great target and plan on getting a few more for my shooting buddies.",the real gong show,True,
B00DXG62SW,5.0,There is no replacement for the positive feedback of shooting steel. If you are looking to sharpen skills on fast target acquisition and follow up shots; steel targets are a must. No more hanging paper and walking down range to see how you did. Each hit will ring out loud confirming that you are the badass you thought you were! Plus they last for thousands of rounds! Great investment.,A must for any shooter.,True,
B00DXG62SW,5.0,"ar500 8""x3/8""  great targets for me to practice my shooting at different distances. these targets are cut very nice, just hope the ears hold up with all the hits. going to try 44 mag later.",ar500 shooting targets7,True,
B00DXG62SW,5.0,we bought this 8' Ar500 shooting target to plink with. We shoot a .22 up to a .223 on this target and it's holding up like a champ! so glad we bought 2 so we can have one on down range. LOVE IT!,AR 500 target its WONRERFUL!!,True,
B00DXG62SW,5.0,"If you are an active shooter or a beginner and have never shot steel, you owe it to yourself to do so. It is so much fun for practicing or plinking! Fun for the whole family!! I've had these for only a couple weeks now and I've shot em about 15 times!! We have shot everything from .22LR to 44 Mag at these targets with no damage what-so-ever!!! I was amazed at how much we could shoot at this with zero damage. All that came off was the spray paint we put on! The whole family loves the ""PING"" that everyone can hear when a round hits. Buy some and spend some quality time with the people you love. These are high quality plates and are HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",FUN FUN FUN!!!,True,2

B00DXG62SW,5.0,Love these targets! just shot 150 rds of 9mm and 200 rds of .45 at it. not even the slightest ding. Excellent steel targets!,Gonna order more,True,
B00DXG62SW,4.0,"These are definitely AR 500.  I tested them with my M & P .223 at 50 yards, and barely a ding was made.  I bought 5 of these at a reasonable price to be used at my outdoor range, and got the chains also just to save me a trip to the store.

My only qualm with these was the way they were shipped.  Oh my, I was so sad for the mailman as the package had come apart and the pieces were everywhere.  Again, 5 gongs of various sizes and 5 sets of chains were ordered by me,  and they were crammed in one USPS box with a board in the bottom to supposedly secure them.  Of course, the box couldn't handle the weight.  It was in shambles.  My friendly postman, thank God, is a nice fellow who made sure I got all of my order.  Please guys, I will order from you again if you promise not to use a flimsy, tiny box to ship my stuff. Maybe you can use multiple boxes.

Otherwise, I'm happy.","Great gong, but...",True,
B00DXG62SW,5.0,"I'm very pleased with how this order was processed and how the gong looks. Living in Hawaii most companies will either not ship here or will ship it slow-boat...when I placed my order for the 8""x3/8"" AR500 gong the order was processed and shipped that day and the package showed up on my door step 4 days later (ordered day after christmas). For the mainland that may be slow but for Hawaii that is unbelievable! Gong came packaged nice, looks great and i will be painting it this weekend. I""ll be saving $$ on paper targets and would recomend this to anyone.
Thanks for a great product and customer service! Aloha:)",Great gong & good price:),True,
B00DZ3P91Y,4.0,"This is a great bench for people with limited space and don't want/need $5000 worth of equipment.  It arrived on time and was packaged well with no damage and no missing parts.  It is easy to assemble (took me about an hour and 45 minutes because I am somewhat obsessive/compulsive) but be sure you have a reversible ratchet wrench and a set of stationary ratchet wrenches to simplify assembly.

The bench is well constructed and the gauge of steel used is great.  The directions are pretty easy to understand and well labeled.  Once assembled, the bench is sturdy and does not wobble (just take your time putting it together).  The leg extension/curl mechanism is not as good as the machines at the gym but I expected that; its good enough for what I need.  The padding for the leg device is not perfect but I'm not using 100 lbs. for extensions so it seems comfortable to me.  You can adjust the height of the pads that go under your knees for extentions/curls by removing the bar and placing it through the lower/higher holes in the support beam.  The incline/decline system is smooth and will meet all your needs.  Would I go heavy and try to bench 300 lbs.?  Probably not but I'm not at that level and never will be so it's all good.  I use 70 lb. dumbells for bech pressing and the bench handles it perfectly.

The padding on the bench and seat is great and I feel no discomfort when lifting.

PROS:
- Well constructed with well made parts
- Directions are easy to read and labeled well
- Very study once assembled; no need to be frightened while lifting
- Light enough to move easily and a great space saver

CONS:
- Taller gents/ladies may have a problem with the leg extension/curl device.

Overall it is a great bench for the money and I would definately recommend this to anyone!  I didn't give it 5 stars because products that deserve this rating must be flawless...this bench is close but practically nothing is flawless.",GREAT BENCH FOR THE PRICE!,True,16
B00DZ3P91Y,4.0,the seating is poorly positioned but aside from that its so lightweight yet sturdy the only setback is the spacing of the seating area needed to be a few inches further from leg attachment or maybe 6ft tall is too tall I guess.,... positioned but aside from that its so lightweight yet sturdy the only setback is the spacing of the seating ...,True,

B00DZ3P91Y,5.0,"Just used the bench, it's perfect. I use dumbbell's who needs a barbell rack. Any type of incline or flat bench press plus the leg curls and lifts. Oh and curling station also. Well worth the money...",Glad I bought it!!!,True,
B00DZ3P91Y,4.0,"Overall, a good bench for my first home gym. The price was better than most adjustable benches with a 400 pound weight rating. I would recommend this bench to my friends.

PROS: The bench is very sturdy; sitting on the edge is safe, and I can do box jumps without feeling unstable. It's rated for 400-pound capacity, but I have had no issues with higher weights so far. The pad is comfortable, and the bench is light enough for my wife to lift and move.

CONS: The pads for the leg mechanism aren't bolted in place; they just slide on and use friction to stay in place, which may not last for very long. The seat does not adjust, which can be uncomfortable during incline/decline lifts; the back pad does adjust, but the pin can be difficult to pull. Also, I have to open my knees around the leg pads, which isn't a big deal for someone 6 feet tall, but shorter people may find this uncomfortable.",Great bench,True,2
B00E1Y6LBS,4.0,Case is good. Could have been a little bigger for ease of placing the flags. How do you keep the extra flags not on the stick. It's kind of hard to stuff them without crimping them and then they have creases on them.,Nice product,True,
B00E1Y6LBS,4.0,"Super light weight, nice handle.  Not sure what the other reviewer is so concerned about, the little C clamps.  The flags come with 4 extras.  You get two sets of flags and a total of 6 C clamps.

There is an issue with the tips of the rods.  There is a little plastic plug that goes in the top, but it's not made very well, nor fits well.  I discard them and sanded the tips of the rods, to remove the edge.  They are aluminum and didn't want it cutting into the fabric.  Just take a little sandpaper and smooth down the edge on the tip of the aluminum shaft.

The flange that goes against the deck or bulkhead is not absolutely, perfectly flat, and I wish it were. [Update: After installation, I realize that even though the face that fits against the deck or bulkhead isn't flat, it's OK because it does tighten down flush. And a little dab of sealant/adhesive goes a long way to ensure a more solid install.

B00FGPUYD2,5.0,Kids love it,Great for kid,True,
B00FGPUYD2,5.0,"We bought these a couple years ago to use for a couple of kids for camping (because the toy store sleeping bags just don't offer enough warmth or ruggedness for the ""real thing"" in terms of use). But there have been some problems.

First, the good:

- Very, very warm, absolutely up to the assigned temperature rating
- Quite roomy for the price
- Materials are nice and feel good against the skin while being tough enough for outdoor use
- Pockets are a nice touch
- Zippers are easy to operate at first

Now, the bad:

- Zippers broke within the first year
- Strings to tie them also tore right off of the bottoms of the bag within the first year (not well attached)
- As a result, we're now trying to decide whether to replace with same or to look elsewhere

We really do like the basic bags and features. While they were in one piece, they worked very well and the kids liked them a lot.

And while it's fair to point out that they were used under very different conditions, it's also fair to point out that the toy store sleeping bags that aren't warm enough for camping are still in one piece several years later, while these basically lasted one season and several camping trips.

I don't expect miracles for this price, hence four stars, but a little more durability and care in assembly and materials selection would have taken us to five stars. We'll probably replace with same, as I'm not sure there's anything better, on balance, in this price range. But I admit that I will secretly grumble just a bit at having to buy the same bags again so soon.",Very nice bags in terms of usability and warmth; a bit lacking in durability.,True,14

2. The bag is a great size. I'm not good at rolling things up to fit back into the carry bag, but I was able to easily do it with this sleeping bag.

3. The filling seems very comfy to me. The girls thought so too. It should keep them warm on cooler evenings and be okay to use on warmer nights.

4. The zipper seems to be a good quality and easily manipulated by kids.

5. The width and length is perect for the age range of our girls. Our 5 year old is small for her age and our 7 year old is bigger for her age..  so maybe 3-8 is a good range for other kids. Im really glad I didn't buy this one for our 10 and 12 year olds, as they would definitely be too long.

Cons:

1. Im not a big fan of the strings that tie the sleeping bag closed. I wish they were velcro straps... but since the sleeping bag easily fits back in its carry bag, it's not that big of a deal.

2. Both the inside and outside are the slippery matrial. The girls were sliding around quite a bit while getting in and out of it. Thankfully, the sides of their cot go up a bit so they shouldn't slide off their cot at night.

Overall, I am super happy with this purchase. We went ahead and bought another design in this same sleeping bag for our 5 year old son.",Great for kids,True,7

My son is seven and a little past the cutesty character age so I searched Coleman for a youth sleeping bag and found this adorable option. I love the blue color and the camo print on the inside.

I've had my Coleman for 20 something years so it's a name I trust. These sleeping bags are great quality and have a lot more features than mine does. It has an inner pocket for things like cell phones which my kids loved.

I like that the material extends out on the backside where the head goes for a little extra comfort. I always shoved my pillow inside my sleeping bag for this reason so it's nice they now have this.

The sleeping bag can be zipped to another and I got my daughter the same one in the pink color so they thought that was a fun option.

It does not scratch the flashlight putting on or off, which I have had happen with tight fitting filters on other flashlights. Apart from the fit, the lens works the way it is supposed to work, and quite frankly, I was surprised at how well it worked, it is not a flimsy little piece of red plastic, but a robust little filter.

Although it is good quality, it seems like an afterthought that conflicts with the PD35's sleek design (makes the flashlight wider at the tip, is shiny plastic as opposed to the PD35s almost matte finish.

Some pedals on some of my bikes have long and aggressive pins that actually lock your foot in place with the amount of grip they provide. These aren't THAT crazy, and for the bike they're going on (a full suspension dirt jump bike) that should be great.

B00INQVYZ8,4.0,"I had a rare device that was made by a now defunct company called Heartbeat.  They made the Heartbeat Trainer a device that integrated video game playing with a Sega Genesis based system into a workout device.  I adapted an exercise bike to have the controls and the motion sensor. It was fun to play the game and work out at the same time as the device tracked my effort and my pulse.  One of the issues was the pulse clip kept coming loose or just getting intermittent signal from the ear clip.  I asked the people that sold me the system and they sold me a dongle and a Polar sensor very similar to this one. The exception was  that it transmitted to their device which displayed data on my TV, rather than the cell phone.  I had to use my friends new Android phone, mine was just too old for this.  They should probably post compatible information online.

The software was nice and this is very responsive.  Polar still sells similar stuff but now they use Bluetooth as well and they have their own watch like receiver, but I don't know if they have a cell phone interface, but I'd guess they probably do.  The cost factor on this seems pretty inexpensive for what it is.  I paid more for what I got way back in 1994, and The value of money was somewhat more at that time.  If your a big guy like me, you may have to attach some extra spandex on this as they never make the belt big enough.  I guess I assume they don't think people my size exercise, they should make an extender.  I probably won't be able to do a follow up unless I get a new fancy phone, but in limited testing, the software seemed decent.  Recommended, but their are other options so look around for one that fits you best.","Pretty cool device, Bluetooth replaces the old dongle method.",False,
B00INQVYZ8,4.0,"The app that comes with this heart rate monitor is the true winner in this product. The heart rate monitor itself is effective and comfortable (at least as comfortable as a heart rate monitor strapped around your chest can be.)
The Wahoo Fitness app is a great workout tool. It allows you to pick your goal, and offers different fitness routines to achieve that goal. It uses your heart rate from the monitor to keep you within different heart rate ranges while you workout. It really helps break up the monotony of a workout.
I do have to warn future users that the app isn't available for any devices that have an older operating system. The only device in our 'smart device' filled household that was compatible with the app was the Samsung Galaxy S3 (android 4.3+). It would not work on our iPad, Motorola Droid Razr HD, our Chrome book, or our MacBook. These devices couldn't pick up the signal from the heart rate monitor even when uses apps that were compatible with the device.
You can use the heart rate monitor with other workout apps if you like (Endomondo, Runkeeper, etc.) However, these apps simply allow you to see your heart rate, which is somewhat limiting the potential of this device because of the awesome features of the app.

Overall, I would highly recommend this product with the app to anyone that has a device/operating system new enough to run it, and wants to take his/her workout routine to the next level.

I received this from the manufacturer for testing and review and have shared my honest experience in this review.",Great tool to fine-tune your workout,False,7
B00INQVYZ8,4.0,"I wouldn't consider myself a hardcore athlete, but I've been running for about a year and using my Garmin Forerunner 410 GPS watch to push myself and learn how to run better.  I've been able to do 15k at a pace under 8 minutes/mile, and I'm currently training for a marathon.  I have been training with a Garmin Watch paired with the new Garmin HRM3 heart rate strap (which you can tell by the gray woven fabric on the strap they've added since the HRM2).  I find it important to measure my heart rate during runs because it allows me to tell when I am exerting too hard and will run out of energy, and also allows me to know when I can push myself a bit harder.  The watch is easy to see on my wrist, but for many people who are running with their iPhones already, buying a running watch can seem a needless expense (latest models can cost $400).  I also find that when I travel, I always bring my phone but don't always want to pack my watch as well.

I bring all of this up to introduce the Wahoo Fitness heart rate monitor, an excellent alternative to the watch/HRM combo.  Most fitness devices such as Garmin watches use a low-power wireless protocol known as ANT+.  ANT+ is designed for low-data throughput applications to preserve battery power.  Using ANT+ with a smart phone like an iPhone requires a special external adapter.  However, Bluetooth Smart or Bluetooth low energy has been included in iPhones since the 4S (but not the 4 or earlier), and works similar to ANT+.  This Wahoo heart rate monitor will pair with either ANT+ or Bluetooth Smart, meaning it will work with most modern phones with no additional hardware required.

Compared to the Garmin HRM, the Wahoo is a bit larger, but hardly noticeable once it is on.  The Garmin HRM attaches to the strap, and the strap hooks with a bra-like hook closure.  The Wahoo strap uses the white-plastic monitor itself as a keystone.  The strap is 1 solid strap, and each free end snaps onto the HRM itself.  This is a nice design that reduces clasps which could possibly irritate.  The electrodes themselves seem to hold moisture a bit better than the Garmin HRM, but honestly, both seem to work quite well.  Both HRM's tend to give erroneous values during the first mile of my runs until I start to sweat, no matter how much I wet them.  Much of this is due to me wearing a technical fabric shirt which builds up ESD.  Running in cotton or shirtless, it works immediately.

A great feature Wahoo includes in the HRM is that it lights up with alternative red and blue LED's while connecting.  I love this visual feedback. Since all HRM's go to sleep and must wake by sensing they are on your body, it can be frustrating if they aren't detected immediately.  My Garmin gives me no indication it is on.  I need to rescan and reposition it, not knowing if the problem lies in my watch or the HRM.  The Wahoo lights up immediately so I know it is powered.  My phone found it almost instantly.

I decided to test the Wahoo TICKR HRM with the Wahoo fitness app, but bear in mind it works with Strava or any other app that can recognize Bluetooth Smart sensors.  The app has a bunch of really nice features that alleviate the need for visual feedback on your wrist.  For instance, it gives audible feedback that is fully programmable.  I set it to auto-lap every 1 mile and tell me my pace.  However, you can set alerts for just about anything from pace to distance to heart rate.  So if your heart rates goes too high, it can tell you audibly so you know to back off.  I really enjoyed the mapping features in the Wahoo app and found them quite useful.

The Wahoo app has some more complex features for heart rate training, but I did not see a way to setup a more complex run such as intervals, threshold runs, etc.  However, if you have another app with those features, I suppose you could use those as well.

Looking at Wahoo's plans for this new line of HRM's, I see plans for ones with accelerometers like the new Garmin HRM-Run.  This does not have those features, but I am excited to see what those are like when they are introduced.

My conclusion?  Overall, it's a solid 4 stars.  The strap is comfortable, accurate once you begin to sweat (like all HRM's), reliable, and I like the app.  If you don't already own a running watch, this is a great low-cost start with heart rate training.","Pair it with an iPhone and your running watch may be obsolete, but not quite yet",False,

B00INQVYZ8,5.0,"I bought this heart rate monitor when I decided to start cycling regularly. I have used it for two full seasons and have yet to change the battery. It continues to provide an accurate heart rate to my Strava app when I'm on my rides.

I like that the heart rate monitor turns on automatically when the two halves are connected. The lights turn on and let you know that it's working, and it just simply works with no fuss. The strap is well-made and easy to adjust, and the snaps work easily.

It appears to be pretty accurate and I have not experienced any dropouts like some have. I was rotating this between a couple of Garmin hrm's and Polar but I've been using it exclusively for at the last 6 months. I don't like the strap as I've had it come loose on a number of occasions so I started using the TICKR with a Garmin soft strap but the Garmin soft strap broke on my the other day at the gym and I had the snap together in the middle Wahoo hrm strap and so far I haven't had it come loose. Also the device itself seems kind of cheesy, not the quality feel you get with the Polar H7 of Garmin hrm run2.

B00INQVYZ8,5.0,"So far, this heart rate monitor has been amazing. The strap has a wide range of adjustments, and I find that making it just a tad bit tighter than you'd think you'd need it makes it stay in place perfectly during long rides while cycling. I cannot speak to the sticking capabilities while running. The heart rate monitor connected to my phone once I plugged the strap into both nodes, and I already had the Wahoo app downloaded on my phone. You don't have to futz around with Bluetooth settings or anything like that, and my connection was almost instant. I simply went into the ""Sensors"" menu on the Wahoo app and it showed up after hitting ""add new sensor"".

Once you have the device saved in the Wahoo app, the pairing will remain seamless each time you want to use it. It was just as easy to connect it to my app of choice, Strava. I just make sure that when I'm not using it I leave at least one of the strap nodes disconnected, as I believe this prompts the device to go into sleep-mode quicker, in order to conserve battery.

I've tested the devices reading against a couple of other devices and all of the readings are similar, so I believe that this provides enough proof of accuracy.

Overall, with the device being so sleek, thin, and light, and with the ability to connect it to my phone for readings in almost any HR-enabled app, it's the best one I've used.",Simple and Easy to Use HR Monitor,True,

B00INQVYZ8,5.0,"It's easy to use, not very large, has good range (about 15 feet for me), and works very well.

I found that this one didn't initially function at all. No lights, no detection. After a little online digging, I found that sometimes these get confused before the initial use and won't start up the first time. The solution is to put the battery in backwards for a good ten-count and then put it back in correctly. The reason this works is that electrically, it shorts out the battery contacts without shorting out the battery (it's perfectly safe). Or, in effect, it ""cold boots"" the device. While I was initially frustrated and angry that it didn't work out of the package, knowing that it can be reset if there is an error increases my confidence in the product.

This is actually my second unit. The first one got lost and never failed or required a battery change in the couple of years that I had been using it.

When you activate the monitor, it starts to flash, so you know it is working.  The strap is comfortable.  I like how it comes apart for washing, but one tip is to be careful when you snap both sides.  If you pull it too tight, the snaps will pop off and something will go flying.

B00INQVYZ8,5.0,"If it's good enough for Team Sky, it's good enough for me. The best part about this HR monitor is the versatility since it uses both ANT+ and Bluetooth connectivity. It plays very nicely with my Garmin Edge while cycling and with my iPhone 6S for other physical activities. I usually prefer Garmin brands, but this HR monitor is the exception. I have not had issues with it unsnapping as of yet, as other reviewers have complained of. Make sure it's snug enough to prevent that. It's also recommended to get the Wahoo utility app on your phone to keep the device firmware up to date. Keeping your Garmin up to date on firmware too will also keep the two devices playing nice with each other.

UPDATE Jan 2017:
One thing that made reluctant to purchase this were complaints that it unsnaps while riding. I decided to test this during my ride this weekend and purposely tried to do things to unsnap the band. I slid the band around a bit under my jersey and even tugged on the sensor, more aggressively than I would need to if I genuinely needed to adjust it while on the bike. The strap stayed snapped under my jersey through all the tests. I would guess other reviewers did not have the band properly adjusted to fit their chest, which would result in unsnapping. Just to conclude, I tried to unsnap it in a test, and could not. Stays on just fine.","Good for Team Sky, good for me! Bluetooth is great too!",True,

The only issue I have is that the contacts need to be wet in order to get a reading so you either have to buy and apply some electrode gel or just wait until you start to sweat for accuracy. It works with the Wahoo app (free) as well as apps like Strava. Since it works with ANT+ it also connects easily to older Garmin watches. The brains of the monitor are enclosed in a VERY thin case that is barely noticeable under even a tight fitting shirt.

B00INQVYZ8,5.0,"I bought this little guy to replace my heart rate monitor that came with my Garmin 910XT watch.  I was never super impressed with the Garmin equipment and after several years the HRM finally died (most likely due to me washing it in the washer - water got inside the unit).

The TICKR is easy to setup and pretty much seamlessly synced with both my 910XT watch, and also my phone to use with apps such as Strava.  The HRM uses both bluetooth and ANT+ so I can use it with my phone and my watch at the same time.

I like that the TICKR lights up when it is connected unlike other HRM.  Even though I have not had any connectivity issues, that will surely help diagnosis it.

B00INQVYZ8,4.0,"Works fine, once you discover that the key item is adding some moisture.  I find that wiping my chest with a bit of water (or whatever) is very necessary to get the monitor to pick up my heart rate.  This is not highlighted in the instructions, and I had a VERY unreasonably hard time FINDING some instructions.  Obtuse, too many pictures and not enough words (in English!), in the modern style.  Searching their website for instructions is hopeless, useless, worse than nothing because it SHOULD work.  Hence the 4 stars.

Once you FIND some instructions and heed them, it *works* just fine with Strava on my LG G4 phone.

I checked blue-tooth, Ant+ and tried another app, to no avail.  Some apps would interpolate a number when there's a drop-out rather than displaying zero, making it hard to distinguish a drop-out to a slowed down heart rate.

Then a few rides later, I found a fix, which was simply to move the monitor from the center of the chest 1 inch to the left, right on top of the heart.  Now the connection was solid through out 20 mile rides.  See my second Strava screenshot.  My guess is that the there's a dip in the middle of my chest causing contact gaps when I pedaled.  I can't believe all the product photos show the TICKR right at the middle.  It could be because I'm too skinny or because my of my ripped 6-pack (wishful thinking).

I've used it about 6 or 7 times so far both running and cycling. I even mow the yard with it just to see how much those big hills are challenging me with a push mower.
PROS:
Seems accurate.
I have not had any comfort issues at all.
Seems to have good compatibility. I use a Nexus 6P phone and Runkeeper- can confirm it works well with those.
Not overly priced.
Adds another small layer of fitness motivation. Both in terms of health monitoring, and also having another ""toy"" adds a little fun, which helps break up the monotony of some workouts, and that's always good to help keep me interested.
Battery life seems good (so far)
I sweat a lot. The band soaks it up, but so far no smell issues, and have yet to wash it. I hang it over a chair or towel hook and let it air dry.

The TICKR connected flawlessly with my Iphone 6s, and with both apps I use, Digifit and MapMyRide.  Haven't tried strava yet. The lights are nice, and let you know if the monitor has a Bluetooth connection and  is measuring heart rate.  Don't know about battery life yet, but hopefully better than the Polar, which was not good.  One nice thing is that you have to unsnap one side of the monitor to get the chest strap off, thereby disconnecting the unit, which should help with battery life.  I didn't read the quick start manual when I first got the unit, just hooked it up and went to the gym. I was disappointed when I got home and found that the lights on the TICKR  weren't flashing, I thought at first that it had quit working. Found out the LED's only flash for 30 seconds to conserve power :)  all good.

It was fine I suppose, but it seemed like every other run I was stopping and starting at the beginning because it was obviously not reading my HR correctly (bouncing up and down in crazy increments).

B00INQVYZ8,5.0,"I first got a Polar H7 to help me maintain my heart rate zones while cycling and get somewhat more accurate calorie counts. It was a headache nearly the entire time I owned it. While I believe owning a heart rate monitor is one of the best things you can buy to help with your fitness, I wouldn't recommend the H7.

The TICKR is everything the H7 isn't. It is reliable, connects fast, lets you know it's working (via the lights) and supports both ANT+ and bluetooth, so it's like 2 products in one. Also, the way it connects makes it slightly easier to put on, in my opinion.

The H7 would work fine for weeks, then have problems connecting for a few weeks, then be fine again. To get it to connect I'd have to unpair and repair, sometimes repeatedly. It had trouble with my iPhone 5 and iPhone 6, and with multiple apps (polar app, cyclemeter, wahoo app, others). The TICKR connects every time, instantly. I never have to wait for it. In case I'm worried that it isn't connected, the lights let me know it's working. But, I never worry that it isn't connected, because it ALWAYS WORKS.

Unlike the H7.

My experience with Wahoo support with other products leaves me confident that if I do have issues, they'll help me out quickly and with little fuss.

My only gripe is that the strap is a bit less comfortable than the Polar strap. The plastic bit in the back can press directly into your skin, and the HRM itself comes into contact with your skin. It would be nice if the only thing that touched your skin was the soft strap. Oh well, it's still the best HRM you can buy.-",The only bluetooth HRM you need,True,9

B00INQVYZ8,5.0,"I really like using the TICKR. I also own a Polar Wearlink+ BT (classic) sensor, and this one is not only much lighter than the Polar (I never thought to even check that before ordering mine, but as soon as I put it on it was remarkable who much of a difference that makes, in comfort if not utility), but it much more easily connects to my Galaxy S4. Readings are frequently updated, with no noticeable lag and no disconnections (I'm using ANT+ to sync the two; BTLE is nice, but ANT is more comfortable, requiring no switches to turn off and on).

Wahoo's Fitness app is also quite nice, allowing me to connect multiple sensors and get all of the stats I want during workout. (I used to follow my workouts with Endomondo, and this quite nicely replaced everything I could do and more, allowing me to use bike speed sensor to determine distance instead of GPS.)

The only caveat I'd add is that I like the Polar strap design better, with the clasp at the side and the sensor connected to the strap either before or after putting it on (you could also comfortably remove it mid-session, that way).","Great product, even without the bells and whistles of the 'Run' or 'X'",True,5

B00INQVYZ8,5.0,"My wife wanted a chest strap heart rate monitor and after much research I got her this one for Christmas. She liked it so much that I decided to get myself one as well. Both of us have been trying to get more effective workouts by monitoring our heart rate zones and the Tickr fits the bill. We opted for the regular Tickr as we're not runners and don't need the memory features of the Tickr X. We're using them on our Galaxy S3 and S4 Android phones and setup and connection was easy. The Wahoo app is actually pretty good but this monitor will work with other third party apps. As much as I like the Wahoo Fitness tracker app I'm also exploring other apps that will be able to sync to Google Fit and work with Android Wear. If the Wahoo app integrated these features it would be awesome!

I will say the only problem I have had is sometimes the unit didn't detect my heartbeat when I first put it on. What I've found is that the sensors on the strap need heat and a bit of moisture when it's making contact with your skin in order to work. Being that I have dry skin, especially in the winter time, the connection doesn't work many times for me. To easily fix this all you have to do is wet your finger tips a little bit and on the chest strap run them along the sensor strips near the snaps that go into the main unit. This will 1) help the unit get the heat and moisture it needs to make a good connections and 2) help it stick in place so it doesn't slide around!

Overall I'm very satisfied with this unit and can only highly recommend it for those wanting to track their workouts for the most effective results!",Great workout tracking on Android,True,10

B00INQVYZ8,4.0,"After some initial hiccups, this has brought a new level to my exercising. I have worn this while in yoga class, running, mountain biking, and on my indoor spin bike.

This review is being written relative to a Motorola X, 2013 model, currently running Android 4.4.2. The device requires a Wahoo Utility to update the firmware on the sensor. The chest monitor had some connectivity issues during pairing and subsequent firmware updates for the monitor. There were numerous drops and re-pairings required. Once the firmware was finally upgraded on the sensor, it has been rock solid with no dropouts whatsoever.

There is also a Wahoo Fitness app which I use when riding the indoor spin bike. It has several options for different exercise routines. The app forces the screen to stay on, which is very nice (you can of course turn it off if desired). The app has all the basic functionality, speed, cadence, heart rate, and time. Of course being inside, I'm not getting speed from the gps. Right now, I'm only using time and heart rate, but have the Wahoo RPM on my wish list for cadence. I can watch the screen during my workout and time my warm-up to my heart rate. I then usually ""sit"" in a target heart rate range in the 160-170bpm. I will occasionally peak train in the 180's, and back off to the target range. With the heart rate monitoring, I no longer just go spin on the bike and guess or ride endlessly for a period of time. The Wahoo Fitness app can be linked to Strava, once your workout is complete, you can share it right to Strava and see your heart rate:time almost instantly.

I also use the Wahoo Fitness app with the sensor in yoga class. Of course I'm not going to vary my workout here as it's lead by the instructor, but being a data junkie, I find it interesting to track all of my workouts and see how I'm performing.

For outdoor activities, the monitor integrates perfectly with the free version of Strava. Put the monitor on, launch Strava, and it automatically connects and you're ready to work out. No fiddling around with anything.

The strap itself is very comfortable, you get used to wearing it quickly. It does have a red and blue LED which is noticeable under lighter colored shirts.

I don't know that the battery will last a year as claimed, since a month in, my battery is already under 80%. There is no on/off switch for the device, I'm not sure if it wakes up from a bluetooth call or when it comes out of a rest state, from motion sensing?

It's fully waterproof, so I just rinse it off after use and hang to dry.

I specifically chose this device because it also features ANT+ connectivity. I was easily able to pair this with my Garmin Virb Elite action cam. The heart rate data is then captured by the Garmin, and can be overlayed onto the outputted video. Likewise, the Virb also features the ability to export GPS data and map to the heart rate, showing exertion levels per elevation climb, etc.

All in all, I'm very pleased with the device and would highly recommend it.","Some bumps in the road, but smooth sailing since then",True,3

B00INQVYZ8,4.0,"I just got an e-mail message saying my review ""helped"" someone so I figured I'd follow up and add some detail after two months:

The band is a non-issue - yeah it still kind of squishes together on my but that's because of my body and probably not really anything to do with the band.  It hasn't frayed or anything and the snaps are still very tight.  I wash it about once or twice a week on cold with the rest of my cycle gear and let it air dry.  This thing is comfortable to wear and it doesn't slip down on me or anything like that.  I personally never have to do anything with the contact points like wet them down; I just put the thing on and go.  Still no issues with staying connected with my 5S - I easily have 200 miles on it by now.

Never mentioned the app - the app is good.  I personally use Strava (which now integrates with the ""Health"" iOS app in iOS 8 which is cool.  I generally run the Wahoo app at the same time as Strava as I only use Strava for the core portion of my workout and not my cool-down ride afterwards.  I let the Wahoo app run from the very start of my workout (stretching) to the very end (taking off the strap and jumping in the shower) so that app is in charge of documenting everything.  I've had no issues whatsoever with two apps using the sensor at the same time.  I've compared one to the other as well to see if there was some variance to calories or heart-rate but seems identical whether one app or two apps are reading the data from the TIKR.  The interface is nice and clean, it shows your time at a ""burn"" heart rate as well as ""burst"" heart rate.  Some of the work out stuff seems a little gimmicky but I've never used it for that.  I simply let it track everything from the very start to the very finish.

Again, the TIKR is my first HRM so nothing to compare it too.  I looked really hard at the Polar H7 (I think that's the comparable one) and went with the TIKR because... well... I think the marketing got to me - just seemed newer and cooler?  It was geared towards iPhone/iOS?  I dunno - just went with it but the choice was really hard - the LED's are nice for knowing when the thing is ready to go but I guess at this point, I just throw the thing on as I've never had a problem with connectivity.  I'd like to try the H7 or whatever their next version is but frankly, I'd prefer to have the entire Wahoo line work for me.  I plan to get their cadence sensor and would like to try the RFLKT bike computer (once the reviews get better - sounds like it's still kind of buggy and I don't think it has a backlight?).

Original Review

I love this thing.  Works well with 5S - I've never had it stop transmitting during a workout ever.  I ride about 10 miles a day, 6 days a week - hasn't had a single issue.

I think the band is rather cheap.  If you have some rolls, it will fold over on itself.  I'm not a big guy but when hunched over on my bike, I still have a few rolls :) Usually running it through the wash will straighten things out.  Was annoyed at how much a new band is.  After a month of daily use, it's been fine.

Over all the device is awesome - I just put it on - no dampening the contact points or anything.  I love it.

I should state this is my first HRM so this is my baseline.  Seems well made and LEDs indicating ""on"" and ""heart beat"" are handy.",I love this thing,True,31

B00INQVYZ8,5.0,"I purchased the Wahoo RFLKT+, the Wahoo TICKR Heart rate monitor and the Wahoo blue sc speed cadence sensor. The installation was fairly straight forward once I figured oit that the speed sensor needed to be pointing up for my Specialized Roubaix SL2. The spokes hit the speed sensor when pointing down. Pairing/syncing the devices was easy after I put a new battery in the speed/cadence sensor.

I have gone on two rides so far and the system worked flawlessly. The RFLKT+screens are easy to customize or you can pick from some templates. The heart rate monitor is very comfortable. Past experiences with other HR monitors was that they had to be uncomfortably snug in order to pick up the signal. Not the case with this HR monitor. The speed cadence sensor worked as expected. My rides were for 1:30 and 1:45 so far and the battery life of my Iphone 5S was at 90% and 92%, respectively. I think the battery life will be fine but I have ordered a small external battery for long rides for peace of mind. For each ride I starrted Wahoo Fitness, turned off my iphone sreen and placed it in my under seat small saddlebag. I had no issues with the blue tooth communications.

B00INQVYZ8,5.0,"Update 10/15/14 The Wahoo tracker has been replaced and the new one works great. Hopefully it can hold up this time. Wahoo technical support has been great and has replaced the defective units with a new one each time. Hopefully this one keeps working.

This is an update:

The Wahoo Ticker has been replaced 2x by Wahoo and the 3rd one is dead. Replaced batteries with new ones, won't give any indication of lights, won't connect to Wahoo Utility, Strava or even the GPS. I don't know what is going on with these units but 3 since July. I only run and bike with the HRM and can't figure out why multiple units would go dead like that. I do not swim or get it near water so that should not be an issue. The units have all died the same way no notice just decided to stop working, you try and change battery but no luck. Customer service it good and they get a replacement unit out right away but it is an annoyance to keep replacing it.

Contacting support again for a replacement, all I want is a unit that will stay working. When it does work I have no issues with a Timex Ironman watch and my Galaxy S4 phone. I always have to carry a back up HRM with me that is not bluetooth so I only get data to the watch and not the ap.

I really want to give the unit a ""5"" star rating but since it goes down so much I have to lower rating to a 2

A normal run for me is anywhere from one to two hours, listening to Spotify, and with 2 Bluetooth devices and music streaming over the LTE network for 2 hours, the most my battery has drained has been about 1/4 on a full charge.  I track all my runs with Runkeeper, which recognized the monitor without any effort on my part beyond turning on Bluetooth.  It's accurate, light, keeps track of great info, and has a great price point.  What's not to like?",and I'm happy as can be with it,True,2
B00INQVYZ8,4.0,"It works, but....First, my phone: Android, Samsung Note II with Sprint using Strava. It does work, and it does work well. I matched my exertion against my heart rate today and was able to keep it fairly constant. Total success would give it 5 stars.

Why 4? Packaging is one reason: it says Apple all over it and does not say a thing about Android. Their website does, but when the package arrived, I thought it was a mistake, that I had received an older model.

Instructions. There is no button or slide switch to turn it on. It does so when you connect the strap and put it on. In addition, the website has a video, but some of us like to read. Something simple like: ""Simply put it on and it will start up."" would have been nice.

Back to the things I like:
*I thought the strap would be inferior quality, but it isn't. It should last a long time.
*Comfort: my legs demand my attention and the strap doesn't. It is comfortable and doesn't slip.
*It says to use saliva or gel to establish contact with the skin, but the saliva works fine.
*I don't have to use another app, nor a watch, nor do I need to transfer data. Easy.
* The reason I bought it: to monitor my heart rate. It works just like it says and my health is improving because of it.

I can see more of these coming into my home.","Very happy, except...",True,8

B00INQVYZ8,4.0,"I have been using the TICKR for a couple of months with my Moto G Android phone and I am very pleased with it. At first there were a couple of issues with spikes, but they were rapidly taken care of with a following version of their Wahoo Fitness App. Only thing missing was for the HR monitor to work with Runkeeper, and today I paired them successfully.

Follow the instructions in the link, they are extremely easy to follow, just press on the Heart icon on the main start screen choose ""TICKR"" and that's it.

B00INQVYZ8,5.0,"Initial impression: very handy, accurate, unobtrusive, easy to use

Pros: easy to set-up (both monitor and iPhone app) and pair; elastic band is plenty big for my over-sized ribcage; band doesnt slip even during intense and long running sessions; small chest monitor doesnt impede movement or natural stride in any way or feel uncomfortable

Cons: none so far, although Id recommend that Wahoo improve the directions for use as I only knew what to do after opening the box as Id researched the product extensively  may be confusing for first time or non-techie users

Im a semi-new runner that runs 4-6 miles per day, 6 or 7 days a week, on a treadmill  Im no gym bunny but I wanted to constantly monitor my heart rate during a running session to see how changes in incline and speed affected my pulse. Since using the monitor on a treadmill wasn't accurate (need to bend over and grab some handles which slows my pace and heart rate), Wahoos monitor seemed like a great option. I was really impressed when I opened the box as it was easy to put the monitor together and align it on my chest, and pairing with my iPhone was an absolute breeze. Once I snapped the connectors on the band to the monitor, the monitor blinked blue (Bluetooth) and orange lights, letting me know it was connected and ready to go. Wow! I instantly got on the treadmill and tried a whole bunch of incline/speed combos and this monitor/app combo is FAST. Numbers are in big bright red font on the app, making it easy to read a few feet away, and are updated constantly to where I didn't see a delay. As I also have an active Bluetooth connection to my FitBit and running earbuds, it was nice to see that 3+ connections to my iPhone wasn't a problem for heart rate accuracy. My initial one hour run didn't pose a connection problem for the monitor and it was updating every second; I even tried opening a new app over Wahoos several times to see if it would drop the connection or lag (which it didnt!!). Very impressed so far.
Ive been researching different monitors to find the best one out there and was impressed by Wahoos customer feedback, and finally bought this device as a reward when I hit my latest running milestone. Ill follow up with more comments as I use it, as the only negative feedback that I heard was regarding intermittent connectivity issues and another person saying that it was a battery hog.",So far a *great* little device that pairs easily and just works,True,9
B00INQVYZ8,5.0,"Short of using a power meter, training by heart rate is the best indicator of effort. This heart rate monitor pairs perfectly with my iPhone and compliments the RFKLT cycling computer and BlueSC sensor. I'm very happy with this setup.",Works great. Helpful Data,True,

B00INQVYZ8,5.0,This thing is actually pretty darn awesome...instead of having an ANT+/Garmin heart rate strap and then getting an additional one if you sometimes use your smartphone to track your heart rate (BLE) you get it all in one!  It works pretty darn well and I've never had problems pairing to any of my Garmin devices or my iPhone 5.

It comes with all the same features as the TICKR, including dual band technology and Wahoo's Burn & Burst Training Plan(tm) however, it has added features just for runners.

I gave my second one a go last night.  I used it with iSmoothRun for a 45 minute run.  It paired quickly with the app and as far as I could tell it didn't lose connection during the run.  The app chimed in to let me know at regular intervals if I was ""in zone"" or out of it.  It worked out just like I'd hoped it would to keep me in my heart rate zone when training.

The contacts didn't have trouble working with my hairy chest (tmi? sorry).  The unit is lightweight and didn't bounce or move around during the run.","Works well, wonky firmware?",True,

B00JCZNB5A,4.0,"I got this off EBay for my Kimber Ultra CDP II .45.  After having the person in the store show me how to do a take down of this gun and see him scruff the black coated metal with the take down tool that comes with the gun I was determined to find a better solution.  THIS IS IT.  You will struggle with field stripping the gun with the stock metal take down tool.  It scratched the black finish as well as the front of the gun just below the barrel opening.  Even with the stock take down tool inserted I struggled to get the slide lock pin out and when I did I dropped it and it too scuffed the black metal.

So, I sold the gun on Gunbroker for a FEW hundred dollars less than what I paid for it.  I then purchased another NEW non-scuffed Kimber as well as this plastic tool.  It seriously is the best purchase I have made for this gun.  With the slide locked just snap this plastic tool on then release the slide.  The slide lock will align perfectly to be removed - no fuss - no slide adjusting - no hassle!  Re-insert the slide lock pin, remove the plastic take down tool and then rack it - it is that easy.

Kimber - why do you not have such a tool that comes with this $1300 gun???

The only issue I have with the take down tool is the price - $20 for a small piece of plastic?  Really?  Well, if it protects my Kimber and makes it easy to take down I am sold.",Take down is now SIMPLE with this tool - Kimber Ultra CDP II .45,False,2

B00LDYLJDE,5.0,"This is a great little kit:  great performance, light weight, acceptably priced, well made.

The bellows is very well made, sturdy, and works extremely well.  (Works well for fires in fireplaces too, but a little short for that use.)  Buy it, carry it, use it!

The ""Baddest Bees"" tinder fuses work extremely well.  Compact, waterproof, fast-starting, hot burning.  But be sure to tease them apart into little fluffballs before trying to light them.  In contrast, cotton balls impregnated with petroleum jelly (e.g. Vaseline) are also compact, waterproof, fast-starting , hot burning, and they last longer (all once you tease them apart into fluffballs), and can be made cheaply at home, but your hands get greasy when handling them.  The Baddest Bees seem to be wax-impregnated, so there's no greasiness, and they're more compact than cotton balls (but don't burn as long).  You choose.

The fire steel is a pretty standard product.  This one has a nice, ergonomic plastic handle.  It's a little short, but then this is a compact kit.  You can easily get longer ones if desired.

The fire steel striker has serrations on the short end.  I found it awkward to use the end, but it strikes easily along the long edge.",A great innovation!  You need this if you make fires outdoors.,True,17

I tried this in the backyard during a moderate rain storm to see if it would allow me to get a fire burning.  It worked as advertised and with a little wind and rain blocking with my body I was able to start a fire with dry paper and then moved onto the damp paper in the burn barrel.

I gave 4 stars because I think it could be a bit less expensive but ultimately recommend this especially if you are the type (like me) that will tend to toss things in your backpack.  This is kind of set up to make you keep it in the container so you don't have to search for the individual pieces.

Pulled apart the tinder, hit the striker and it fired right up.  Once there was a small fire I used the bellows and very quickly got a much bigger fire.  It's long length keeps your face out of the fire and the smoke out of your eyes.  If you bought this hit I think you'd be very happy with it.",Very Effective Little Kit,True,

The bees wax tinder comes in another small container within the larger container that's probably not necessary but I am a big fan of overkill. The striker for the fire steel is a little flimsy but works ok in practice. I added some drier lint for extra tinder as there is a little spare room for it (or a cotton ball).

They said, later on if I get really serious , I can upgrade ..Sturdy, couple of guys really gave it  a hard 1 hr work out and its tip didn't fall off or break. Though they had to re-tighten the tip, it later settled in good & tight. It's feels much better than the cues on the wall.
Update: the guys said all screw-on tips break easily if you don't re-tighten every now and then, especially when it's very new.
Been using this titanium cue almost 3 wks now and it still is doing fine. screw-on tips still ok. Another advice they said was to use a simple nail file to re-shape the tip now and then. It's easy to carry in the case small bag.
I was so impressed with my titanium cue, I also bought their graphite cue plus its replacement. The first graphite cue came in a crumpled long box via USpostal service. So I tested it, lo and behold, its not straight. maybe because it was piled on top with other boxes during shipment. I asked Amazon to replace it. This one came in a neat looking box via Onrac shipping services. As expected it is straight and good as my titanium cue. 13mm tip which did not break or come off. but it has blemished finish just below its ferrule.

B00MLGB3N4,4.0,"Cooling towels are a strange breed, but when you need one, you'll never regret having one,  This Chill Pal version is large (24"" x 16"") and best suited for placing around your neck during breaks.  I use mine on blazingly hot days between changeovers in tennis, but it would work equally well if you are taken out of a game, doing yard work, or moving between pieces of workout equipment.  The special fabric speeds up the evaporation of water so that it feels much cooler than the ambient air and helps cool down the body.  It reminds me of the alcohol baths my mother used to give me when I had a high fever.

To use, you wet and snap the towel.  I have no idea what the snap accomplishes, but since that's part of the directions, I do it.  The towel arrives damp inside its canister, although you need to wash and dry between uses -- and store dry.  The towel dries stiff, though, and storing such a large, stiff piece of fabric is not always easy.  I wish that Chill Pal sold this towel in a flat recloseable plastic container that could be used to both store it and carry to a tennis match.  I can fit the towel back in the tube; however, it's really tight.  I run the risk of tearing the fabric.  Instead, I use a gallon-size plastic bag.

The technology really works.  You just have to understand that there's nothing wrong with the towel when it dries so stiff that it can stand up.  Although it is machine-washable, you should let it air dry.

I think the trick is to not wring out all the water..leave some in. It won't drip on you or your shirt. Another thing i noticed was that while indoors in AC, the towel seems to ""recharge"" a little bit. I noticed several other people in the park wearing them too. This towel is awesome, I would def recommend to anyone, and the price is great.",fantastic when outdoors..it really works.,True,

The company has amazing customer service.  They initiated contact with me to see how we liked the product.

And once my face starts to get hot, my entire upper body flushes and makes it all worse. I just got this towel and now use it every time I exercise and/or take my walk outdoors. Here are all the great things about it:

-- It really does feel significantly cooler against your skin than a regular wet towel
-- It doesn't drip everywhere. I wring mine out until it is damp-to-wet without dripping and its perfect. At this level it doesn't get my tank top all wet.
-- washable in the the washing machine (I hang to dry)
-- Wearing it around my neck keeps my neck and face much cooler

B00MLGB3N4,5.0,"I love this cooling towel and have gotten multiple uses out of it. I live in a hot and humid part of the US, and we don't have central air. It can get pretty intense in the house doing daily chores, and this towel works amazingly well. When I first used it, I did not wash it 3 times as was suggested. I was to excited to try it, So I may have skipped that part. I got the towel wet, folded it, and stuck it in my freezer. Once it is frozen, it feels amazing to place around your neck in the heat. You can also use this as an 'ice pack' for bruises and sprains. I had a lot of neck pain and was able to alternate this and a heating pad to get some relief. While not in use, I recommend that you place it in a ziplock bag while in the freezer, this way it doesn't dry out on you. I also let it air dry vs. throwing it in the dryer, I feel that this will make it last longer. If you leave this out for to long, it will dry out and get hard!

B00MLGB3N4,5.0,"I purchased this Chill Pal towel for me to work outdoors and when I go on my summer trip. However,  my nephew came over in blue jeans and boots to help me dig holes for my tomato  and pepper plants. It was hot. I thought this was the perfect opportunity  to see how well this towel worked because I recieved it at a discount to review  for my honest and unbiased opinion.
I washed it and before I put it around his neck, I soaked it in cold tap water. He worked for 3 hours in the sun and said it felt really great around his neck and shoulders. I didn't  squeeze out the water or re-soak it but I think I will next time.
Because he was working in dirt and touched it several times, it got dirty. So, in the end, he squeezed water from it and I washed it in the washer. The dirt came out easily. This is a spongy  type towel with a dotted texture. It works better than the gel filled neck bandanas that I have used in the past.

B00MLGB3N4,5.0,"What a great product! I bought a couple of these for a trip to a hot and humid climate. The towels did a great job of keeping my travel companion and I cool when we needed it. It was *great* for blotting at our faces to take away that extra *shine* one gets in those kinds of environs as well. Miles better than the older type neck cooling products with the beads you have to soak before wearing which are bulky and unattractive anyway.

Basically get the towels wet, wring them out some- and I rolled them up to keep them from losing too much moisture between using them to cool off. May also be helpful to keep them in a gallon baggie if you're backpacking to a) keep them from getting other things wet and b) keeping them moist

One thing I didn't notice in the reviews I read before purchase (maybe I skimmed), is that they dry very stiff, almost like thin flexible cardboard- so they aren't easy to fold when dry, in fact I'd probably not recommend it. I've done 2 things. Folded them after washing and kept flipping them over so they wouldn't get musty until they dried (takes a while).

They dry hard and stiff so no mold issues. Used them for a golf tournament out here in Phoenix. I tossed it in the cooler on my cart and used it whenever needed. The only problem I had with it, which is more user error than anything, was that since I kept it in the cooler with water I would ring it out like instructed to do and when I went to snap it, I snapped off my pinky nail along with it.

Don't know how it holds up as we've only just got it.  Make sure you read the directions and wash it a few times first.  We didn't (as we were eager to try it out for a game) and its extremely stiff when new.  Its very difficult to soak with water from a bottle when new.  It gets a bit easier with time.  Thats about the only negative thing I can find with the towel.  Its a bit difficult to soak ""in the field"" due to the stiffness, the water rolls off.  I would suggest keeping the container it comes in and using it to pour water in to soak the towel.  As I said though, it loosens up a bit after using it for a while.

B00MLGB3N4,5.0,"I had always wanted to try one of these towels.  I live in Florida where it is super hot and humid and I couldn't wait to try this out.  When I opened the package the towel was really weird.  They call it a ""towel"" but it is a kind of weird material. I wasn't too sure about it at this point but the instructions said that it needed to be washed 2-3 before the first use.

I threw it in the wash with a load of towels (no dryer).  When I pulled it out I could already feel it had a coolness to it.  I wanted to go to step two but decided to wash it again with another load of clothes just so I could say I followed the directions.  After I pulled it out the second wash I could feel a coolness to it.  The next step is to soak the towel is water 70 degrees or below for 15 seconds.  I used cold tap water (I have no clue what the temperature was).  After 15 seconds it says to wring out the towel. Check...done.  The next step is to ""snap"" the towel.  I just took it by the end and kind of flung it out into the air.  I don't know what this snapping step accomplishes but hey I did it.

Ok after all this work.. YES!  The towel is actually cold.  Inside the AC it was really cold.  I went outside into the 90 degree heat and it still felt really cool.  It says it is 20 degrees cooler than the air and I think it feels pretty close.  When you put it around your neck it really does cool you down.

he brought up that this would be good for his head and eyes when he is down, normally I make numerous
trips switching out warm wet washcloths for cold ones when he goes through this.

summertime we would be dying of heat in the kitchen, we would roll up cold wet towels and drape over the

It's not the typical cooling towel you think it is.... this towel.. once you get it wet and snap the towel to get the excess water out and wrap it around your neck... it feels wet..it feels cool...but it doesn't leave you wet. I have no idea how that aspect works but I LOVE that aspect!

No more wet stains down the back of the shirt!

My hubby is outside alot and I worry about him getting to hot in this NE Texas weather...heat stroke is such a dangerous thing...even if you're staying hydrated! Using this...he says he feels so much cooler and it really shows. He doesn't come in feeling as drained from the hot sun!

Don't freak out though when it dries... it gets stiff...and I mean stiff...if it's not folded or rolled up when it dries it literally looks like that old staying ""my shirt is so dirty it stands up on it's own in the corner""

B00MLGB3N4,5.0,"What an amazingly innovative concept that really works!! Pittsburgh summers can be hot (yes, we DO have days where it doesn't rain, not many but every once in awhile!), this towel makes the difference for me, between calling a work out at 30 minutes and being able to keep at it for an hour. I love being able to grab my Chill Pal, drape it over the back of my neck and feel INSTANTLY cooled! I think what amazed me the most was the difference it made in how long I could work out: I would start feeling ready to call it, because I thought I was pushed to the limit but then would drape the cooling towel and be able to finish ~ it occurred to me that I was giving in on the pretense of being at a limit when it was just simply that I was overheated. This probably sounds so basic but it was an epiphany to me! My workouts have gotten longer (a lot longer), my endurance (or what I thought was endurance) has doubled, and I am enjoying the exercise! The feel of the towel is neat: it took me a few minutes to process that yes, it feels wet, no, it's not leaving any signs of being wet on me or my clothes (science baffles me). It also took me a few minutes to figure out a storage routine for my Chill Pal: now I roll it still damp, in a few hours (it's still pliable) I unroll it and just roll it the other way (so the end that was on the outside earlier is now on the inside) and then tuck it right back in the tube it was shipped in until the next time I need it or it's time to visit the washing machine.

First off I never knew these types of towels existed. When my daughter was little she hated the heat, so I would always give her a ice cold washcloth to hold and put on her head and neck to help her cool off. Something like this would have been a godsend!
The Cooling towel comes in a tube and sealed with plastic, it comes pre-moistened.  The reason for this is when it dries, it dries hard.
The instructions say to wash 2-3 times before first use. I'm not sure why, but that's what I did. And when it dried, it was crisp and hard.
Simply soak the towel for a minute or so in cold water, wring out and then snap out before using.
I cannot even describe just how this works but it is so cool...literally!
We have been having a major heat wave and this cooling towel makes me feel 10'-20' cooler than the air temperature!
Amazing to say the least. The towel is super soft to the touch when damp. This is my new favorite item!

B00MLGB3N4,5.0,"This sports cooling towel from Chilly Pal is awesome. It was shipped in a fast timely manner and was well packaged. With the hot california weather coming this towel will come in super handy. Before the first use of the towel you need to rinse the towel 2-3 time, then let is soak in 70 degree water or cooler, then you wring out the excess water snap it and you are ready to go. I go on morning walks with my little one and by the end i am super hot and sweaty. Surprisingly this towel kept me cool the whole time without making me super wet and sticky. To store towel simply rinse, roll and place it back in storage case it came in. The towel is also machine washable which is great. You line dry it or hang dry and just soak again before the next use. This towel is great and will keep anyone cool in hot weather. I am definitely going to recommend it to my friends.

You can use Instant Cooling Towel  to cool off, when wet, the reusable, machine-washable towel can instantly cool the skin for hours. Being from Texas I found this towel to be quite amazing.  It came packaged as you can see by the pictures in a nice reusable storage case.  It does seem to have a shammy type feel to it.  You just wet, shake and this towel cools down in seconds. No need to refrigerate!  Just wet and shake for the ultimate chill. A cooling towel is the perfect way to cool your core body temperature while working out in the gym, on the golf course, running, or whenever you just need a cool refreshing break. This towel does not give you a soaking wet feel, just a very damp cool sensation as the evaporative cooling process goes to work. The best thing is that it is reusable once it drys and stops cooling just rinse wash and repeat.  This is definitely something I would recommend to buy to cool off easily and fast.

I used a one time promotional code, this review is written in my own words. When I received my item I was so excited I had to put it to the test! I opened the case and fell in love with the aqua blue of the towel and the thick durable feeling. The towel felt cold and I followed the simple instructions on the case.

The towel is placed int cold water for 15 seec, then wringed out. The towel becomes a bit heavier when placed under water and then lightens back down when wringed out. The towel is great and very light weight. It keeps me cool when I am riding my bike in the hot Cali sun and also while I am at the gym working out. This towel has also helped me to remove headaches and is perfect to cool down a fever. The towel absorbs my sweat while running or hiking and is ideal to take anywhere! I am excited to take it on beach jogs and motorcycle rides. It is easy to clean and store.

I am a huge fan of this cool towel, I hate feeling hot and sweaty and this towel removes both icky feelings! It is way better than an average towel and serves many purposes. It is my best friend while I run 5Ks and I will definitely be using it for my marathon training. The color is beatiful and keeps me cool even in the hottest Los Angeles weather.

During intense workouts, my temperature can sky rocket. This towel helps out with that a great deal. No more sitting on the couch or keeled over outside drenched in sweat. This towel instantly cools you down.

The towel comes wrapped in plastic and then stored inside of a nice plastic container. The towel for me was chilled already when I took it out of the package.

B00MLGB3N4,5.0,"First time used, got cooling relief after doing a high intensity workout.  If one side started to feel a little warm, just flipped it over to the other side.  This towel looks nothing like a sponge and yet there are these little cells that slightly puff up and retain water.  This towel loads up with water, but does not drip!  It doesnt dry out fast at all, which is why its cooling effects are so amazing.  Evaporative cooling goes on continuously while its wet.

Using this wet towel to wipe off sweat and cool down sure beats using a dry towel and standing near a fan.  So, you can rinse/wash this towel and reuse.  Upon drying, the material feels stiff, but there is no problem folding it and rolling it back up.  It feels like durable material that will withstand years of use.

5) Easy to put bike on and off of the rack.

The rubbery top protects your frame from getting scratched up.

How it works: basically you just rest your rear tire on the floor-level tray, and place the read axle on the rubbery part. It's quite flexible for different size bikes, too.

Just one caveat: While I don't have disk brakes on my bike, the packaging says it's compatible with ""most"" disk brakes.

B00MV0TXJ6,4.0,"The good:

The box is easy to open, and the stand folds right out. It's relatively small, and well made. This is great if you don't have a kickstand.

The bad:

This works about as well as a kickstand might. I tried it with two bikes;  a 2002 Fuji racing bike and a twenty-year old Schwinn Voyager. It worked with the Fuji--the Schwinn wouldn't fit on the frame, because the space between the wheel and the quick-release lever isn't big enough, on an old Schwinn.  The stand itself is fairly heavy, so much so that it's not something you'd want to put in a backpack for a bike commute. The stand is also not that sturdy; you'll want to put your bike in an out-of the way place, where it won't get easily knocked over, because this stand isn't sturdy enough to prevent a bicycle from being knocked over with only a little help. (Don't put it next to a window or a highly trafficked area.)  Also, if you have wood floors, this may mark them by scratching; the stand works better on tile or carpet floors; it's fairly heavy, and will concentrate the weight of the back wheel in one place, much like a kickstand.

Having said that, if you don't have a kickstand, and you work in an office  or other environment with linoleum, tile or carpeted floors, and you can't otherwise install a bike rack or bicycle ceiling hook, this is a fairly compact, moveable solution to, ""how to hold up your bike,"" to keep it away from walls.","Great if You Don't Have a Kickstand, But, Not for Every Bike.

B00MV0TXJ6,5.0,"Really great solid bike stand. Works with both my Trek and my Quintana Roo. The Trek is a heavier, aluminum bike and the Roo is a full carbon-fiber. The Trek also has disc brakes (no problem) while the Roo has standard break pads. What I'm getting at here is that it works great on two different styles of bikes with different weights and axle designs. Keeps the bike upright and at the ready which is a real change from having to pull them off the wall before riding. Very stable and super portable. Great for those who do not have kickstands (like anyone really does anymore). Sleek and professional. Just like the box shows, this stand would be great for the office if you area commuter. You can keep your bike inside where its safe and have it out of the way. What more do you need?

B00MV0TXJ6,5.0,"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a Saris The Boss Single Bike Storage, White for review. This is an interesting item that I didn't know I had a need for, but after using it for a month now I wonder why I didn't notice I had a need for it. :)

I bike to work everyday when the weather is dry, and usually when I get into the office I just put the bike on the wall. Over time, the handle has rubbed some rubber onto the wall where I usually rest my bike. My office manager didn't seem to mind it.

At least that's what I thought.

The Saris is a very simple device. Think of it as a flat stand with a vertical fork that can hold the rear axis of the bike (the product photo is very illustrative here). The fork has some rubber/silicone coating to prevent scratching, and there is absolutely no adjustment other than the a slide lock that locks the fork in its place (when it is shipped the fork is bent towards the plate to minimize the package size).

The entire device is not that heavy, and so it surprised me a bit that in practice it is very effective in holding my bike. The fork is easy to use, and so far I have zero trouble with it.

For all these, and the fact that this is very affordable, I am giving this Saris a five star.

Let me end with my office manager. He walked by one afternoon after I started using this Saris, and he said oh, I always wished that you would install a kick-stand on your bike; this one is quite nice, where did you get it? That evening he had the custodian clean the rubber marks off the wall using glue-gone. Oops. :)","if you don't have a kick-stand, get this for your office!",False,
B00MV0TXJ6,5.0,"This is a foldable, semi-transportable bicycle stand, which means that it straddles the middle ground between portability and stability.  I don't get the sense that this is a 'maintenance stand' for triathletes and performance cyclists, but the intended audience is probably more office workers and people living in temporary accommodation who want to store their bike indoors after a commute in such a way that it doesn't scratch the walls.  For this, it works great.

From the photos, it might not be immediately clear to you how the rubber-coated 'fingers' actually hold your bike by the rear axle and at first you might worry about its stability in that it just holds the bike from one side, but it actually works well.  You can be off your bike and have it on this stand in 10-15 seconds, which is pretty good.  Then, when you move or are going to be away from the office for a bit the whole stand folds up for easier storage and transportability.  Saris advertises the stand as being ""lightweight"", which is kind-of true, though I suspect this is just a happy coincidence for them.  The overall materials quality of this is fine but nothing exceptional; what you're really paying for here is the clever design.

I've only had this item a few days when doing this review.  I think as long as I keep it indoors and dry from any water leaking off the bike it will be fine, though if it were kept outside for long periods of time or if i used the folding part regularly i think the motion and elements might take their toll on this after a while.  But after all, this is not really meant to be used outside as it is not designed to provide anti-theft security of any kind.  It just holds your bike up and it does it quite well.  Recommended with an extra plus for being made in the USA.",Indoor bike stand does the job well.  Bonus: made in the USA.,False,
B00MV0TXJ6,4.0,"Most bicycles do not come with built-in kickstands anymore. Even if yours has a kickstand, there are lots of reasons not to use it when you park your bicycle at home or in the office. A kickstand will usually scuff the floor and also makes your bike lean over a lot, thus taking more space. This Saris stand holds the bicycle upright, minimizing the necessary floor space. The smooth bottom to this stand is less likely to scar the floor and you can always put a piece of carpet underneath. Your bike doesn't lean against a wall, either, which can scuff your wall's paint and also scuff your bicycle. The rack holds your bike by the wheel, which is more durable than the carbon fiber used in many frames these days. The rack even folds up and out of the way when not in use. $40 for a nicely made-in-the USA tool is a reasonable price.","very functional, reasonable price for made-in-the-USA",False,2.0
B00MV0TXJ6,4.0,"Strong, sturdy, heavy duty: that describes this vertical bike stand. I have a mountain bike (with an electric motor attachment) that often just takes up space in my garage. It has a kickstand, but somehow, always manages to be exactly in the way when I have to move something. So this heavy gauge metal stand is just what I wanted.

The stand arrives ""unfolded"" flat, in a fairly thick cardboard box, but mine had already punched through both sides of the box. This didn't hurt the stand in any way, but might have scraped a few other things in the delivery van! I'd say the distributor needs to put more padding in the box.

Setting the stand up is a snap -- about 5 seconds that need no description. As a stand itself, it is a simple and practical thing. It keeps my bike upright, which takes up less space. I have my bike secured on it, covered in plastic, so it will take up as little standing room room as possible for the rest of the winter.

B00MV0TXJ6,5.0,"Sturdy on the floor and it was easy to assemble.  This is the kind of item that you may soon wonder how did you ever live without it.  I have an adult bike with disc brakes and this works fine for it.  Of all the options that bikers look for, this turns out to be a good one, because it is simple, sturdy, and quick to set up and use.  It will hold the bike for minor repairs and adjustments, too, which is handy.  Instead of other storage places or even leaving the bike outdoors, I could picture having several of these for both the home and office rooms, eventually.  Recommended.",Sturdy and handy to have,False,
B00MV0TXJ6,5.0,"This is a beautifully built bike rack made in the USA --- which is nice to see. My Dad, who's been a professional welder for 60+ years, says the welds are very good (he said clean) and the metal is a solid heavy gauge. He was impressed. Its 19 inches flat, 14 inches in length with the stand up, 16 inches from floor to top of the stand, 9 inches wide and it weighs 3 pounds, 12 ounces.

If you ride often and need to store your bike in your apartment or home this is a good way to go, you won't scratch up your walls and it will store it upright and when not in use you can fold the top down and push under a couch. Even in a garage you aren't taking up so much space using it. Traveling with it... its heavy, but if you need it, why not?

B00MV0TXJ6,5.0,"I store my main bike inside my garage when at home, but the garage is also where we park our cars.  I use this Saris The Boss Single Bike Storage Stand to store the bike upright so no kickstand has to be used.  The reason is that if the kickstand is used the bike leans over a lot to the left and that takes up more space in the garage than I am willing to allow.  This stand does have a small ""footprint"" and firmly holds the bike with no problems.  The stand is lightweight and could be taken with us if we take the bikes on vacation (we have multiple bikes, also stored in the garage, but they are wall mounted).  No assembly required.  Although this stand is perfect for our garage, a person using this inside their home might want to place the stand on a small rug if they have hardwood floors (the base of it is metal).",Great bike stand. Perfect for us.,False,
B00MV0TXJ6,4.0,"As a married father of three kids (ages ranging four to eleven), my life outside of work consists largely of arranging clutter and trying (vainly) to instill a sense of organization into my kids - a notion that they meet with persistent hostility.  So I may have an unnatural attraction to all things organizational.

While we are not a cycling family, the kids all have bikes.  Their preferred method of putting their bikes away consists of coming to a near stop, jumping off and running into the house as the bikes crash to the ground.  (Kickstand?  What's that contraption for?)  No threats or pleas seem to get through their heads to put their bikes away.

Until the Boss arrived.

Maybe there is something about gizmos that copnects with kids, but when they saw me playing around with Saris ""the Boss"" bike storage unit they were intrigued.  It resembles a tall, imbalanced tuning fork tipped in black - an Apple-esque simplicity of design.  When I told them it was for Dad's bike, they couldn't figure out what it was for.  Once I showed them what it did, they each instantly demanded that they get one for their own bikes - so much cooler than just using the kickstand!

So this is an unintended side benefit.  As far as how the product works for my bike, it's fine.  Other reviewers have pointed out that you probably need to be a bike geek to truly appreciate it, so I will try to point out some nuances.  First, it is very stable despite being small, which is terrific.  Second, despite the attractive pictures of the product being using indoors, note that is a metal base without rubber feet, so you should think twice before putting it on hardwood floors.  Third, if you are the kind of person who goes out for an early morning ride, you should practice lifting your bike on and off before you start grabbing your bike on the run - it's taller than you think and you don't want this product - it's a solid piece of work - banging into your shins.

Overall, this product is simplicity itself - it does what it does, very well.",Simple structure provides excellent on-the-floor bike storage,False,
B00MV0TXJ6,5.0,"Perfect for my inherited road cycle. During the cyclcing season I typically rely on some combination  of buckets, paint cans and shelving to keep my prized cycle vertical.

The real deal of this stand isn't  just that it's  at a reasonable  price point, but that it keeps my bike from taking up any more space than itself.

I had been looking for a waist pack to wear when running that will comfortably hold a water bottle, phone, and car key. The running waist pack I had been using is a little small for the iPhone 6 -- it fits but I can't easily put it in and pull it out. This is a very practical design: multiple roomy zippered pockets and a bottle holder. A 20oz Camelback podium chill bottle fits perfectly, and the drawstring and straps tighten to ensure it's secure. The pockets easily hold the phone and key with lots of room to spare -- I can even fit nutrients for long runs. I've run with this waist pack for several months now and it's been very secure (I wear it high and tight on the waist). It has also been through the clothes washer (in a mesh bag) several times (I have hung it to dry) and it's held up beautifully. Note: When you get these bags, the zippers do look like there's something wrong with them but there isn't. Just zip and unzip and the zipper is good to go. This is also a great bag for hiking and dog walking -- super deal.

This product is just what I have been looking for.  I always carry my water bottle and especially when I am walking my two small dogs it get very hard to carry the water bottle and to carry the two of them.  We like to walk the nature trails and occasionally the little ones (two Yorkshire terrier, one 5 pounds the other 6 pounds) need to be carried because we normally do two plus miles and it is sometimes muddy and hard for their little feet.  So now I have no problem carrying them and my water bottle, phone, keys etc.  The water bottle says in securely unlike most flimsy ones where they keep falling out.  This is an extremely well made product.  Small and light weight but yet a lot of room for all your stuff.  The construction is as I said great ! even the straps I to tighten it. There are two straps that you pull to tighten that work great.  And an added bonus is this pack has a reflective strip for night use.

You can fasten the belt according to the waist size to make it as secure as you like. The quality of the material was made very well, holds together strong. The heavy nylon shoulder strap is wide and comfortable to wear around your waist.  It also has a certain style that traditional fanny packs do not have, making it look somewhat fashionable. Next to the main pocket there is another ""pocket"" that can be used as a s stuff sack or a holster for a water bottle, it has mesh in it as well as a belt style cinch that will tighten down on whatever is inside however not close the compartment completely, I was able to fit a standard twenty ounce water bottle in this area with no problems.  The belt is a nice heavy duty material but it is lightweight and will fit from a small to xl sized waist.  It is comfortable to wear the back of the pouch is padded and there is mesh to let air flow.  This is such good quality  the zippers, pouches, clips and ropes.

B00NNRK9C6,5.0,"This fanny pack is perfect for when you want to run out but don't want to carry anything more than you have to haul. The brightly colored parachute cloth has rips stops to prevent tearing and is a nice weight, but not to heavy, in order to avoid adding weight.

It has a water bottle holder next to a front- zippered (with heavy-duty, ergonomic zipper pulls) pouch for essentials, such as keys, and a small wallet. This can be tightened by pulling on a strap so you don't lose the bottle when hanging upside down while rock climbing. Behind that is a slim zippered pouch for items such as documents or perhaps a couple of granola bars or green energy drink powder. Next to this section is a slim, top-zippered middle pouch for larger items, i.e.: A passport, or a heavier metal RFID wallet. And behind that, another top-zippered pouch for even larger items, lunch perhaps, or other items. The belt is securely stiched on and even has keepers...something the always seem to forget - keeps it need and tidy.

All in all, a great bargain...and it comes in 10 great colors! 5 out of 5 stars...well done!

Taking into account the dimensions provided by the seller I had imagined this being smaller. I love the size actually I think it is perfect and I am glad it came in just as expected. This bag is built to last, it is constructed of durable heavy nylon materials that come in various selectable colors, similar to basic military grade construction. The color scheme is striking to the eye and give this bag an enhanced look of toughness. It is stitched heavily and sometimes double to keep it together despite you packing it with stuff. The heavy nylon shoulder strap is wide and comfortable to wear around your waist, I am a guy that wears size 38 waist jeans it fits me comfortably with room to spare. It is adjustable to get it right to where you want it to be. Its one main compartment with three individual pockets they are all zippered main area, the nylon is fairly thick in this area so these compartment should hold up to some abuse and water resistant-ness.  Next to the main pocket  there is another ""pocket"" that can be used as a s stuff sack or a holster for a water bottle, it has mesh in it as well as a belt style cinch that will tighten down on whatever is inside however not close the compartment completely, I was able to fit a standard twenty ounce water bottle in this area with no problems.  The pack balances nicely when loaded to keep you gear stowed and not bouncing around too much when you are active.  Adorned with heavy duty plastic buckles this bag is built to take a beating. I cant say it enough, this is a well built tough accessory to add to your daily wear.

B00NNRK9C6,5.0,"I bought it for walking with my dogs, and it's working out wonderfully. I love having a belt as opposed to a shoulder pack, as it keeps my shoulders free from fatigue.

The belt adjusts easily to any size, which is helpful on the colder days when the number of layers I'm wearing can change over the course of a walk. It fits comfortably and securely  the material has some flexibility, which allows for unrestricted movement, yet I've had no issues with unwanted shifting or chafing. It also comes with a water bottle pocket, which is sensibly placed.

What I really love are all the storage pockets!  There are several zipper pouches, which are the perfect size for carrying a cell phone, keys, dog cookies, and a snack. It provides for necessary storage without being too bulky.

Overall, I love this belt and use it often. It is so lightweight and comfortable that I often forget I am wearing it. This is what I look for in outdoor gear- products that allow me to focus upon the dogs and my walk, rather than the belongings I carry with me.",LC Prime Fanny Pack,False,
B00NNRK9C6,5.0,"This is a rather cute design that also is very practical.  It has a pouch for your water bottle (yay!) on one side, as well as a multi-compartment area that zips closed.  While you can't stick a sleeping bag and tablet into the pouch, it is a very useful size for carrying the essentials such as wallet, keys, camera, and cell phone.  There will still be room for a memo pad, pen, and maybe a snack or two as well.

The belt also is very adjustable, fitting most people from child-like slender to a bit heftier than you'd like.  It's also wide, including the buckle, so it won't start digging in, even if it's carrying more weight than it should.

All of the stitching was well done, with no loose threads or crooked seams.  The zippers moved easily and seemed to be of good quality, as was the parachute style buckle.  The fabric appears to be a heavy ripstop nylon, with the belt being a strong woven one.

There is really no flaws in this fanny pack in terms of design and materials used.  It's even cute,, with a slightly unusual design.

B00NNRK9C6,4.0,"I bought the LC Prime fanny pack for day hikes or walking the dogs.  First, to explain the 4 star vs 5 star rating.  I was very disappointed in the color.  I picked the HOT PINK one and it does appear to be hot pink online.  However, when it arrived, it's not bright pink and darker pink like a dull raspberry pink.  Otherwise, I really like the pack and it's very well made.  The waist adjustment is easy and it is comfortable.  There are many pockets to hold keys, phone, dog treats, doggie bags and my camera.  There is also a water bottle storage area that snugs the water bottle tightly.  It's a great fanny pack.  For me, I now wish I would've ordered a different color.

B00NNRK9C6,4.0,"**NOTICE*** If you look back through the product reviews and watch a  video by Brandy, the name of the product changes, which means the fabrication of the product can change as well. Please note the reviews and photos do NOT all match the LC PRIME Fanny Packs - nor the sizes given in the product dimensions match. The video by Brandy also shows a completely opposite configuration and name on the pack. So just read through and make sure this is what will fit your needs.

I really wanted to love this LC Prime Koala Fanny Fack but considering everything together, I can only say the experience is ok to like it. I was tempted to give 3 stars even though I would like to give a 3.5, so I am not docking because I am hoping the issues here are just mistakes and not actual product deception. While the concept of the pack is really great and aspects of the pack seem to be designed well, mine came with two zippers that were open along the teeth behind the zipper. I was able to fix both zippers but they should have never passed quality control. I also have a loose thread you can easily see in the photos. Other than that, it has a lot of great compartments, zippered areas, hiding spots for keys, slots within the main pocket, insulated toggled bottle holder, padded waist front and large adjustable 1 1/2"" strap. I like the design of the bag and I like they padded the waist and insulted the drink spot. The padded flap that goes against the body also has a textured surface to prevent slipping and its own small hidden zippered compartment.

I chose the green color because it is my son's favorite color and I figured this would be perfect for him to use while caring for the animals and their yards on the property, walking the dogs, checking the mail, etc. We live in a very hot climate and carrying water is important so the bottle compartment is handy. It is large enough to carry a small tool kit, keys, some mail, dog treats, whistle, phone, etc , but not feel bulky. It is very lightweight and perfect for hiking, sport events, amusement parks, etc. I hate carrying purses around and this is large enough to substitute a medium purse.

Let's cover the dimensions given in the ad:

Specification:
1) Material: high quality nylon
2) Size: 20x16x6 (LxHxW)
3) Weight: 190g

I didn't want anyone to assume the pack was in inches because that would make a tremendous difference.
Since the weight is in grams, I would assume the dimensions were in centimeters. Yet, the dimensions given do not convert properly to inches measured on the pack I received.  They should convert to apx 7.8 x 6.3 x 2.3 . The photos below show the pack I received to be larger than the inches conversion. The pack I received was basically 8.5 x 6 x 3. The belt itself should fit up to a 46"" waist comfortably since pulled out at the longest equaled a 48"" ability. There should be 5 photos of the product attached to this review.

The waist strap is sturdy and can easily be adjusted to fit around any size waist. It even has stretchy elastic bands along both ends of the strap to ensure that any excess will not flap around. The plastic buckle is substantial and durable. The zippers glide smoothly and have textured pull tabs. It has a main compartment with an inner pocket, an outer compartment with a front pocket, and a small pocket built into the waist strap that is hidden behind the bottle holder. The bottle holder has a drawstring with plastic toggle and an extra adjustable strap around it. The purple color is pretty and looks really nice with the light and dark grey colors. The LC Prime logo is printed on the front in white and is rather large and in not the most attractive font.

B00NUFB7HW,4.0,"Went on perfect just follow the directions. Having a xacto knife will help out.  The manufacturer recommends covering up the mag release with the agrip. I tried this but had a harder time finding the mag release. I ended up cutting around the mag release with the xacto knife.  I also had to cut small holes to get access to the trigger housing pins. Took it to the range and could notice immediately how much better the gun felt.  I was able to ride high on the back strap with no discomfort.  The grip is very solid the harder you squeeze the ""grippier"" it felt.  When you sweat your hands grip it even  better. I think it's made out of some kind of suede leather is very comfortable. I have tried all kinds of rubber slip on grips that added bulk and would twist around.  Talon and traction grips rubber and granulated.  The granulated was too rough for my hands and the sand grit would come off and get in my holster and on my hands.  The rubber worked well but wore out and started to come load loose around the edges after a few months. Agrip gives you extra adhesive if anything starts to come loose.  After daily  carry and 1,000 rounds so far so good.  Also on a carry gun very comfortable if it rubs on bare skin. It won't tear you up like the skateboard tape type grips.  While the rubber ones were more comfortable than the skateboard grips they would catch on clothes and pull your shirt. The agrips have no issue with that.  They do collect dog hair and lint so if that bothers you is easily remedied but a lint brush in the morning before putting it on for the day. This also freshens up fibers and adds to its grip. I gave 4 stars because of the modifications for the trigger housing pins and mag release.",Best gun grip on the market.,True,3.0
B00NUFB7HW,5.0,"This particular product is unique, in that it aids in concealing your handgun under clothing while also providing a superior grip. Presently, these are installed on 4 Glock pistols, two 2nd. Gens and two 3rd. Gens, all four of which are slippery out of the box, IMO. If your hands are wet or sweaty, the unmodified grips of these pistols can be difficult to hold on target during firing, and it is only made worse in the larger calibers. This can be mitigated with a rubber slip-on grip, but once holstered, these rubber grips catch on clothing and scream that you are carrying a firearm - really bad advertisement when carrying concealed. They also leave marks on your clothing -  wherever they rub - constantly making their presence known at least to the carrier if not others. Finally, someone came up with the Agrip, and both the concept and execution are superb. In one fell swoop, this grip corrects the slippery Glock grip problem and allows any clothing that comes in contact with the grip to glide over it like silk on silk. Even when placed in a holster in a cargo pants pocket, the handgun is easily retrieved while locking the grip to the hand without fumbling on the first grab. If one's hand is moist or even sweaty, it holds that much better but is not sticky. Easy to apply, simply follow the directions provided with the Agrip and TAKE YOUR TIME in the application. Clean the application area very well as directed ( twice does not hurt )  and you should experience no problems; it you do, they are easily corrected, as the material can be removed and reapplied. Once applied as directed, it has a professional look with a velvet-like appearance, almost like a factory option. Fairly durable, these last for years without special care and are by no means fragile. It is that simple, but the changes  and benefits provided by this item are immediate and will make positive differences in carrying, drawing, and continual target acquisition. Initially upset at the price, Agrip worked so well I purchased 4 more for other pistols that are handled and shot on a regular basis. After more than 15 years of daily use, another is about to be purchased. The cost is higher now, but I am not in the least upset or bothered: it works as well or better than advertised, curing problems with pistols that were near "" perfection "" out of the box.

B00NUYWS6M,4.0,"To start, to say my grandson loves this hoop is an understatement!  It comes with two balls so he has grandma or me play with him non-stop.  Ouch!

It is really well built - metal hoop, steel spring and polycarbonate backboard make it like a REAL basketball hoop, only smaller.

Why only 4 stars instead of 5?

1) The instructions are only so-so.  It doesn't mention removing the plastic protective cover over the polycarbonate backboard.  Because the protective cover and the backboard are clear, it's easy to overlook.  Then it mentions the ""white silicone pad"" that is placed between the backboard and the back-plate of the rim.  The ""white silicone pad"" is clear/opaque - not white.  In reality, these burps get figured out pretty easily.

2) The biggest problem are the ""black metal door clips"".  They are plenty strong BUT rather than supply two sets of door clips - one for 1-3/8 inch doors (interior doors) and another set for wider, exterior doors, they only supply the wider door clips along with foam pads.  If you hang the hoop on the door stop side, there isn't a problem -BUT- if you hang the hoop on the hinge side, you cant close the door without severely bending the door.  See attached pic - NOTE: hinge side is opposite of ""door stop"" side.

Because these pads make the clips stick out about 1/2 inch beyond the door, the clips contact the door stop way before the door does.  You could ignore the instructions and place the pads on the backboard side of the door clips, but you'd have to cut them in half.  Then you could close the door, but the backboard would not be flush against the door.

A little design modification / change for the door clips and this is a 5-star unit - hands down!",Really great except ...,False,

B00NUYWS6M,5.0,"I never thought I'd expect problems with something this simple seconds after opening the box upon delivery.  First issue:  Pump and needle was not included in the box... which it should be.  Bummer, because my son was anxiously waiting to use this thing.  I called customer service and I was told to leave a voicemail.  No response.  I then emailed them, because I have seen that someone from the company comes on here and leaves comments urging unhappy customers to send an email to have their problems resolved.  So I emailed.  No response.  Again.  And it has been a week.  No problem. I had a pump in the garage and had to run out and buy a needle.  No biggie, anything for my son, but I SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO DO THAT.  Upon inflating the ball, the ball itself never took a fully round shape. There are a few lumps / indentations on the ball that refuse to go away, despite perfectly proper air pressure.  No big deal, I didn't like the ball it came with because it is way to small in size considering the diameter on the rim.  Bought a bigger nerf ball.  Today, my kid briefly hung on it after a dunk and bam - a crack running all across the plastic backboard.  It still functions, but the crack will only get worse over time.  My kid is 7 years old and weighs 60 lbs.  This should not have happened.  Now I tell him not to touch the rim when he shoots hoops.  Everything on my end, installation, handling, air inflation, was done perfectly.  I guess I just received a cursed unit.  Totally unhappy as I really wanted this thing to live up to how it was advertised.

Update:  12/11/2015
I received an entirely new unit, as promised.  The one I initially received must have been a 'reject' (the 1-2%) that somehow got into the rest of the batch.  Huge difference.  The hoop is perfect!

B00O45TRNS,5.0,"This bag changed my life and has sentimental value.

My MacBook Pro 13 inch (mid-2014 retina) fits fine and unlike others, I do like to use it this way at least when I fly since I use only this bag and a Northface Base Camp 90L to carry everything I own. The bag is high quality and looks great. I load it down as heavy as I feel like and I never worry that it will break nor do I whine about having 12 kilos on one shoulder. Sorry (not sorry) but the negative comments regarding these bags do not sound like they come from the type of people that the bag was designed to appeal to. They doesn't mean those concerns are not valid, but the star rating should somewhat reflect this, in my opinion. The company name even says ""Hard-Use"" right between Maxpedition and Gear. I'm jsayin...

However, it is such a versatile bag, that it appeals to not only military guys but all sorts of fashion minded folks (even avid scuba diving travelers) and that is a good thing. I don't mean to criticize the naysayers, but as a ""hard use"" kinda guy, I say put your lap top in it if you want to, then load it down with 20 kilos (if it is even possible) and then put full Nalgene in the pocket for even more weight.

For a compact firearm, it's a good solution to try and get a low-profile and easy to maintain grip. PGOs are tricky to maneuver and there tends to be more torque on your wrist at the low ready. The downside here is that this is much much harder to aim from a high, extended posture-- PGOs at least give you a little bit of leverage when doing a push-pull. We tried this with some game loads and I'm honestly not sure I want to handle this with a full power load behind it.

B00OHU8FLA,4.0,"i bought this for my trunk gun to make it shorter and easier to store. after about 10 minutes with a Dremmel i was able to get it to fit on to a Rock Island Armory M5 12 gauge shotgun; albeit imperfectly. there's still a fair (8th-inch) gap between the top of the grip and the top of the receiver. the gap could easily be covered up with some much-needed grip-tape; the surface of the Raptor grip is almost texture-less and much too smooth.

in practical use, i found that this grip makes it much more difficult to be accurate at distances beyond 25 yards when compared to the standard stock. i suppose that's not really what this grip is designed for - it would probably be much more effective in a CQB or home-defense application. However, with practice, 25 and even 50 yard shots are more than possible, even with slugs.

the best part about the Raptor grip is that my body doesn't hurt like it normally does after a few dozen 12-gauge shots with a pistol grip or standard stock. no more pounding shoulder pain or wrenched wrists for me!",fun and comfortable but takes practice to be accurate,True,3.0

You can't tell from the picture but the butt of the grip is actually kind of ball shaped which I think helps keep a good grip.  It seems well made and I expect it to last the life of the gun without any problems.

B00OHU8FLA,5.0,This has to be the coolest accessory yet for a pistol grip shotgun.  It's made of a heavy duty polymer.  This grip even came with the correct bolt to attach it to my Mossberg 500.  My understanding is that Shockwave also makes a Raptor grip for the Remington 870.  I would suggest that when you attach this grip to your shotgun use a smidge of anti-sieze lubricant on the bolt threads.  A steel bolt is hard on an aluminum receiver.,Cool Accessory,True,

B00OHU8FLA,5.0,"Ever since watching Supernatural as a teenager I have wanted a birds head grip on a shotgun.  However, the internet is full of forums and videos of people blasting them (no pun intended) as useless novelties.  So I just used regular stocks on my Mossbergs for the longest time.  But eventually, I got that itch again and decided to try stockless shotgun grips.  The two products I tried were the Raptor Grip and the Knoxx Breachersgrip.  After shooting both I quickly decided that the Knoxx was indeed a tacticool gimmick and not worth the price (it costs 2-3 times as much as the Raptor Grip and is quite inferior of a product in my mind).  The Shockwave Technology Raptor Grip though is no gimmick.  I was able to shoot VERY comfortably out of my Mossberg 500 and my Maverick 88 with it.  Birdshot, 00 Buck and even slugs (though accuracy on slugs is not very good with just a bead sight and no stock lol) were all really quite tame.  For that reason alone I have given this grip 5 stars despite its one flaw.

And that one flaw is that it doesn't come with a sling attachment.  Supposedly, that is so that the end user can decide where to install the sling attachment him/herself.  Which is fine but it still is slightly annoying.  If they had included the necessary parts for the install I would drop this as a flaw but as it is, Im not much of a DIY'er so I just go without it.

Still, when you are able to fire full power shells without a stock and not cry over wrist pain later, you've got something really great on your hands.  5/5!",Fantastic Grip!,True,5.0

B00OI5XQE0,5.0,"Let me start by saying that this is a hefty chunk of steel. I honestly don't see any common round type causing any damage to this thing.  I expected it to be slightly bigger but the description is accurate--so it is my fault for imagining it as a full size silhouette. Honestly, the size is not much of an issue for my application.  I think the design should be changed to eliminate the ""head"" area and have a more rounded rectangle shape, as the head portion is unreasonably small.  Although again, my application allows for this size (if I can make quick accurate shots to the small head, I can obviously do so on a larger target). The head is about the proper size for the brainpan so no harm no foul.  The powder coat seems thick and even but I haven't had it out to the range yet to test its resilience--although, I don't expect anything out of the ordinary.

I got 3 days of painfully cold ice/water by adding a bag of ice and 2 Cooler Shocks to it, and probably could have gotten 4-5 days if I hadn't dumped it out. The ice/water was so painfully cold my wife refused to get cans out on the drive home. Fantastic cooler, tons of insulation, easy to clean/pull out liner, looks great, and keeps ice like a champ. I looked at getting a Yeti Hopper and realized that putting ice into it would be a pain as it doesn't open wide at all, plus the teeth are not friendly to arms.

B00OJHLT14,5.0,"Excellent cooler! Compact, easy to transport, easy to carry when full. Tested this puppy July 2 - July 9 on the beaches of Destin and it was a success! First I must say that the temps were blazing in the mid 90's every day. It was a pizza oven on the beach. Packed cooler with 18-20 16oz aluminum cans of Bud Light and Mich Ultra ( wife beer) each day. In and out of the cooler all day and then carried back to condo with a few straggler beers left zipped and when I opened it the next morning to pack for the day there was still at least half the ice left. This happened every day. Keep in mind that this was zipped, unzipped, not zipped properly by the wife repeatedly throughout the day.
A few more added benefits: It doesn't sweat, AT ALL. When I say it doesn't sweat at all, I mean there was not a single drop of condensation located ANYWHERE on the exterior of this cooler, Sand would simply brush off with your hand because the cooler exterior stayed completely dry.
The bottom has a reinforced non skid coating. I'm not sure what the material of this is but it works like a champ.
The hooks on the canvas straps located on the small sides of the cooler can be used as bottle openers. The wifes aluminum can beer actually had pry tops, not twist tops, so these came in handy in the sand.

B00OJHLT14,4.0,"I did my homework before i put in my order for this cooler. I needed one for a specific purpose,in the bed of my Polaris RZR in a cooler holder were it gets extremely warm from the engine underneath. It was between this cooler and an AO cooler. This one got my vote as soon as i seen the colors,matched my RZR perfectly. I also needed one that could get wet and dirty and also be easy to clean,i think this will fit the bill perfectly. The only downside is that i would and did have to wait a while for it. A month an a half to be exact but amazon and polar bear did pull through. The quality on this to me is top notch and can see this lasting for many years. Havent been able to give it a ""test"" yet because its January in Wisconsin here so i will have to post an update later in the year about the performance.

Will have to comment on a couple things though.""China"",cooler is made in China! I just thought for the price of this cooler that it was made here in the USA.The other thing is as I am writing this,i noticed that the price has went up almost $35 on this orange cooler! I paid $80 which i would say is worth it but anything over $100 would have turned me off and I would have probably went with a vinyl AO cooler,especially if you have to wait 2 months for it. If a company is going to charge a premium price for their product,i better be available,in my eyes. I will say that i could not find this cooler for any cheaper than $100 on any other site so i must have gotten a good deal.

In the end. I am very happy with the look and quality but Polar Bear really got me with the styling,plain and simple. From what i have read and having it in my hands,i don't see this not performing above and beyond expectations at keeping things cold. Only time will tell.

UPDATE: since i my review on this cooler i finally got to use it for what i bought it for. A rough,hot,and dirty ride in the back of my RZR side by side down some northern wisconsin trails! I can honestly say that i was impressed along with everyone in our group(2 of them bought polar bear coolers and had terrific results also).Used it for three days in all,putting a fresh re freezable ice brick in it each day. The longest day was about 8 hours in the bed of my RZR.That day my drinks were still cold and had one when got back to camp! Keep in mind,i have a plastic storage box that is right next to cooler that is sealed from the elements.i went into that several times to get items,including a rain jacket that was on the bottom and it was ready to melt to the bottom of storage box! So it gets hot back there but the cooler performed great,was completely covered in dirt/mud/sand and washed up great,ready for the next ride.",Worth the wait!,True,21.0

So overall I like it with one caveat. The one issue so far is with the velcro straps used to attach it to the handlebars. They are WAY TOO LONG. When you try to tighten them so the bag is tight against the handlebars, the loop section of velcro is past the hoop section. So in order to secure the velcro, it ends up sitting very loosely on the bars and hangs down sagging forward. I ended up cutting the velcro straps off and using large plastic zip ties instead.

Ridden once in light rain and it stayed dry inside. That was a light drizzle, not a downpour.  Rain heavy enough and long enough would probably seep in.

Because I give it four stars, don't think it is a bad, though. It just seemed to me that with a slight modification to the design, this unit could be ""one star"" better!
The description says it comes with two built-in pegs to help secure it to the ground, but both these pegs are on either end, and while they do work to peg into the ground, at least two more could easily have been strategically placed around the shield to make this much more substantial in a breeze (which is why you are using it in the first place)
Because it is so tall, a stiff breeze will place more pressure on it to topple.
(Let me add, mine has NOT toppled...yet. But, those pegs are worthless on a picnic table)
But, the tall plates are what you want if your cook system needs it, and all the plates give you plenty of room to surround your ""stove""

B00T6PELHI,4.0,"Foam rollers are one of the best self care tools to ""work out"" much of the tightness in our muscles. Whether this tightness is a result of postural imbalances, overexercise, or just the stress that our muscles endure on a day to day basis, a 5 or 10 minute rolling session can do wonders.  When i worked out at the gym i would often end my workouts with a stretch and a roller session but since cancelling my membership i don't have a roller and haven't had a good rolling session in a while. I saw this roller at a good discount and bought it right away. This particular roller is as described;a functional foam roller.  Does the job, has the requisite stiffness and roundness, and is compact enough to be stashed away in a pretty small spot (make sure you know what size roller you want this one is 6ish inches in diameter and 18 inches long- on the smaller side but still VERY functional). The color pink is believed to stimulate energy and as this isn't and overly bright pink the color feels bright and fresh;it gets the blood circulating.

We used it in a very large, standing-room tent and, not surprisingly, the fan was a little weak when hanging from the peak.

We left the fan on all night and it was still going strong the next morning. It it relatively quiet, no rattles or whines.

This is a good light for just leaving on while gaming or handing out is says the light lasts something like 30 hours, and I believe it. If you need BRIGHT light this would probably disappoint, but we love it for keeping a light on a long time and when we need bright light we use another light which is more harsh and goes through batteries faster. The fan, well I suppose if you were desperate you could stick it right beside you for a tiny bit of reprieve, I would think it's better than nothing. I really did like the way the hanging hook folded out of the handle sadly that became a point of failure in the design and broke on our first camping trip, but over all we do appreciate the design of these lights and for the price they can't be beat!

B00TRRTF6C,4.0,"This product is a good lantern and fan combination. I use it like a ceiling fan and ceiling light inside my tent. Though the hook is a bit bulky and I had to attach a key ring to the loop the tent manufacturer included in the center ceiling of the tent. This modification was necessary because the hook on this lantern wouldn't fit the loop. The simple addition of that key ring solved that problem well.

The light fills the tent sufficiently. I would not say it's super bright, but it produces enough light to get the job done well. The fan is adjustable so you can aim it as you like even while it hangs in the center of your tent's ceiling. This is nice for making sure you get some air flow on you. The angle of the light is also adjustable.

Unfortunately, this fan and lantern is a bit heavy for backpacking. It's also a bit too bulky and awkward for carrying in a backpack on a hike. You can fold the handle down, and you can try folding the light up, but that's not going to help much. It's not that you can't carry it in your backpack on a hike, but it's not designed very well for that. It is less than ideal for weight and size for hiking. Basically, this lantern is not great for backpacking, but it is pretty good for camping.

This is not even considering the weight of the two D cell batteries which it requires. And if you're going to be out on the trail camping for a few nights, you'll need some extra batteries. This is not so bad, though. I have a 3-panel photovoltaic power generator, and a portable powerbank in order to keep my smartphone charged up. So, I got two sets of two rechargeable D cell batteries, and a 2-bays portable universal battery charger. Oh, and a cable to connect the universal battery charger to the powerbank, USB 2.0 male to DC 3.5 mm female.

It's not a bad device, but it could use some improvement. It's both a good lantern and a good fan.

Now, why the hell does this backpack feel so heavy? Lol","Great at the camp, not great for backpacking.",True,3.0

B00TRRTF6C,4.0,"PROS:
Light is bright.  It lights up my whole 10'x10' tent.
Light direction can be angled independent of the fan
The fan is pretty quiet
The fan moves enough air to have a cooling effect as long as you are less than 5 feet away from it.
It last for a few nights on one set of batteries.
The fan has two useful speed settings.

CONS:
The light dims and flickers a lot when the fan is on.  Enough so that I would say it is an 8 out of 10 on the annoying scale.
The fan is really only good for one person, maybe two if you angle just right.
When you hang it by the hook from your tent, it swivels around randomly due to the off center weight and inertia of fan.
I dropped it from waist height to dirt ground and it broke into several pieces.  I was able to repair and reassemble with some super glue.

B00WTI66UO,5.0,"So now I know. Swim goggles made in Italy are usually considered to be of superior quality. I can see why with the Skylights from Cressi. The adjustable strap fits them comfortably and snugly on your head. The seal is excellent, field of view exceptional, and the don't fog as quickly as other goggles I've used. I like the mostly opaque white color too. It isn't clear on the sides, but it is light rather than dark which seems to aid vision overal and give them a more ""open"" feeling.

B00WTI66UO,5.0,"I never realized that, like good red wine and gelato, most quality swim goggles are made in Italy.  Well, now I know.

No one here is a competitive swimmer, and we are strictly freshwater swimmers--the park pool or Lake Michigan, specifically. Therefore, I can't evaluate how well these work in a marine environment.

Also, we have several styles of goggles around the house, both with the traditional design and the full-mask type. I much prefer these larger-view goggles as opposed to the ones with the individual eye pieces. The field of view is much broader and the clarity seems better, too. I am very near-sighted and I no longer wear contacts, so every little bit helps (....said the little old lady as she p**d in the sea! I thought that phrase was sort of relevant here.)

My go-to goggles are very much like this pair. In comparison, I will say that these are easier to adjust. The seal is just as tight, though that's with a very brief, at home trial run. They're lightweight and comfortable.

The case is just okay. There's no lock or clip to keep it closed, and you definitely want to keep these secure while they're in your gear bag.

B00WTI66UO,5.0,"I really like these Cressi Skylight goggles for casual swimming - I can't go au naturel because I wear contact lenses.  What I really like about these things is that they are like a comfortable Muumuu for my eyes which is a good thing.  I'm not sure if my eyeballs have gotten fatter as I've gotten older (probably) but the old school tiny goggles dig into my eye sockets and hurt worse than ever.  Enter these Cressi's - ahhhh.

I really like the fit on these Cressi's as well - the straps are very adjustable around your noggin and they create a very good vacuum seal that stays on when I swim casually (I can't speak for competitive swimming).  Heck even my kids have used these for snorkeling (when I let them) and they really like them better than their cheapo toy store masks they had been using.  The build quality is excellent and has been durable thus far.

In conclusion, I like these Cressi's and my eyeballs thank me.  I'm not going to be competing in any Olympic swimming trials anytime soon so these are perfect for my needs.  I see this product page on Amazon has various Cressi offerings and the Skylight model dimensions appear to be on the smaller side - I am happy with this size and wouldn't go bigger (yet).  At current price of $30 I think these are a good value relative to other options that I see - overall 5-STAR rating from me in consideration of price/value.",Like a comfortable Muumuu for my eyeballs,False,2.0

They are Made in Italy, and at the current price (just under thirty bucks) I think they are very reasonable / affordable.",Case Included,False,
B00WTI66UO,4.0,"These are obviously not your typical goggles, and I wish I owned them when I was on a swim team. These are more a mix between goggles and scuba masks as for how they fit.  They have a really good seal, but it actually made my face feel tight for awhile after I took them off.  That good suction kept the water out of my eyes, however, without any fogging, and that's what one wants in a good pair of goggles.  At least there was no nose bridge irritation due to that silly plastic piece that keeps most goggles together. I could never seem to adjust both that plastic piece and the straps to a comfortable fit, which is null with these goggles.

Another benefit is the bigger, slicker straps, which do not grasp my hair like normal swim goggles.  The strap is easily adjustable, but the tab to readjust holds only one way. You do have to pull, so no worries about them coming loose when you don't expect it.  The carrying case is a nice feature, even if it is a bit bulky.

Construction and adjustments are a step above typical cheap goggles as well.

Look and work great, no complaints.","Looks good, fit great.",False,
B00WTI66UO,5.0,"I really like these. The older I get the more I become aware of the risks of injuring your eyes, both in an acute way with an impact threat, and also a more gradual degradation by exposing your eyes to possible contaminators. At the shore where I grew up they now have the nasty habit of dumping sewage into the ocean, which raises the bacteria count. Once it hits a certain number they ban people from swimming on the beach into the ocean. I wonder what the effect is when swimming when it is at its upper limits approaching a ban.

Okay enough about the paranoia protect your eyes logic. Let's talk about the function aspects. These come in a very nice clear plastic case that is not water tight. It is designed to allow some air to enter through two small portals. That is advantageous because trapped moisture is not desirable. On the other hand the goggles are the best fitting set I have ever experienced. The secret is in getting the tension on the strap just right. Once the strap is set right, even if  you are wearing them on a dry face they absolutely make a perfect seal. I have a rather large head at 7 3/4"" and when I took them out of the container I was concerned when I saw how I couldn't get them on with the factory retracted setting. Once I let out the band and got it set right, they went on very easily. What is impressive is how tough it is to get them off if you want to just pull them away from your face. You get the feeling that you are going to suck your eyes out that is how tight of a bond they create. The secret is to grab a spot along the trim and gently lift just the lip away, allowing some air to get in, then they remove quite easily.

The other thing that is worth mentioning is that these are actually a fashionable fit. We all know the person with the mask and snorkel on, with a mask so squishy that it deforms their face. Well this one, once you set it right doesn't do that. I wouldn't say it is more fashionable than not wearing one, but as swimming goggles go this one is the least obtrusive.

I grew up spitting into the goggles in order to clear the fog. These come with a fog resistant coating, or material built in. Only time will tell how effective that remains. So if you are interested in protecting your eyes, and you should be, and also want to swim and see clearly underwater then these are highly recommended.",Fit well and stylish too for a set of goggles. Great for protecting your eyes.,False,
B00WTI66UO,5.0,"I use a Cressi mask for diving and they work great. These do as well. They fit snugly around my face and there are only two obvious differences between these and my diving mask. First, and most obvious, these are goggles and not a mask. Basically, that means that they fit across the bridge of the nose rather than enclosing it. Second, the field of vision of my mask is superior, in particular if I try to look down through the lower rubber area. If you're wearing these to swim laps or compete in a triathlon, that won't matter to you. Among the uses I plan for these are to wear them as eye protection for some cutting, sanding and cleaning operations. Normal eye protection is nice, but sawdust and other fine particles always seem to find a way around my safety glasses and get into my eyes. These things seal so well, there's no chance of that occurring. For that purpose, you can never have enough peripheral vision and I wish these were a little more clear around the edges.

If there's any issue at all with these, I find the fit almost too snug. They seem to suck in to my face enough to create a vacuum effect that can feel uncomfortable over time. I may get used to them, find an adjustment that's snug enough for my purposes but a little bit looser than I wear my diving mask, or decide that these will only be used in the water. Only time will tell.

These goggles come in a hard plastic box. My mask box seals completely, but this one has a couple vents that will allow water to evaporate out, but also could allow foreign objects in. One will have to be aware of that for transport and storage.",Nice goggles for those who don't like the traditional little ones.,False,

B00ZX5GVA0,5.0,"Purchased this glove because the son was aging out of his old 11"" glove.

Pros -
  I gotta say, Rawlings is a great brand (if not the best) for gloves.  I purchased other brand names and can't help but regret not buying a Rawlings...well not this time!

  I like this series of glove because it has a padded spot for the palm to cushion hard throws that may land on the palm.  This can be quite painful if it's not properly padded.

  Functions great, looks great, and son enjoys using it.

Cons -
  The glove is not fully leather.  The back is actually synthetic or such but definitely not leather.  Funny thing is, the son actually thinks it's ""cooler"" like that so who am I to argue?

  The glove was stiff on arrival so I had to break it in.  After a couple of uses (and wrapping a ball around it when not in use) it started to soften up and close nicely so it's fine now.

The top reason I bought this cart versus any of the others was for the big wheels.  I use it to go back and forth to our backyard pool.  It therefore goes over grass.  I've had carts with smaller wheels to only fight with the cart to move and then they eventually break off.  This has lasted.  I can't imagine using any cart with small wheels on sand, which would be worse than grass.

The bag is netting, so when we put the pool toys back into the bag, they can air out and dry.  I either hang towels of tubes on that white chair thing that folds out on the other side from the handle.  That allows me to reach it from the pool when I park it right next to the pool.

B013CHE7O2,4.0,"I bought three different sizes of the Milliard peanut ball after our gaiam peanut ball exploded while our son was bouncing on it.  I had noticed that several reviewers had mentioned sizing issues, and I can confirm that is indeed an accurate problem.  Because I need the peanut ball for a wide variety of therapeutic goals for out little man (I even use these some with his NMT stuff), it was important for me to have a size he could work with, but this product hadn't had any reviews mentioning exploding, so I figured the smallest of the balls could go in his room for bouncing if he woke up and wanted to do that in the night, etc, and the medium sized one could be a back up in case something happened to the size that worked best for him for therapy.  Our son is 5 and has a few things going on with him, one of which is a genetic disorder that causes him to be a bit taller then average for his age.  We inflated the balls on day one and added additional air the next afternoon, as specified in the product instructions.

So our green ball measures 19 1/4 inches by 33 1/2 inches,  Manufacturer states it should be 39 x 20. Our yellow is 16x 30, manufacturer says it should be 35 x 17.  Our blue is 16 x 28.5, manufacturer says it should be 31 x 15.  So all of them are off, and all of them are smaller then advertised.  He will bounce on all of them, but he prefers the green one, and of the three, the green and the yellow are most workable for our therapy targets. I'm not really seeing any shape distortion.  So, you may want to order a size up from what the manufacturer recommends you will need for your child.  I think the green one is fine for adults still, depending on the height of the person and what it's being used for.  It's an ok height for me, but I'm 5 foot 3 inches.

They also do have a bit of an odor for those who are sensitive to smells, but for our little man, it's not really causing a problem for him.  He was actually just super happy to have a peanut ball back.  I would have preferred to not have 3, but again, I wasn't sure on the sizing based on the reviews and I didn't want to have to play the return it game, and I figured it might not hurt to have a spare anyway in case one of these goes ka-boom as well.  Aside from bouncing, his favorite thing to do on it is lay on his back and roll back and forth and push off with his hands. It helps calm him down, and it's good for his upper body muscles, so I love that he loves that and I'm hoping these really are as burst proof as advertised.  If not, I will update.  but for now, just a heads up on the sizing.",All three of ours measure smaller then advertised,True,

I haven't had them long enough to review the second part, but I will say it's great for the first.  They arrived and I blew them up easily with the included pump.  I noticed a slight bump on one of the balls and was/am worried that it will break there, so I emailed Milliard and they were great - said they would replace it if it burst.  I didn't want to return it as it could last forever with that bump, so I appreciated their response.  Anyhow, gave them to my daughters, who have SPD.  What a great purchase.  They use one of these in OT every week, and are great for getting the girls to use their core, by laying on their stomachs on the balls and then having them play games or do puzzles out in front.  They are also great for my oldest who loses focus and can't sit still during homework.  We have her straddle the ball like a horse and sit at a short table and she is able to concentrate and work while bouncing and rotating/rocking on the ball.  My youngest uses the smaller one to hang out in that stomach down position, so she's getting great core and balance work and doesn't even realize it!  Overall, we really like these and they are sturdy and were so much less expensive than the brands you see at OT places.  We bought a 2 pack and it was a great deal.

If you were to measure it diagonally from top left end to bottom right end, then the distance approaches 28 inches... but with foregrip, torch, red dot or reflex sight mounted on rails, there is no way for our firearm to actually fit into the case at the same angle as that diagonal measurement.

Going straight across from side to side, the case is 27 inches (external) and 26.5 inches (internal, from zipper-to-zipper). Please feel free to review the pictures we have uploaded.

The firearm we planned to use with this case is exactly 27 inches long... so we have to push it as far as it will go towards the diagonal, and even then it is a bit of a task to get the zipper closed. Tight fit, but we can get the case closed. Not sure about how the tension will affect the lifespan of the case material or zipper.

If your firearm is under 27 inches long, actually preferably under 26.5 inches and not overly bulky on either end, then this case would probably be excellent for your needs.

I carry a knife along with my firearm for personal defense and the knife also serves as a tool a lot during the day. I have tried at least a dozen different knives. SOG, GERBER, Benchmade and others. I am also a U.S. Army Veteran and my favorite color is digital camo. So when I saw this knife, I just had to try it out. Well I am really glad I did! This is one very hefty, well built knife! And you cannot beat the price!!

First the assisted opening works like a charm. A little pressure on the blade tang and it opens and locks in place ""FAST""! See the video I posted of opening and closing it. The blade lock works very well and I will put it through some extended use and see if it lasts. But I can open and close the blade no problem with one hand, and do so in the video to show you.

The size of the knife is great! What I really like is how wide the knife handle/body is. much wider than many of my other knives. Wider than my SOG and Gerbers. But I like it, it fits in my hand better! The handle/body has very good finger groves init and the thumb rest on the blade tang at a very good angle to prevent injury when stabbing with it.

The knife is equipped with a built in blade to cut things like seatbelts and small cords. What I like is the blades are fixed and not the blade of the knife. So they could be used even when the bade is open. Although tha is not a necessity, its a nice feature. It also has a glass breaker on theend, and its a big one, sticks out enough to be used a a personal defense weapon. In your fist, if you were to need this as a striking weapon and not a knife, it would really do the trick, kind of like a sharp kubaton.

The clip is tight and has a strong spring so far. Keeps it where you put it on your pocket. A nice little touch is the circle i the end of the clip, which could be used for a lanyard if you want.

The drop point, partially serrated blade is nice, I would like the choice of non serrated, but this is a nice one nonetheless

The knife is hefty, feels really nice in the hand when closed and open. And I love the digital camo, US Army emblem on it.. If you are looking for a inexpensive, well built, nice knife for everyday carry (EDC) and one that feels good in the hand and is an assisted opener, this is the one. I am actually going to buy a couple more at this price to give as gifts to a couple of my veteran buddies, and co-workers who saw it and really liked it!

We have a couple of balls in the house and need a pump like to this so that we could blow up the ones that have lost air in them. This was much easier to use on them than I thought it would be. The handle on it has some silicone or rubber like material on it so that you can get a good firm grip on it while you are pumping. The air flow blows out smoothly in the needle into the football that we had to inflate. This moves smoothly so you don't have to use heavy force. The needle is long enough so that you can use this on almost any ball. This is small enough to fit into a backpack or sports bag so that you can have it with you if you need it. I love that this comes with two extra needles so if you lose one or if one get broken, you will have an extra. The needles are very easy to change because all you need to do is screw it off.

B01561ZVXS,4.0,"This is the third hydration running belt that I have reviewed (all different brands). This is the first one I have reviewed that has the water bottles slanted.  I never tried one of these before because I was always worried that the bottles may leak.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that they did a great job of not leaking.  I even took one of the water bottles out, and shock it really hard repeatedly over my hand to see if any water would come out.  Not one drop leaked.

This running belt features 2 BPA free 6 oz. water bottles,  2 storage purchase, 2 reflective strips on either side of the storage pouch, and 2 elastic cord loops that you could have a small sweat towel hang from.  This belt fit me great (my hips measure 34).  With the belt fully expanded and not stretched it measured about 34. If I stretch it as far as it will go I can get it to stretch about 59.

The storage pocket which is made of neoprene is quite roomy.  It will definitely fit the largest of cell phones.  There is a separate pocket in front that is mesh on the outside.  This would be perfect for keeping your keys separate so they don't scratch your cell phone.

Both water bottles are strapped in around there necks with an elastic cord to keep them from falling out.  The one issue I have with this particular belt is that my other 2 belts have a fabric tab on this elastic cord that makes it a lot easier to pull the strap off of the bottle when you are running.

Pros:
-2 BPA free 6 oz.
-Reflective material
-Adjustable
-2 storage pockets
-Water bottles do not leak even though they are slanted in the pockets
-2 elastic cords you can hang a small sweat towel from
-60 day satisfaction guarantee
-Great price
-Comfortable
-Light weight
-Heavy duty clasp
-Easy to take on and off
-Well made

-No reflective material on the back side

B01561ZVXS,5.0,"I've been using this belt weekly for my long runs (8-10 miles).

Initially, I had some concerns about the water bottles because they have like a loop (similar to elastics one would use to tie their hair back in) that helps hold the bottles in place. At first, I thought to myself, ""I'm not going to stop and secure the bottles in place with the loop"", but thankfully, the bottles will stay in place on their own without that loop. The bottles themselves are fine and I haven't had any issues with using or cleaning the bottles. You don't really want them much bigger than what they are because they'll weigh more, and if you need more water, you'll want to look at using a hydration pack of sorts.

The pack held my iPhone 6 just fine. Once the belt was tightened, there wasn't any sort of bouncing from the weight of the bottles, my phone and keys around my waist. I would've liked a small hole for my earphones, but having it stick out of the zippered top worked fine. I haven't used the belt in a race yet, so I didn't use lace locks, though they do work fine and adequately held a standard race bib. I know you can wear the belt facing forward (as pictured by the manufacturer), but I prefer mine in the back, so I'm not sure I'll use the lace locks anyway. The neoprene was soft and light. The zippers worked fine and didn't get caught on the fabric.

Overall, this is a solid running/hydration belt. It's indeed light and the pockets are big enough for your phone, keys, wallet and a snack. The water bottles will stay secure with our without the elastic loops. Definitely recommend.

It's also small enough that you can pull your shirt over it and not look like a total dweeb while you're running through the world.  The armband holder is ok but to be honest there are another versions that work better.  Still its a good to have as aback up just in case you need it.  Lastly it came with a glow/ flashing reflector thingy that was fun to wear but I'd rather avoid running in the dark so I use it sparingly.",Works great - good size for medium to long runs,True,
B01561ZVXS,5.0,"I purchased this Running Hydration Belt with Water Bottles by Outdoorsman Lab so that my wife would have her own belt with water bottles to wear for outdoor exercise (more for long walks than running). We are avid outdoor enthusiast and frequent campers and hikers. Carrying water comfortably is always of top concern.

The area of the belt with pouch and bottles is neoprene and appears to be of good quality. It comes with 2, six ounce BPA free water bottles that don't leak when jostled. The water bottles sit at a slant making them easier to remove and replace while moving. I would have preferred larger bottles but these will be adequate if the hike or walk is not too long on hot days.

There is a larger pocket with a top zipper opening. This pocket is large enough to hold my iPhone 6 with a case but will not hold my wifes Samsung Note 3 in an otter box case even with the front cover removed.

There is a shorter mesh pocket, also zippered, on the outside of the larger pocket (but is a separate space from the large pocket). This pocket is large enough to hold a couple of energy bars or keys and credit cards.

The strap is nylon, adjustable and has a large sturdy buckle. My son, pictured has a 30 inch waist and the belt fits him well. My waist is 36 inches and it fits me well. My wifes waist is..like her age, just right, it fits her well also.

There are 2 elastic loops with a draw sting for carrying race bibs, microfiber towels, etc. The belt has a reflective emblem with the name Outdoorsman Lab and has 2 reflective stripes, one next to each water bottle.

There are elastic loops that can be placed over the bottle spouts if bottle bounce is a problem. One con is that there is no pull attached to the loops to help get them off of the bottles quickly and easily. You have to role the elastic up and over the bottle top to remove. This can be a little trick if they are behind you but pretty easy if wearing them on the front.

You have to stick a finger in the loop and stretch it to replace it over the bottle top again. It is not terrible and she probably will not use the loops anyway so it will probably have low to no impact on us.

B01561ZVXS,5.0,"This is a pretty cool set of running accessories.

In order of usefulness I would say that the fluorescent armband with variable light settings is number one. In the wintertime when odds are that runs will happen in darkness I make this my constant companion for visibility.

The running belt itself is good. The highlight for me are the water bottles and I use this whenever I feel a little dehydrated going into a run. Talking itself is very generous, but when my keys and possibly might phone are in this pocket it feels like there is too much weight on the belt and I do not enjoy running with it.

The armband is okay but if I did a little tight around my arms. It seems to hold my iPhone 5S well although the arm with is a dealbreaker for me so I do not use it often if at all.

I love that he does it but have always hated the in and out for water breaks and I worry about my MP3 Player being dropped as well as his safety. We live on a street without streetlights so when he walks around the yard I get nervous that a car won't see him if he steps onto the road. Yesterday he received the running hydration belt with water bottles package which also includes a smartphone armband for my phone and a LED bracelet for his arm, wrist or ankle

The belt has two water bottles which can each hold 6 oz of water. I love that the bottles lie slanted. My other belt has the bottles sitting straight up  and they always poke me or my arm sends it flying. The slant keeps them completely out of the way. There are two zippered pockets and the belt is completely adjustable. I could wear it as well as my 12 and 10 year old.

The arm band is for a 6S/6S Plus phone. It is completely adjustable and has a place for a key. Love that....and will be borrowing for the track. He said it was really comfortable, even over his sweat jacket.

The bracelet had a strong smell when I first took it out of the bag but it went away immediately. I love that the band isn't just but also has a button that allows for three different light modes. You can have it solid, quick or slow flashing. I feel way more comfortable now that he can wear this.

This is a great set for hikers, walkers, joggers or just kids who want to walk around at night and listen to music",3 Deals In One - Perfect For Anyone Who Likes Being Outdoors,False,

B015HKIKFE,5.0,"After looking at various devices, I narrowed it down to the best seller the Gripmaster and Sportsgrip.  I'm glad that I found the Sportsgrip before I got the Gripmaster.  What made it stand out was the ergonomic shape, rubber cushions, looks and color of the x-tra hard version. Then the other decision was choosing the right tension which took me a while to finally decide on this one.  I'm also glad I chose to get the x-tra because I didn't want to have to buy another once I got use to the lighter tension models.  This is not as hard as it makes it out to be and I'm no muscle man and I have no issues with the x-tra hard.

I love to jog around my lake and listen to music. But when it is hot sweat pours in my eyes and standard headphones become uncomfortable. When I came across these I thought it was too good to be true. These Bluetooth headphones connect great and the controls are easy to use. The band is very comfortable and is not itchy. It absorbs the sweat and holds it away from the skin. The sound of the headphones is great. The speakers are huge and pack a loud and clear sound. And they look great!!!",Great Headband with Bluetooth headphones,False,
B015KHSU6S,5.0,"It seems like there are as many Bluetooth headset variations as there are people in Finland (says the guy who recently got back from a vacation there). This particular variation, the Rotibox Bluetooth Headband, brings some much-needed practicality to the category.

Instead of having molded ear pieces or over-ear hooks, these headphones make use of a comfortable, stretchable band. Befitting a sporty headband like this, once you remove the electronics, it's fully machine washable.

Of course, this form factor has other benefits beyond working out or other rigorous activities. For instance, these will also stay on and remain comfortable when laying down, although you won't want to do so on the side of your head where the actual electronics are.

In the package, you get the headband, microUSB charging cable, and instruction manual. You'll get up to 6 hours of play time on a full charge of about 2.5 hours thanks to the latest Bluetooth 4.1+EDR technology. I had no issues pairing this headset with my Apple iPhone 7 Plus.

Volume/Previous Song; Power On/Off, Play/Pause, Answer/Hang-up/Redial; and Volume/Next Song controls are on the right side of the headband.

The Rotibox headband is available in a range of colors and styles. I'm reviewing the green. It looks nice and sporty.

In terms of sound quality, since you're not inserting anything directly into your ear cavity, these definitely don't sound as good as ones that do. Nevertheless, sound is clear with a modest amount of bass. While these are anything but high fidelity, they definitely get the job done. Calls were similarly clear, with no issues to report on either side of the conversation.

If you prize comfort and versatility, these unique Bluetooth headphones are well worth checking out.

Pluses:
- Does a good of staying in place
- Machine washable
- Clear sound, even at high volume levels

Minuses:
- Can't lay your head down on the side comfortably
- Sound lacks a bit of punch

Sound quality good and it's great to be able to not have something sticking in my ears for a change and yet be able to be on the phone or listen to music, and still be aware of the sounds around me. The only challenge was that the two speakers on either side are kind of high on my ears so I kept pulling down the hat trying to stretch it out so that I could get the speakers right where I want them.

B015KHSU6S,5.0,"I was not sure I would like the speakers in the headband as I have long listened to music when exercising indoors - and earbuds when possible outside.  I have a more nobly proportioned head than some (23.5"") and wear a 7 1/2 hat.  The headband fits snugly but is not uncomfortable and is printed in some sort of camouflage pattern.  The speakers fit directly over the ears - the band is pretty stretchy and would take a head larger than mine - or smaller. The sound is clear with no buzzing or distortion evident.  It lacks low end bass a bit, with the midrange and the highs being much better.  And since this will be worn for exercising I don't think I will really be that critical as to the sound.  I wore it twice while lifting weights and once while cycling in my neighborhood (Only about 15 miles) and there was no movement.  It does catch sweat a good bit but you can remove the speakers through an open slot in the back.  I believe that this would be better for walkers than cyclists as the helmet does not fit that well.  You can continue to hear the surroundings, though, unlike an in ear bud.  Anything you can do in a gym would be fine for this. The range for me is about 30 feet.  (Years ago I worked for a place that made 'panic button' type devices, and we discovered that women generally would transmit further than men - often a lot further.

This Bluetooth headband thing is really cool!!! Granted I got this during the summer and its practically useless this time of the year! I look forward to using this during the winter when I am outside shoveling snow for my mom and her neighbor.  They have really long steep driveways so its always a long time in the cold to get that done.

The headband is really comfortable and warm!  The Bluetooth headset is also really good, loud, and clear.  The syncing process for this is extremely easy and even comes with instructions and a USB cable!

The good:
 Very warm
 Easy to set up and use
 6 hour play time
 built in microphone!
 External controls for music

 There is really nothing negative about this!!!!

They have a nice amount of stretch that allowed the headband to fit around my head comfortably. I didn't have to readjust at all during my workout of circuit training, walking, and a run.

As you can see in my brief video, they come in a two pack.  One is black and the other is multicolored with salmon, blue and grays. A really great combo that matches a lot of my workout wear.

These headbands are braided together and therefore much thicker than your average headband and will last a very long time.  Additionally, they have great stretch to them so they will fit nearly any sized head.

My favorite part about these is the ""grippies"" that cover the entire bottom of the headbands.  This allows it to stay securely on your head and not slip off.  It worked fabulously.  I didn't have to adjust it once while out on the trail!

B015QBQC9A,5.0,"I purchased the solid black and multi-color headbands and I love these Active Sports Headbands by U-Are Products.  I have tried many sports headbands and haven't found the right one that actually stayed on while I ran. My daughter also wears these headbands during her basketball games and she loves them because they actually stay on while she plays.
Pros: The non slip-grip on the headbands have a silicone lining on them to make them stay in place.
  The material is very well made and definitely seem like they will last awhile.
  You can wash these in the washing machine! I am happy about that because it is more convenient.
  I love the look of the braided headbands and are not too bulky. The width is 1 inch.
  They are comfortable to wear after I stretched the elastic a little bit. They don't give me a headache after working out for a hour and
  half.
Cons: The size is a one size fits all so, at first the headband seemed tight on my head but, when I stretched the headband it was fine and
  fit a lot more comfortable on my head.

B015QBQC9A,5.0,"I have a love/hate relationship with headbands. I like to keep hair out of my face, and its always getting in the way during exercise, but most headbands slip off my head really easily, or are so tight they give me a headache. So far this set of headbands has been great though. I like the look of them - the braided strips are fun, and I like the colors (I got the set with a solid blue headband and the multicolored grey/black/white headband). I love the grey and white one because its interesting to look at without being too flashy. These headbands are tight, but not so tight that they give me a headache right away, and I do want my sports headbands to have some tightness to them. I haven't had trouble with the headband slipping off right away either. I think my head shape isn't great for headbands so very few stay on, but the width of the headband and the fact that there is rubber grip across the whole width on the inside helps this one stay in place. I don't have to wear it quite as far forward on my head to keep it from slipping which I really like - most sport headbands have to sit right up on my hairline to stay in place, and while I cant wear this one too far back, I can put it about an inch behind my hairline and it stays in place. The headbands are nice and stretchy so they would fit many sizes, but not so stretchy that they are loose. They are just nice reliable headbands, and Im glad to have them!

B015QBQC9A,5.0,"This set of headbands is getting a lot of use in our home.  They are perfect for both casual and athletic events.

Now, on to some other great features which include a beautiful woven design.  I see no way, short of a scissor cut, for these headbands to become unwoven.  They are extremely well made.

The nose bridge is anti-slip and the temples snugly fit the sides of my head.  The wrap around is perfect and there is no distortion of my vision while wearing these.

I like the look.  It is definitely a racy sophisticated look that goes well with a wide variety of styles.  I'd wear these, but so would my sons, and given my 25 yr old son's reaction when trying them on, I may have to make a phone call if they go missing  :) .  They come in a black bag that feels like a good quality lens cleaning cloth, but the package also includes a small cleaning cloth as well.

The lenses tend to look quite gray on the product listing, but I've found these to be more of a blue.  While it's blocking out the harmful rays, it does not leave you with diminished vision and I could see everything quite clearly.  They aren't as dark as they look and so you can wear these well into the evening.  I wore these into direct sunlight without a bit if problem with artifacts [refractive elements] in the plastic lenses that often plague less expensive [and sometimes even very expensive] sunglasses.

I think this belt will not sag like the leather ones have.  The buckle is quite secure.  The belt holds all my holsters better than ever, whether ITB, paddle, clip, or deep concealment.

B017KU2WUS,5.0,"Wow! This is a sturdy belt and the sizing is spot on! I was skeptical about their sizing chart recommendation about only needing two up from your pants size, rather than actual waist size, since most all pants sizes are numerically smaller than one's actual measurement. For instance, my actual waist measurement is 36"" and I wear a 34"" in jeans, which are still loose enough for an IWB holster. My logic told me that I would probably need a size 38 belt. That just happened to be the one size out of stock, so I went against my gut feeling and ordered a size 36 belt exactly like the size chart suggested. It fits perfectly! I'm using the middle hole, leaving me lots of room to adjust if I gain or lose weight, or decide to carry IWB. So follow the size chart and order 2"" up from your pants size.

The belt is very strong and supports a SW Shield perfectly. No sag, no rolling over. The hole spacing at 3/4"" is ideal. I had no trouble finding a hole that was comfortable and snug enough to pull the gun in close. The belt is sturdy enough you can likely get away with having it just a little less tight without sagging if you carry a small pistol like a Shield or similar.

We'll see how it holds up in the long haul. I'm optimistic it will last quite awhile. The price was certainly reasonable too.",Really is as good as they say it is,True,3
B017KU2WUS,4.0,Great product,Four Stars,True,
B017KU2WUS,5.0,"This Superbio Indestructibelt Black Gun Belt is AMAZING! The polymer construction really does look like leather (looks great with work pants and dressier professional clothes), is amazingly stiff and supportive for items like holsters and ammo pouches (should you choose to use it as a gun belt), and seems absolutely sure to last several years. I haven't owned it that long, but I've owned a lot of belts and I can tell just by the feel of this thing that it is extremely durable. I believe you could actually pull a car out of a ditch with it. Certainly, you could use it to support your entire body weight without stretching out the belt holes or abrading the attractive black surface, which are usually the first points of weakness on most leather belts I've owned. It is only slightly thicker than a normal leather dress belt, but probably five times stiffer. It still has adequate rotational flex to be comfortable when you sit or bend over, yet is extremely rigid against any potential sagging, which means that it distributes the weight of holsters or other attachments over a much, much wider expanse of your beltline (and more belt loops) so that it doesn't cause your pants to sag at those points where a heavy item (i.e., firearm) is attached. Trust me, this is a huge improvement over even a relatively good quality store-bought leather dress belt.

Another awesome feature of this belt is the 3/4"" spacing of the holes. I saw other reviewers comment on that and didn't expect it to make a big difference; however, compared with the more standard belts that use 1"" spacing, it really does make the belt feel like it can be sized more precisely for a better fit. Again, I'm impressed.

I've seen other gun belts, but haven't ever owned one because I always find them too expensive (often $80+). At $42, this belt is an outstanding value and a good choice for anyone needing a high-quality, attractive, durable belt--regardless of whether or not you plan to use it to carry a firearm. It's simply a phenomenal belt. Highly recommended!

[UPDATE 12-13-16: I've worn this belt every day for three weeks and I love, love, love it. It's by far the most supportive belt I've ever worn, not only because of its stiffness, but also because it does not gradually slacken/stretch the way most leather belts do throughout the day as they get warmed by your body and/or exposed to sweat. I snug it up in the morning and it holds snug all day. And when you need to wear something on the belt, such as a CC holster and pistol, its stiffness gives amazingly even support that distributes the load around your entire waist, rather than tugging downward noticeably where the weight is concentrated. It's terrific!]

[UPDATE 4-14-17: Almost five months later and wearing it every day... WOW, this belt still looks brand new! It has taken on a bit of curvature from daily wear, but the stiffness and the visible look show no signs of deterioration. You would think it is a brand new belt. I've never had a belt even remotely as durable as this, but at this rate, I wonder if I will ever need to replace this belt. It seems impervious to wear. For its purpose, this is one of the best value/quality products I have ever found. Seriously, get one. If you thought pricey leather belts were durable and supportive, wait until you try this.]

[UPDATE 10-11-17: Starting to sound like a broken record, but... it's been about a year of daily wear now--and I mean EVERY day. After all that time, this belt still looks, feels, and functions like new! It is amazing. Nothing else I've ever tried (of the hundreds of belts I've owned during my life) even comes close. I love it.]","Phenomenal! Stiff, durable, comfortable, attractive, and a remarkable value! What's not to love?!",True,11

B018060RNU,5.0,"This is a great hat. My son loves going out at night to listen to music but we live on a street without street lights. I get so nervous and call his name every few minutes because I worry about the road and also because I need to see him for myself. This hat makes it easy for cars to see him walking on the side of the yard but also for me to spot him when he is outside.

I bet it is great for camping, jogging, or anytime you need to keep your head warm and need both your hands free.

He says it is keeps his head very warm. Actually he came in to tell me it keeps him too warm. We are having a warm winter this year.

The only problem I see is that you need to take the hat off in order to turn it on. I cannot find the tiny switch attached to the power box for the LED lights without looking at it. The switch is tiny. Even viewing it I found it hard. The box is black and the switch is also black. It would be great it it was a white or red switch. Anything but black.

The power box fits right into the fold of the hat right under the lights. You don't even feel it there it is so small.

Powerful lights!
Very Affordable.",Perfect For Outdoors When You Need To Go Hands Free,False,7
B018060RNU,5.0,"This is a black knit hat with 5 front LED lights. Tucked in the rim of the hat is a wire connection to the LED lights and battery case (with an On/Off switch) that holds 2 CR2032 Lithium Batteries. The battery case fits in a loop that keeps it from moving around. With the rim unfolded, it's about 11"" long. With the rim folded, it's about 8-1/2"" long. The hat is about 6-1/2"" wide. It's made out of acrylic. The lights are brighter than I expected. I could actually see all the dust in the hard drive on my computer and cleaned it out with an air can while wearing this.

It comes with batteries. I opened the battery case by releasing two tabs. Here's the downside - I had to guess on the correct way of opening it. There is no instruction manual. I ended up breaking one of the tabs and I had to close it again using scotch tape. You can change the batteries when these go out. They can stay on for 24 hours. 2 new batteries on Amazon are between $3-$4. Then I wanted to see how the LED lights come out for washing. That square in the front doesn't come off. It's sewn in. Inside the rim there is a hole about 1/2"" long. The 5 LED lights are almost an inch long. You have to back it out of that hole being careful of the wire that's attached to the LED lights. This is a little awkward, but I managed to do it in a few minutes.

I like how this hat fits. It feels comfortable and looks cool. Perfect for bad hair days. I'm normally not a hat person but I enjoy wearing this.

B019D74E48,4.0,"Got two -one for my 16yr old youngest son and my 50 yr old husband for Christmas. They were out the door minutes after unwrapping them. It took about 8 minutes for my very athletic husband and 10 for my son but they were whipping it on both level street and then inclines. It takes proper foot placement, correct hip swivel for momentum, and relatively flat ground because it doesn't appear that this thing has a brake. They've gone to the local skatepark and some parking lots and have a lot of fun. They challenge and help each other. It's also nice to watch my sexy hubby get out there and work those swivel-hips. ;)  It's sturdy, comes with an extra wheel, and it's a challenge to master. All of that adds up to a good time for the last two ""boys"" still at home. I'm glad I got them this board.

The learning curve is not that bad if you have a good flat surface to start on. If you have any skateboard experience you will be fine, so don't be unsettled by the lack of wheels... I will say that it is a little expensive, and the rip sticks are essentially the same thing, but this looks like a surfboard and even has a stomp pad so it was worth it to me hahaha.",This thing is simultaneously a ton of fun and death on wheels,True,6

They only bad part is the space between the seat cushions aligns exactly with my coccyx which means I have to do a different type of sit-up but I've been able to work around the problem.

B019XBR03Q,4.0,"A decent product, but base opening is large. I had to modify every one of these type holders to safely accommodate a ""GSI"" type 24oz mug / cup to cook over the flame.

Empty, it weighs about 0.3 lbs...very light compared to a propane or coleman fuel set. I'd suggest using denatured alcohol since it'll smoke less.

B019XBR03Q,4.0,"At about half the price of a Trangia stove, this is a good stove and I like it a lot.  However, the pot stand is only going to be useful for you if you have a bigger pot.  This is NOT a good stand if you want to carry light or if your pot is not at least 6-7 inches in diameter at the bottom.  The stove functions very well, but I had to make a different stand for my kit.",Great stove but the pot stand didn't work for me,True,4
B019XBR03Q,5.0,"I'm going minimalist so wanted to lighten the load. I have tested this stove out.  I am using a tin 28 oz tin can as my cooking pot and water out of the tap.  I first measured 1 oz. Yellow bottle heet and let it burn out.  From light to burn out was 18:22 seconds.  I then filled my tin pot with 2 cups of water and again filled the stove with 1 oz of yellow heet. 2 cups of water got to a rolling boil in 11:52 minutes.  It used .9 oz of fuel so almost all the fuel was used to boil the 2 cups.  I then relit the fuel and  let the fuel burn off and it finished the burn at 16:50 nearly 1 1/2 minutes less time as when it wasn't burning alone.  I then retested the boil time on 1 cup of water after the can had cooled off.  1 cup boiled at 8:52.  I weighed the amount of fuel it used.  It used 6.5 oz of fuel to boil the one cup of water.  I relit again and the burn time was again right at 16:50.  I know it seems like these times are off, but anyone who has ever used one of these stoves knows that the last minute of this time the fuel is lit but it is not burning strong with little heat I would say that legit burning hot enough to cook stops at about 15:30 per ounce.

For my setup, this was nearly perfect.  A 4 inch wide tin can works perfect on the stove base.  However the stove base will not fit inside my tin can nor will it fit inside a 750ml Toaks titanium pot.  You would actually need to go up to the 900ml toaks pot if you wanted to nest this stove and base in a toaks pot.  Bottom line about the base is I will be looking for a different base that is just a bit smaller.  That said this base is solid and held my pot without any issues.

The stove works well.  I can only surmise the first burn time was longer because it was the first burn ever on this stove and it didn't get going as fast so less fuel was burned on the light up.  I should say I live and tested this at 4800 ft above sea level.  The stove and burner work well and you shouldn't be afraid to buy this stove.",Tested and works well,True,5

I simply used my old stale denatured alcohol I had around that I bought from Walmart, and couldn't believe how well this little stove functioned.  I'm uploading a video for you to see it in action, but note that I didn't use a pot lid nor primed the stove for optimal cooking temperature at an ambient temperature of 75F. I boiled water several times and even made a ramen using the alcohol stove with just one fill!  What I noticed with this stove is that secondary combustion kicks in for more efficient fuel burn, and this design works much better than a simple dish method.  In fact, I have another wood burning camping stove that also comes with a plate/dish insert for alcohol fuel option, but that didn't burn nearly as long. Although I have other lightweight butane/propane stoves that could boil water faster in two minutes, I prefer to use this stove because the fuel is so inexpensive and the flame is gentler on my camping cookwares.  I do recommend this, especially since it comes with a cooking base, seal-tight gasket cover, and a very useful flame regulator at a low price. The only criticism is that I can't use my smaller lightweight camping mugs with the stove base/stand, so the cookware needs to be at least 3 7/8"" in the base diameter. To get it to work with my narrower mugs, I ended up making a cross-shaped wire piece to place on top.

Update:  If you're going to use this stove indoors, be sure to use clean burning fuels such as Bio Ethanol or Green Denatured Alcohols with high ethanol content. I've been going crazy using this alcohol stove indoors but soon realized that using various commonly available alcohol fuels create toxic fumes that are very hazardous to health.  Avoid high methanol content and dirty burning isopropyl alcohols unless using outdoors.",Awesome little stove!,True,34
B019XBR03Q,5.0,"This is exactly what you would expect from a lightweight alco-stove. I can pack this within a 32oz Stanley pot, along with extra fuel, spork, spare lighter and scotch brite cutoff pad. At least enough for a 3-day trip, self-contained, in the Stanley.

About five hours after I first put the ice in, I still had ice...so I filled it up with water so I had ice water the rest of the day.

I think whats happening with the folks that say theirs doesnt work is they have either washed it in the dish washer...or theyve dropped it...or it was defective when they got it.  Im betting on the first two though...if you wash it in the dish washer or drop it, either of those can damage the vacuum seal and therefore no longer insulate the contents.

Lid is over engineered, it is definitely not easy to clean.

the designer might have no nose..this is the worst part of this bottle.
I always bring handle up when tried to close mouth cover by mistake because mouth cover is inside..
it's better keep handle in mouth side.
This mouth is not really high flow rate but you can still suck it to get more drink.

I think 24oz is a good size for 16.9oz + ice. or 20oz + ice.
This holds drink cool very well so that if you put ice a lot, ice won't be melt so fast so that you have less liquid to drink.
better put cold drink with less ice.

Washing it also instantly fixes that but I often drink water and coffee the same day. Keeps things hot and cold for hours.
I have gone out on the frozen lakes up in NH and been out there for hours in freezing conditions, and I still got to enjoy my hot cup of coffee hours later.

Pros
- Does not leak, even when it goes flying across the seat in my car or hits the floor.
- Stays hot for hours even in freezing conditions.
- Keeps water cold
- Texture of the bottle is good, and does not slip.
- Rubber anti slip pad on the bottom
- Can take a hit hard, it fell on concrete on its lid while fill and you cant even tell.

Con
- Wish they used a thicker paint for the exterior or maybe even rubberized. Not sure how that would hold up in a dishwasher but I have some scratches in mine from it sitting in a kayak and it rubbing on sand.

B01BEX7MOI,4.0,"Overall, I am impressed with this bottle. I drink a lot of cold water and carry a beaker around all day. I used to have an 18oz Thermos, but found that I had to refill it too often and also I went through 3 lids as the spring release button broke way too quickly each time even through normal usage. The dimensions of this bottle are not too different from my Thermos, other than it being a bit taller, but it holds 24oz instead of  18oz which makes a nice difference for me. My only complaint is that this bottle does not seem to keep my water cold for as long as the Thermos did. I normally add a bit of ice in the bottle, but find that the water has reached room temperature within around 8 hours as opposed to keeping it cold for the 24 hours it claims. The reason I still gave it 4 stars is that I normally go through the bottle in less than 8 hours, so this is not a massive issue for me and also I love the thoughtfulness that went into the design of the lid. It has everything I wanted and more. The water flow is excellent, it is easy to clean, it has a foldable carrying ring, it is easy to use the bottle one handed, it really is leak proof and I love the  mouthpiece cover and lockable sip button.

B01BEX7MOI,5.0,"Let me start off by saying I have the kind with the cup for a top. That being said, truly a phenomenal themos. I enjoy a nice cup or six of mat in the morning and this bottle keeps water hot (and I mean hot) for hours and hours. Some times, the water I warmed in the morning will still be at tongue burning level eight to ten hours later.

Pretty resilient (I dropped it, many times, sometimes even, quite literally, down mountains. Doesn't stand up straight but still works great). Only issue I've had was the adhesive connecting the metal to the plastic of the cup came off but the Avex customer support was INCREDIBLE. Sent me a whole new bottle. I still use the old one because it has the NOLS PNW logo (how else am I going to let everyone know I did NOLS?????) but plan to switch when this one breaks.

The 360 pour thing really is incredible. Pretty handy for alpine starts when you haven't gotten caffeine and just want some coffee but don't want it on yourself (a problem I had with the old, single stream thermos I used to use).

B01BEX7MOI,5.0,"Former owner of a Kl**n K**teen which blew out it's stainless steel bottom when the swim bag got left in the car for longer than expected during a bitter cold snap a few winters back.  Been limping along using the now round-bottom thing but after a couple of years, it just got to be too tiring having the thing fall over whenever I set it down at the gym or pool.  Not that people didn't get a laugh out of it (or me . .  . or both . . .) but KK just didn't cut it for me.

So off I hie to Amazon to do my due-diligence before putting out hard-won shekels to get something new and, hopefully better.  And I couldn't have done better than this AVEX.  I love the thing.  Easy to use.  Truly leak-proof (the KK wasn't unless you replaced the spout every six months),  Hot does really stay hot (had to try it just to be sure) and Cold really really does stay cold even when I leave it in  my truck in the summer (or fall, the way things have been this year). Sturdy.  Dependable.  Suitable for multiple types of beverages.

AND it has a nice snap-down mouth protector, a low-profile carry-ring as well as a 'safety-lock' (kinda like one on my old hunting rifle) that makes it impossible to accidentally push the release when it gets banged around in the work-out bag on the way into and out of the gym/pool/locker room.  I got the big one because I need the extra hydration (long story, we won't go there ....) but there are more dainty sizes for the ladies or small sippers.

So I was looking for replacements for the plastics and saw the AVEX FreeFlow Autoseal.  Luckily for me they sent me one to test in exchange for review.  I was super happy to try it out.  (Though orange is honestly not my normal color choice...but it's growing on me.  Easy to see on the bike.)  So I have bottles for cycling, soccer, running, work and trips.  And a different bottle for each.  Yeah, I'm nuts.

The good is that the water stays cooler MUCH longer than in the plastic bottles.  Nice on the long hot bike ride or hours on the field.  I miss the nipple from the Camelbak.  The Avex is great and looks better for work (it's honestly a little strange sucking the nipple during a work meeting), but on the bike it's a bit less convenient.  It's also very light.

I will be looking for something else for my bike, I'm just paranoid about hitting my teeth after riding 30 some miles in the sun.  But for regular use, this Avex is great.  I love this.",Great alternative to those worried about the oil chemicals in the plastic bottles.,False,4
B01BEX7MOI,5.0,"I love this cup/bottle.  I use it 5 days a week all day long.  I like having a cold drink and not worrying about a sweating cup.  I have yeti cups and they are great, but I am always worried someone is going to steal from my truck.  I prefer this over my yeti when i travel.",Awesome!,True,
B01BEX7MOI,5.0,"I have so many of these types of thermos bottle/cups.  I am always searching for a perfect one.  The AVEX FreeFlow is the closest to perfect that I have found.  I love that it is 24 ounces.  I can fill it once and sip from it all morning.  It definitely keeps the coffee hot and I haven't had any problems with drips or leaks.

It has a removable, easy to clean lid.  This is really important if you drink dairy products in your coffee or sugary drinks from the this bottle. You can easily get dish soap in all the right spots and spaces to remove any potential breeding material for bacteria. There is a handle for attaching the bottle to a carabiner or whatnot during your commute. And there is a locking mechanism to prevent accidental spills. The side of the bottle have a very slight texture to them, so the bottle is easy to grip even when your hands are sweaty or wet.

The mouth piece is nice and large and easy to use.  Nothing hits my nose as I drink, and that is a definite plus. Even the handle at the top tucks away nicely into the lid.  The literature that comes with the bottle says it will keep hot things hot up to 28 hours and cold things cold for 9.5 hours. I can vouch that my coffee was still warm 24 hours after I poured it into the bottle.  I haven't tested it's cold capacity at this point.

The only downside with this bottle is that it keeps the beverage REALLY hot.  So if you drink you tea/coffee black, it will take hours to cool down to the point where it is drinkable without burning you.  I wish there was a way to lock the mouth hole open, so that it would cool faster.  I find that I either have to remove the lid completely to allow the coffee to cool OR I have to add a couple ice cubes to the bottle before I seal put the lid on.  So honestly, that's not even a real problem.","Without a doubt, the best thermal bottle on the market!",False,

B01BEX7MOI,4.0,"This is a great bottle if you're like me where for various reasons your bottle often ends up in various positions through the course of a day - sideways, upside down and every other angle in between. For this reason, consider me a big fan of AVEX's latest bottle redesign that places a premium on leak proofing with 3 layers of drip proofing (the spout cap, the button pressed auto seal and a bolt lock) to insure a leak proof experience no matter how rough and tumble your conditions are. The bottle is also very handsome in its design with a rugged chic quality that looks great no matter what color set you choose.  The bottle is also designed for all day insulation in mind with a rating of 10 hours insulation on hot liquids and 29 hours for cold. I can't really speak for it's heat insulation as I just use it for cold water but on that front it really does hold up for my needs. My typical routine is to fill it up with ice in the morning and then I top it off with water. The liquid remains ice cold with so little ice melt that I can refill the bottle another 3-4 times throughout the day with ice still remaining even on the 4th refill.",Great bottle for those in need of proper leak proofing,False,
B01BEX7MOI,5.0,"This is my second Avex Autoseal water bottle and while the first was a great water bottle this one is even better.  I'll outline the changes here:

*  Lockout pin - you can now push a pin in the lid to lock the valve in the closed position.  Handy if you have the bottle in a backpack and run the risk of jostling the bottle enough to get it to leak.
* Carry clip is now pinned - unlike the old handle which just clipped on to the lid the new handle is now pinned to the lid which is much more sturdy.
* Rubberized bottom.  Protects the bottom of the bottle, reduces clinking when putting it down and keeps it from slipping around.
* Vertical sides - now has a more traditional water bottle profile as opposed to the ergo shape of the old bottle.
* Powder-coated paint.  Trades the anodized look for a rough textured powder coating similar to the Hydro Flask brand.

Retains the very effective Autoseal mechanism, cap, in the lid and double-walled insulating capacity

I really like this water bottle. I was really excited to try the AVEX water bottle after reading the description, as far as keeping cold drinks cold, it really does work. It's really refreshing when you wake up in the middle of the night during this really hot summer and reach for a drink of water, and the water is ice cold!! Not lukewarm or room temperature but ice cold! I do admit that the ice melts faster than I expected in this water bottle but I allow my drink to get slushy and then pour it into this water bottle. I haven't tried anything hot because I'm not a coffee drinker, I mainly wanted this water bottle for cold drinks. There is no metal aftertaste and is very easy to clean. It is spill spoof but the button that you use to open the bottle can be a little hard to open at times. All in all, is this a perfect water bottle? No, but it does keep the drink cold and that was what I wanted. There are a few little issues with this bottle but when it's time to replace it, I will be buying another one.

B01BEX7MOI,5.0,"Love this little bottle - I have started carrying it with me everywhere and have found it to be so useful.

- Really easy to clean the cap.  I use half and half in my coffee and the caps of these things can get pretty gross pretty fast.  I don't need to look up directions anywhere to disassemble and assemble the cap, so that means I actually keep using this thing.

- Insulates like a charm.  Hot beverages stay hot overnight, cold beverages too!.  I especially like having a fizzy cold mineral water in this bottle for easy sipping.

- Does not retain tastes.  I switch from water to coffee to water again and I don't want to taste what came before.

- Easy and quiet to drink from the spout.  The design for this portion is awesome and very easy to use without a loud sucking sound when you drink from it, like some other autoseal bottles.

- Cover for the spout is super easy to use.  Just in general, the cap is engineered well (NOT OVER ENGINEERED :))

I really like that I don't have to return to the car and drink from a hot plastic water bottle.  I take this with on all errands (leave it in the car), and also to the office.

B01BEX7MOI,5.0,"I want a water/drink bottle that keeps the cold cold and the hot hot.  Avex's FreeFlow does just that.  With its double-layer insulated design,  your cold drinks will stay cool and quenching for a day.  Your hot drinks, for 10 hours.  Also important for these type of all terrain bottles is that your drink flows when you want it to, but not when it gets accidentally knocked over or tipped upside down.  The FreeFlow uses an AutoSeal technology. It has a plug that looks into place with an easy to push pin.  This is great for traveling when you won't be opening the bottle for long periods of time.  Unlocking the pin still keeps it sealed, but now when you push the button at the back of the bottle (180 degrees from the drink opening), it hinges bag the plug and you can drink away.

B01BEX7MOI,5.0,"This is just about the ideal water bottle.  Like many people I've been concerned about what I've been seeing regarding the chemicals in plastic bottles leaching into the water we drink so stainless steel seems like the way to go.  I know it's a little picky but one thing I don't like about the steel bottles is the clanking noise they make every time they hit something.  Which tends to happen a lot while you're hiking.  This bottle has a coating to it that reduces that noise, insulates it and provides a nice firm grip also.  Another really nice touch is the rubberized bottom so when you set it down on a hard surface you don't get the noise and it feels more solid.  I've owned a couple of other Avex bottles and this has the same high quality feel to it, especially with the lid mechanism.  It's a great bottle and I recommend it.  My only (slight) regret is the color I picked.  It's very, very orange but at least I will be able to find it easily if I leave it on the side of the trail!",Great bottle - very high quality!,False,
B01BEX7MOI,4.0,"I've been a big fan of Thermos double-walled stainless steel water bottles for a while now, but recently I've been annoyed with some of their faults. When I saw the AVEX FreeFlow, I thought I'd give it a try, even though I'd tried a previous AVEX and really disliked it. I'm glad I gave the new FreeFlow a try, because it addresses nearly all the problems I had with my Thermos water bottle.

The lid definitely has a lot going on. There's a loop, locking mechanism, spout cover, and the button to release the seal. On the underside, you can push a tab that releases parts of the mechanism for easier cleaning. I hand wash the lid with soapy water and let it dry completely before putting it back on the bottle. The sides of the lid have a grippy material that makes it easier to open and close tightly. The all-plastic lid of my Thermos wasn't hard to open or close, but I realized right away with the AVEX FreeFlow just how nice it felt with the grippy sides.

Water flows well out of the FreeFlow and is leak-free. I like the spout cover for hikes, though, the bottle is a bit on the heavy side to carry on long hikes. Water stays cold for hours, but I haven't tested it side-by-side with the Thermos. The great thing about a double-walled water bottles is that they don't sweat, so you don't have to worry about ruining your table or desk. AVEX took it a step further and added a rubber base to the bottom of the bottle. This might actually be my favorite feature. Most, no, ALL of my stainless steel water bottles are bare metal on the bottom. My kids' Kleen Kanteen bottles look like crap because it's dented up and now it barely stands up straight. A couple of bottles that I only use have also been dented on the bottom from accidental drops and like my kids' bottle, it doesn't rest flat on my desk. The rubber base of the AVEX FreeFlow not only keeps the bottle from sliding around my desk, but it should keep it stable, even if the rest of the bottle is dented up.

If all the great features weren't enough, I think the AVEX FreeFlow looks great too. The orange one looks fantastic. The only negative thing I can say about it is that when I have the bottle full water and ice, it can be a little hard to drink, because it doesn't balance well when you're holding the top to engage the autoseal button. When I drink anything out of a bottle, I usually hold it near the middle, not the very top. You get used to it, though, and I don't think it's a huge deal. It's not cheap, but this might just be my new favorite water bottle.",Great features and it looks great,False,
B01BEX7MOI,5.0,"I previously received an opportunity to review another AVEX bottle that was exclusively for cold water.  I loved that item so much, I have purchased two more.

I was offered the chance to review this item, which is meant for both hot and cold items.  I received the somewhat hideous, yet completely cool orange color.  I love the color actually.

After washing out the item as recommended thoroughly, I inspected it and tried to understand the differences between this and my other two items.
Essentially this has a lock, a peg you press to allow flow, and the mechanism inside is different in that the device can be pulled off to allow for a thorough cleaning.

As to use, this claims hours of ability to keep items from getting hot or cold.  As yet, I have not tried a hot beverage because for coffee I have another metal container I use (Stanley).  But, while this does keep water cold for a long time, I am not sure about the claimed 19 hours.  Maybe 10 (?).  But what do I know?

Overall:  This is a pricey item.  No doubt.  However, the quality is pretty apparent.  Extra features like a lip guard are very nice, and the possibility of putting this on a carabiner is useful, though not for me.  Given that I purchased two more of these items should be an indication I think the price is worth it because the bottles have lasted a long time and it sure does keep the water cool, even in a hot car.

B01BEX7MOI,5.0,"This is a very high quality bottle. perhaps one of the best features is that it DOESN'T SWEAT.  I live in a very warm, humid place and a cold water bottle can easily get all of my gear wet as it will sweat.  But this AVEX bottle doesn't sweat.

It has a lock, which I'm not sure I really need, but I suppose its nice.  The ring on the top is suitable for use with a carabiner (which you would provide separately).  If you don't have one, I would recommend you buy a ""nite ize S biner"", there are a lot of different choices.

You need to push down a button to get free flowing water, which takes some getting used to.  I have an older Avex bottle with the same button so I'm already used to it.

I usually only have water in my bottles because I don't like to clean them.  If you want to put something else in this bottle (like coffee or tea) I wouldn't recommend it.  First, you better have a separate cup so you don't burn your mouth.  Second you would need to have a bottle brush and you'd have to clean the ""lid"" with the push button and everything.

It has a non slip bottom. When you take off the lid you can pour ice cubes inside and your drink will stay colder longer even in the sun. The top has a nice build with a groove your thumb wraps around the bottle allowing your pointing finger to rest on the press button in back for when you want to take a drink. Be sure to vent before holding near your face if you are drinking a hot beverage, a little steam will pop out. There is a small silver lock you slide over to keep the dispense button from opening if you have it in a bag or something. A flip top cover for the drink spout to keep it clean and a carry loop that folds out of the way when not in use. To clean the lid you can flip open the drink spout inside the lid to wash.

B01CDDH99Q,5.0,"One of my favorite purchases on amazon. The compression sleeves do exactly what they're supposed to do as described and keep my arms cool. I definitely feel more in control of the weight I'm lifting. They don't necessarily keep you from getting out of proper form, but they are a great assistant.

I'm ordering another set or two just to avoid washing over madness over again. I did wash them and they held up well. I was half afraid they would come undone somewhere in the stitching from a wash and dry, but when I took them out of the dryer, I was pleasantly surprised how well they held up. My confidence is at a high and I would recommend them to anybody that is in the gym, on the track, riding the bike or even flying on a plane.

I tend to get numbness in my arms when I'm sleeping or even as I type in bed while writing this review. My circulation with the compression sleeves on keeps everything in flow.

B01CHUZK96,5.0,"I am totally in love with this exercise mat.  It is super thick and kind of squishy, and I like that when I am doing yoga or stretches. The thickness is very good for aging knees as there is a little more cushion in the mat than most have.  It's so cushy that I can stand on it (no shoes!) and when I step off of it, the impressions of my feet remain for a couple of seconds, before the material evens back out.

The mat had an odor when I first opened it and it finally dissipated after a couple of hours.  The mat comes with a carrying strap that I still use even though I have a yoga bag.  I like to keep the mat rolled up and secure within the bag, but you could just use the carrying strap if you don't have a bag and it works fine.  The mat is easy to keep clean.  I use a mixture of distilled water mixed with a little vinegar and orange essential oil (a couple of drops) and spray my mat after using, and wipe it down.  Although I bought this at a reduced rated, I have reviewed it honestly and without bias.  This mat is high quality and non slip.",Nice!,False,
B01CHUZK96,5.0,"Firstly this yoga mat is thick, much thicker than a standard mat in case you've never seen a 10mm mat before. I personally do not like this kind of mat for balancing as it is too thick and can make things much harder, however this mat is top notch for any type of low impact floor exercises as it gives way more cushioning. Sit Ups are incredibly comfortable with so much thickness!.

One flaw i had is that my product arrived damaged, part of the mat is cut/torn. I am not sure if this will affect the longevity of the product or will be an indication of the quality of the product. However the seller did work very hard to rectify the situation and was probably the fastest seller i have ever worked with for replies, definitely top notch and reputable.

Unsure of overall quality and durability, but seems to be equally as good as mats you'd find at a much higher price point, but i have never used those either so i might be missing something. Overall minus the damage to the mat, i still recommend it if you are looking for a thick mat for floor exercises. I did get this discounted for my review, but it was not free",I personally do not like this kind of mat for balancing as it is ...,False,3

B01CHUZK96,4.0,"This mat is just the right size both height and width for me.  I use it during ab training and cool downs for some classes I take, and not yet for yoga.  I can see how the squishy-ness might make it difficult to hold a yoga pose, but for the class I take sometimes, they use two mats.  I can just use this as the second.  I like the thickness because otherwise there is not enough cushion when I have to be on elbows and knees.  It no longer feels like I'm actually just laying on the floor and the mat is simply a barrier between me and the dust and dirt of the floor.  This mat actually makes that part of working out much better.  I deducted a star because while I really do like it, I have noticed that it has indents and conforms easily to whatever it is laying against (or even the pattern in that carry handle thing), and I feel like it will probably get nicks and cuts easily.  Not sure there's a way around that, but it probably shouldn't have come with a few already there.",Nice barrier between my joints and hard parts and the floor,True,
B01CHUZK96,5.0,"I purchased this several months ago and have withheld a review, wanting to truly give this product a good test run. Simply put- it is AWESOME.
I have carpal tunnel in both wrists, which make plank, chaturanga and downward dog quite challenging and uncomfortable. The padding on this particular mat absorbs much of the shock that would normally be on my wrists, without the added cost and pain of wrist guards or other products. The mat is definitely ""stinky"" the first few times you use it (""manufactury"" smelling) but it dissipates quickly.
Highly recommend!",Ahhhhhh! Love this mat!,True,4
B01DIM68W0,5.0,"So I've been searching around for a segmented bait casting rod since I travel and want something easy to pack.  I was looking for a rod which was not only segmented but was light, durable and looked stylish.  With this product your really get your money's worth!  You get three different action rod tips, medium light (ML), medium (M) and medium heavy (MH).  I used all 3 and you can really feel the different in action across the 3.  It's like getting 3 rods in 1.

When I first got the rod, I saw the medium rod tip was snapped in half.  Obviously I was disappointed, but decided to contact the seller and they went above and beyond which one of the main reasons I'm giving this product 5 stars.  They were very responsive to my mails, treated me with respect and really made sure I was satisfied as their customer.  They replaced my whole rod though I was really only looking for a replacement tip.

I received this product over a month ago and since have taken it out over a dozen trips between fresh and salt water locations.  Thus far it has performed very well and caught me several large mouth bass, spotted bass and bluegill.  With the light tip you can feel every little bite, great for light line and tackle situations. With the heavy tip you can throw out some decent size bait.  I have used up to 1oz thus far and even with the backlashes, this rod is still able manage it just like those single piece, much more expensive rods.  I'm able to hold this rod for extended periods of time without getting fatigue since it is so light.

I would recommend getting this product especially at this price point.",Not just a great product but stellar customer service as well.,True,19.0

So great to have options. Not sure why more companies don't sell rods with different tips. Makes total sense. So you can adjust for the conditions and baits you are going to throw on a particular day. If you are finesse fishing with plastics you can use the medium-light, if you are throwing heavier swimbaits or flipping in heavy cover you can use the medium-heavy. I really like having one rod that has so many options.

I prefer this slide lock lids because you can close it to keep bugs out and if you knock your drink over it does not spill out.
If you turn your drink upside down this lid will hold the fluid in but it does Dribble just a little bit out of the slide lock but it is better than pouring out.
This lid fit on my cup perfect and sealed really well. The lid is clear so you can see your drink through the lid which is nice. The plastic is nice and thick and should hold up well.

It works great for when I fly and fits into my backpack side pocket perfectly. I wish that it came with a straw top, but I was able to buy one that fit it perfectly. I have a water bottle problem. A bit of an addiction. So I have at least 15 stainless steel vacuum insulated bottles and Hydro Flask stands up to the test of time far better than bottles half their price.

B01H8F04RS,5.0,"This saw is a great way to burn calories and get some fire wood at the same time. It does require more work then a bow saw but on the up side you can carry it in your pocket. The real trick is to apply enough pressure as to get a cut and not to much that is will bind into the wood. The large grips make the saw much more comfortable then the pocket saws with just rings, and it cuts much faster. You do have to figure out how to hold the wood because you need both hands on the saw and the saw can make the log roll. Still I like that it fits in my pocket and works well.

Being able to clear larger ones for my fellow riders is awesome, and since this tool is light enough to be negligible weight in my pack I'm happy to carry it. I'm also and offroader and I'll certainly be throwing it in the back of the truck just in case, could be the difference between the trail ending or getting on through.

B01H8F04RS,5.0,"I got this portable, folding pocket chain saw for 2 reasons:

1. To store in my Zombie Apocalypse kit.  Being prepared is always a good idea.

2. To assist me in cutting down branches and tree around my property.  There are several bushes along my fence line, and when it comes time to pruning them, it gets to be a bit cumbersome to fit a hand saw in some of these places.  When I saw this saw, I thought it should be the perfect compromise to get at these precariously places branches I want gone, and since hubby won't let me touch power tools other than an electric blower (I'm very accident prone), I thought this would be a great alternative to a power chain saw.

It came all rolled up very nicely, and very easy to store that way. Uncurling the saw, I was very surprised on how sharp the teeth were on this.  I have no need to prune for a few months so I'll have to get back to on how easy to use it was.",Stores compactly - very sharp,True,17

The handles are made that you have a good grip on them with a cutting area of 21 inches. the cutting teeth on the saw its self is sharp and has no problem cutting though wood. They clean out very well while cutting with no problem of clogging them selves with wood which would slow down the cutting process. The only thing that I did not like when I got the saw was that there was no information on taking care of the saw itself as what oil to use to clean it and on sharping the teeth when once dulled. The cordage that connects the handle to the saw seams a little weak. I would suggest a stronger type off matteral to connect the handles. Wiith the couple things that I would change on the item I still like it it is a great peace of kit and do enjoy it and think that it is a grat addition to any bug out bag, camping bag or take out when you go fourwheeling, and out door activity that you may find yourself in need a saw that is light weight and very compact.",Happycammping saw review.,True,2

B01H8F04RS,5.0,"I really like having this fold-able pocket saw. I am a scout leader, and go camping all the time with the boys. I try to find new things for the boys and try to get them involved with collecting wood, building fires and trying to practice their wildlife survival skills. I have a couple different things similar to this. I however like this one a lot better then the other ones I have. It works very well, and is fun to be a little more hands on when cutting the wood. This is a pretty strong chain, and the teeth on the chain seem to hold up well while using it. I also love how small this saw is and how easy it is to pack. I also love the handles on this saw. it makes it really easy to grip the saw while cutting the wood. I am looking forward to taking this pocket saw out camping with us on the next scout camp. You definitely get a good work out while using this saw and it is a very good feeling when you get through a good sized piece of wood. I am also excited to drain some of the energy the boys have.

B01H8F04RS,5.0,"So, my wife and son love to go camping and I have been tagging along with them for the past 2 years. I have to admit, I can certainly see the appeal of it and have had quite a good time with them. Of course, for me, it was more about spending time with my family that the actual camping trip itself. I took my son about a year ago to a mountain man class at our church and he loved it. In fact, I believe he took more away from the classes than I did. He certainly learned more than I did when it came to starting camp fires and keeping them going. In fact, he loves to use his hatchet to chop down small trees when we are camping to use for fire wood in the camp fires. So, when I saw this manual pocket saw, I thought for sure he would enjoy using this in addition to his hatchet. As a parent, I thought it would probably be a good idea to try this out before giving it to him to make sure that he would be able to use it by himself. I took this out behind our house before he got home and was able to cut down a small tree in a shorter amount of time than it normally took him to chop it down with the hatchet. But one thing that the product description doesnt tell you is that you will give yourself quite a workout using this chain, going back and forth until it is all cut down. But, regardless, this product really does work and it works well. I did not take another picture of the item after I used it because I was not going to bring it back inside with all the wood debris on it and I had forgot to take my phone/camera outside with me.
Disclaimer: I received this product for a discount in exchange for a fair and honest review. This however has not influenced my opinion.

B000HT980C,5.0,"Very solid feeling and nice looking club. My review is here hopefully to help with age and sizing.

I purchased this for my son on his second birthday.  At his 2 year physical he is average height and weight.  This club is a little long and a little heavy for him.  He can swing it and make contact some of the time but he has a club that is shorter and a light lighter (a homemade job) that he can use much more consistently to make contact with the ball.

In my opinion, unless your two year old is tall and stronger than average, I would place the age range at 2.5 - 5 years old.  Why 2.5, because a month has passed since his birthday and he is getting better with it, and I think by early spring, when he is 2.5 he will grow into the club more.

I hope this review helps anyone wondering about the age range for this club.","Nice club, a little big and heavy or my 2 year old son",True,3

I can't believe how clear and vivid it is underwater with these!!  Even clearer than just using my eyes! Everything is magnified and clear, and it actually works without majorly fogging up or letting in water.  I can't rant and rave enough about the mask itself... with a wide, clear view that is almost magnified looking.

As far as the breathing tube... it's good, but not perfect. I found it did cause my mask to move up a little and eventually let in a little water.

B000UMNTZQ,4.0,"Opinel knives are classics for a good reason.  They are well made, and they work.  I have had several in carbon steel and they came shaving sharp but this stainless blade had a small problem.  The edge was ever so slightly rolled over and this kept the blade from being as sharp as the carbon steel blades I was familiar with.  This is not a big problem and it can be remedied by 10 minutes of stropping on a leather strop.  My two stainless Opies are now shaving sharp and will probably stay that way with only an occasional session on the strop.  Stropping is a skill you should know and there are plenty of vids on YouTube to show you how to make a strop and how to use it.  While I would like to have received my knives in fully sharpened condition, fixing the problem is certainly no show stopper.

There is a gap between the blade and the finger guard on both sides just waiting for meat to get in there and go rancid and spread germs if you don't clean it well . The blade has machine marks from end to handle . But unlike others claim mine didn't come razor sharp . It didn't take much to get it that way though . The handle material is some kind of gripy hough type rubber compound . This is in my opinion the best part of this knife . The grip of the handle really gives you control . I will go as far to say the handle is awsome !  I cleaned a deer with the knife and when done the blade felt as sharp as it was b4 i started . Dont get me wrong i like this knife . I just feel like this knife deserved a cleaner looking blade and a metal finger guard even if it added more to the price . One review said he was switching from mora to this knife lol i can buy 2 moras for the price of this knife . This knife is worth the $22 + i gave for it .

B0026D0OKU,4.0,"Like others have said, this works perfectly. I have a small S Works Roubaix. With Di2 battery... cage placement doesn't accommodate a decent size Bidon (much less my larger botte).  This solves the problem allowing me to move the cage DOWN (directions say it is to move up... just install it upside down).  I also agree with the beef on crummy components. This is my second unit. The first fell apart after 3 years/18,000 miles.","solves problems, wimpy components",True,
B0026D0OKU,4.0,"My new frame came with a raised seatpost bottle mount to accommodate Di2.  This put the bottle super close to the top tube, especially with my larger bottles.

B004DJCL7Y,5.0,"It's paracord...so why is it worthy of a review?  Well, simply because there are bizillions of paracord products out there.  Here is what you need to know:

Pros:
- This stuff is rated for 550 lbs.  I haven't actually put it to that extreme test but I've had 400 lbs held with ease by a single line of this stuff and it didn't appear to be straining a bit.
- Great price so it is easy to stock up on a bunch of this stuff.  You should always have some in your garage, emergency kit, hiking pack, and in your cars.  Don't forget your cars!!
- SO MANY COLORS!  Too many actually...it takes too long to figure out which one you want sometimes.

Cons:
- None so far with the product.  It is sometimes difficult however to wade through all the options to find one at the lowest price on the scale.

B00GGC3454,4.0,"I would have given this a 5 Star but it seems like the item I received is not the same brand as the picture shows or what the vendor says.

I was lucky to have this ship to me through PRIME for $17 (now $13) and got it within 2 business days. So far I have rode in the rain, left my bike outside through weather and have only single charge this once from when I received (38 days). For the most part I have the light (blinking mode no laser) on 5 days a week for less then hour and I still haven't charge it. I must admit that the laser is pretty cool but really serves no purpose but battery drain, also the mount is too wide to fit on my seat pole, I had to make my seat pole wider by adding cardboard and electrical tape for the grip, then using the rubber for a tight fit.

Pros: Long battery life, rechargeable, build quality

Cons:Recharges with single prong entry instead of mini\micro USB, Can't adjust too much the vertical light angle, mount to wide for bicycle seat

B00H35ZY2Y,4.0,"First, I received the yak right after Thanksgiving (cold and wet winter ever since), and although it arrived in one piece, there were several deep scuff marks and minor dents on it.  This was because it's shipped in a big plastic bag, which really doesn't protect it from abuse by freight handlers, and had large holes torn in it.  Second, Dolphin does not include any documentation with the kayak - like do's and don'ts and what's included.  Their owner's manual, which must be acquired online, is not very informative.  Being a rookie yakker, I wasn't sure what four large foam blocks (that were found just laying around in the yak's bottom) were for.  Emailing Dolphin resulted in a cryptic reply they're for ""form and buoyancy.""  I still can't figure out how the ""nose piece"" will get past the foot pedals as it's waaaay too big.  All-in-all, I can't wait for fair weather so I can test drive my yak.

B00LW8EH8K,5.0,"These are a must-have if you have a Rockshox fork that supports it!

I have a Reba RL Solo Air that came stock on my Spec' Epic Comp. The Reba works fine but it was super finicky to dial in. Even after riding it for a year, if I set the air pressure to 20% then it's too easy to bottom out with a harsh ""clunk"".

Installation is super easy - just let all the air out and use a 24mm sock to remove the top cap. Then, simply drop in however many bottomless tokens you need (this unit comes with a new top cap that has the corresponding thread for the tokens) and tighten with the 24mm socket.

I put in 2 tokens and run the sag at 20%. I also speed up the rebound and open up the compression. The fork is now smooooth with all the small bump compliance but it only bottoms out once or twice on the largest drops! The Reba RL has pretty basic compression dampers, but now it rides with a bit more platform than before!

B00MYABSVE,5.0,"There's not much I can fault this knife for. At under $30 it has decent steel and good quality. After a day of yard work doing some landscaping and cleaning (trimming plants, cutting apart twine and cardboard boxes, etc.) it retained a decent edge. I didn't need to resharpen it afterwards.  Blade shape is good for typical yard chores. The blade height and thickness works well for trimming roots when transplanting (it's not technically the *right* tool for it, but the trowel was on other side of the house). It made quick work of cutting pine stakes.

Only issues I had was the grip and the sheath. Though it's solidly built, the shape does not fit my hand and it became uncomfortable to use. I didn't take a star off for this because others may find it perfect. The sheath is difficult to buckle when strapped to my belt.

B00NUFB7HW,5.0,At first I thought they sent me the wrong wrap because it was too long and didn't appear to fit my g32. After watching some online videos I realized it needs to be trimmed rather easily with a sharp knife after install. Looks and feels great.,Fix's Glocks only flaw from the factory making the grip extremely comfortable!,True,
B00NUFB7HW,5.0,"I've carried and shot Glocks for almost 20 years, in every available caliber, and they are fantastic utility firearms. My only real complaint about ALL Glocks is that even with the factory waffling, once your hands start to sweat, a solid grip is all but impossible to maintain.

As a result, I've tried almost every available supplemental grip -- Hogue, skateboard tape, even custom stippling. Well, for those of you in the same boat, look no more. Brooks Agrip really is da bomb.

The Agrip is not abrasive, so your gun doesn't chew up clothes or furniture when it is holstered. It has a velvety texture and is not afraid of sweat, dirt or oil. After several months of daily carry and almost a thousand rounds thru the gun, the Agrip still looks as good as new. And most importantly, there is grip - and more grip - for days. As an added bonus, slight adjustments - once your grip is obtained - are really easy and less dramatic than with other grip solutions.

Installation was straightforward really shouldn't require any trimming for stock applications. I installed this after fitting a magwell, which called for a little minor trimming. No biggie ... just use a sharp razorblade and go slowly. Don't press too lightly and definitely don't press too hard.

All my Glocks are now being fitted with Agrips ...","You scream, I scream, we all scream ... for Agrip.",True,

B01561ZVXS,4.0,"We got this for a Scout's recent summer outing.  The campground featured cots in canvas tents on concrete slabs.  This was a ""drive-in"" affair.

Temperatures at night were in the low 60s, briefly dipping to high 50s occasionally.  Under these conditions, he felt it was just right.  He was comfortably warm.

Though I felt the material to be a bit coaeaw, especially compared to our name-brand mummy bags, he said it was no problem at alll, perhaps because he slept in his clothes as some youth will do.  It does feature a fabric strip that prevents the zipper from snagging the inner lining, so that's a nice touch.

The main detracting was that the bag is not terribly light at 3.3lbs, and it is virtually incompressihle. Though the included sack includes compression straps, the bag is fairly dense and the material is not so fine, so it remains rather large even under compression.

In summary this is a decent low cost bag for light outings such as indoor slumber parties, car camping or drive-in tenting in mild spring, summer or very early fall weather. It wouldn't be suitable for hiking trips, and definitely not for cooler temperatures.  But for what it is, we are satisfied with the purchase.",Scout approved for light-duty use,True,

B01ACHGGQW,4.0,Very good light.,Four Stars,True,
B01ACHGGQW,5.0,"I love NiteRider lights, but the built in battery doesn't last more than a couple years.  Really hope that I can replace the battery on this and it will last a long time.  I can keep an extra battery charged up in my bag for longer, colder rides, or for when I forget to charge the light.  Battery life on lithium batteries is never as long as advertised when it below 40 degrees out.

Good build quality on the light.  Attachment is ok, but not great.  It needs repositioned on bumpy rides.  Beam pattern is great, with good cut off, and light patch right at the wheel as well as good throw.  On the high setting, it has enough light to go 25 mph on familiar roads without outrunning it.  The day time blink is perfect for dusk/dawn riding.",I love NiteRider lights,True,
B01ACHGGQW,4.0,"Fenix makes quality products for the most part but the engineer who had the idea to glue a plastic disk to the positive battery terminal, deep inside the light, should be immediately shot and killed.  It is a huge PIA to remove.  Be careful because there is a partially exposed circuit board just behind the positive terminal and you can permanently damage the light with anything pointy and metal (probably the first thing you'd reach for unless you want to get your finger stuck in there).  The flashlight itself is exactly the product I would expect from Fenix, but man, what a horrible user experience right out of the box.  You could A) cover the negative terminal instead, B) ship the battery outside the light, or C) not glue the disk and rely on the spring tension to hold it in place during shipment.",What were they thinking???,True,4
B01B06CKLY,5.0,"This is exactly what I was looking for. My family travels a lot because all of our families are out-of-state and I was looking for a travel cup to hold our electric toothbrushes (nothing fancy, just the oral b crossaction ones from the supermarket). I had issues finding a travel-friendly cup that was sturdy enough to handle the weight of these brushes since I hate leaving brushes on the counter and also dislike running around hotel rooms looking for glasses. I decided to try this mug and it is perfect. The larger base makes this mug very stable, so it can handle multiple electric toothbrushes. The silicone is thick where it should be and thin where it should be, so it is very easy to extend and collapse. The silicone is on the thicker side, so it is just really stable and solidly made. Really perfect for my uses",Can hold up several electric toothbrushes!,True,

B01B2PC8J2,4.0,"Updated -
I was contacted by the supplier about my disappointment with the product. They offered me a replacement item and I accepted it with the hopes that this new one would be functioning. I was happy to see that when the item arrived and when I checked it against compasses that work properly, that it did in fact point north and all other aspects of it were still in the condition that I expected when I placed the first order. I have since increased the original rating up from 2 stars to 4 stars as a result of the working product and the service that this company provided when the initial item was not in working order.

Looks good when it showed up, but the compass does not point north. I have made sure that there is no electrical or magnetic interference but it doesn't do what it should. The magnifier and the scale on the side still come in handy, but you would have to use a different compass in order to be able to do any real orienteering with this item",Works Properly,True,3

B000096QJQ,5.0,"I gave this puzzle to my daughters (age 1.5 and 3.5) for Christmas.  Practically the first day, the stickers started to peel here and there.  It wasn't terrible, but it's obvious that over time this isn't going to hold up.
I'm terribly disappointed because I wanted such a neat puzzle to last for the grandchildren.  This puzzle is advertised as a wooden puzzle, which implies quality construction.  It may be made of wood under the stickers, but that doesn't mean it's going to last.
After purchasing the Cutting Food Box by Melissa & Doug, (which is a fabulous, durable, awesome toy) I foolishly assumed that this would be of the same great quality, probably with a painted-on finish.  Or at least a layer of lamination over the stupid stickers to protect them!!!
Well, it's just typical cheap ""made in China"" junk.
I called the company to complain.  The first lady I spoke to assured me that this was absolutely not supposed to happen, it must be that I just got a bad one.  She told me she'd send me a new one right away.
Here I am, over a month later, no new puzzle has arrived.  So I called again and spoke to a gentlemen who wasn't so helpful.  Apparantly, they just entered my information today, so my puzzle should ship tomorrow.  I can't believe it's taking them so long to ship me a new one.  But I guess, since they've already taken my money I'm not a priority anymore.
To top it off, my replacement puzzle will be of the same construction, no improvements.  I don't really even want it anymore, but the customer service guy ""didn't know what else to tell me.""
Well the bottom line is, don't waste your money on this one, at least not if you're expecting something long-lasting.","Great design, poor finish quality",True,61

I don't think he's as into animals as much as cars and trucks, but there are only so many choices.  I found that his other puzzle was good because it had the frame to stay in and he would put it away on his shelf.  He would begin his puzzle making by putting all of the colored edges out on the table.  Of course that wasn't all of the pieces.  He still had to find the middle pieces, but the fact that they had predominating colors in each puzzle allowed him to find those.  He just did it last.  Those outlined edges helped in putting the puzzle together as well.  He loves the sense of accomplishment when he's finished one.

B000096QJQ,4.0,"Beautiful 6-in-1 puzzle, made of wood.  You can assemble each puzzle picture in the solid wooden platform, which helps.

Unfortunately, the puzzles are complicated.  You have six puzzles mixed together here, so little ones easily frustrated should not indulge in this puzzle madness.  Even adults get confused.  The other thoughtless thing M&D did here was neglect to include a picture of each puzzle on a card or in a booklet, so you can build each picture with a reference.  Now, a small sticker on the platform shows each picture, but how is that helpful if the platform is supposed to be your puzzle base?  LOL.  Pretty dumb.

The only saving grace here is that the individual puzzles' borders are colored, so you can at least start with most of the pieces turned right-side up.  :)

Overall, this multi-puzzle is well-made, colorful, and entertaining for stubborn minds.  Not simple and easy.  Make sure your kids are old enough to handle some frustration/confusion.",Complicated But Well-Made,True,

For one thing, my charming granddaughter got way too many presents! I suggested that my daughter put most of them away and take them out one at a time.
I tried putting this together - without granddaughter - and could see that it probably is above her ability right now. Don't even attempt it before age 3, I think (which is probably on the label!)

She isn't exactly ready to do them by herself, but with help from an adult she can do half of it by herself. We were happy how excited she was that she could dump the blocks off the board and start over on a new animal when she got frustrated with the one she was on and look at the pictures to immediately decide which animal to do next. Also, we love that when she is sick of doing the puzzles she can just stack the blocks on the board. LOVE the big block size too, because our nephew is only one and when he is right beside his sister playing he takes everything she has in front of her and with these blocks we don't have to worry about if the blocks get put in his mouth.",Love the multiple puzzles in one idea!!!,True,

Even though there are only 16 cubes, this puzzle is fairly difficult.  My daughter mastered 25-piece jigsaw puzzles before she was able to do this one.  It's much harder to do a puzzle when all of the pieces are square.

Like most Melissa & Doug puzzles, this one is well-made.  Our Farm Cube puzzle hasn't shown any wear.  However, it does have an odd smell (possibly adhesive?) that the other puzzles don't have.

She has stacked them up and knocked them down, she has roughly thrown them across the room, and in general beat them up.  Hers are in perfect condition.

It is a great puzzle to teach the basic concepts of solving puzzles - it is simple enough for young children to visualize and has a nice color-coded boarder that helps identify which sides are appropriate for each puzzle side. This step wise approach to problem solving is a great tool for life. Also there is a great selection of puzzles with the six sides of the cubes, providing enough variation that a child could play for this much longer than with a similar, single-sided puzzle. The puzzle is also great for younger kids as a building block set. In terms of durability, it has held up fine over the past year.

This is one of the best toys we have ever bought.  They are too young to do it themselves but love to decide which animal to do and them we look for pieces and they help me put it together.

I wonder if there was a defective parcel out there.",mine was well made,False,
B000096QJQ,4.0,"I gave this puzzle a high rating only because of its immense learning value. The quality of the puzzle is diminished because the stickers on each side of the puzzle can easily peel off [its just paper and not painted on], so one has to be very careful in handling the puzzle blocks. On the other hand, the educational value of this puzzle set is very high - young ones can spend quality fun time trying to figure out how to put an animal 'together' [there are six animals in all - pig, chicken, sheep, cow, horse, and duck]. Each puzzle block has six sides and children can learn to manipulate them to put an animal together. A set of pictures on the back of the puzzle box provides a visual cue as to how to piece each animal together.

The puzzle requires quite a bit of higher-order thinking skills and I would recommend this to preschoolers and up.","A great puzzle for stimulating thinking, but poor quality!",False,
B000096QJQ,4.0,"We bought this puzzle for our 3 year old, who has recently shown an interest in puzzles.  We chose this puzzle because of the unique shape and the fact that she can create 6 different farm scenes with the peices.  The fact that each side of the block is a part of a different picture makes this puzzle challenging. Although it has only 12 peices, this is a good choice for a child with some jigsaw puzzle experience.  Not only must our daughter assemble the puzzle, without the interlocking jigsaws to help (since it is a cube, each side is straight), she must also flip each peice around and figure out which side belongs to the picture she is trying to create.

Because this puzzle is challenging for a preschooler, I am rating it 4 stars.  I would have given it a higher rating, except that the finish is chipping.  It does not hold up as well as the other Melissa and Dough puzzles that we have.  Nonetheless, it is a great addition for a pre-schoolers growing puzzle collection.",Great concept - finish quality could be better,False,

Don't be fooled by the colors on the maze. This is a solid product and is exceptional in every way. I haven't tried it while driving in the car, but I will see if it's good for long rides as well while in the carseat.

The tools are actually make of hard rubber, and appear to be very well made.  My girls played with their tools for at least an hour without incident while I was getting dinner ready, and for that, it was well worth the purchase price!  This is a good first tool set for younger children with smaller hands.  My girls loved the tin box the tools all came in and took great care to return everything back into the box.

B000PC51LQ,5.0,These bath toys have something you wouldn't normally think of as wonderful till after you've owned enough to see that bath toys accumulate MILDEW! these do NOT which makes them last forever. I used to throw away bath toy after bath toy because of mildew getting stuck inside the toy or in small cracks. these do not have a hole that lets in water that cannot get out. my son has really enjoyed these and lines them up and matches the shapes. really wonderful toy that can LAST!,BEST bath toy ive encountered!,True,16
B000PC51LQ,5.0,"I am really excited for this toy.  I bought it during the ""toy of the day sale"" but it looks so much better in person.  I thought it was a simple bath toy but now realize it has linking abilities, shape sorters, and mildew resistant coating.  The toys all float well and they look extremely well made.  Not to mention the great packaging that drew my daughter to it as soon as it came out of the shipping box!  My daughter absolutely loves them already!!!  I have to admit when I bought them I did not pay too much attention to them due to the wonderful sale that Amazon had, but now I am extremely happy with my purchase!!

Update 2009-  We still have these in our bathtub and unlike many other bath toys these are still around.  Both my kids love to hook them together (a little difficult as the water does separate them often).  My kids learned both colors and shapes from these toys and they have not had any mildew or anything.  I am extremely happy with this purchase :)

Dec 29 2012- We did finally get rid of these bath toys.  I will say they had to be the longest lasting bath toys we have ever had and probably ever will have as my kids are now 5 and 6 (almost 7).  Regardless after about 4 years they did start to show signs of mold even though they are mold resistant.  More then likely one of them got a hole in it or something but these bath toys are worth their weight in gold with how long they lasted.  When I bought these my daughter could barely talk and my youngest was too little to be in the bathtub.  These boats helped teach my kids colors, shapes and basic concepts of fitting the shapes in the hole.  There are only a few purchases I can remember years later and this was one of them!",Looks much better in person!!!  updated 2 years and 5 years later,True,63

These boats teach in two ways - the child has to not only match up the color of the sails with the color of the boats, but the shapes as well.  The bottom of the sails are shapes that only fit in the boat with the same shape inside.

I think the top ""sail"" parts are a little too hard for the bath and if my son were to sit down on one after the water has drained from the tub and it was pointed up it would really hurt him. Also, the second time we were bagging them up after the bath I noticed one of the boats was full of water. The boats all have seals on the bottom of them to prevent them from filling with water, but the seal already came loose.

My only wish is that the boats would stay hooked together a little better because unless the bath water is perfectly still, they don't stay together very well (and we all know the bath water is NEVER perfectly still with a little one!).  But that's not a big deal because it's more about the shapes, colors and puzzle aspect.  Would recommend!",Good purchase!,True,
B000PC51LQ,5.0,Got these for our  17 month old Daughter as a stocking stuffer for Christmas. It was the only thing she wanted to play with all day. The material is great. Its soft and easy to handle for her. The different colors and shapes grabs her attention as well as linking the boats together. The boats don't hold any water as well so that erases that concern. Great toy.,Great buy,True,

B000PC51LQ,4.0,My son loves these boats. The only complaint he has is that they don't link together well- they come apart easily,Overall a good toy,True,
B000PC51LQ,5.0,my son loves these bath toys they not only teach colors but they teach shapes the sails come off and each sail has a different shape on the bottom of it so it will only fit the boat of the same color a great bath toy for a great price it also comes with its own storage bag which lets any water it might collect in the bath tub to leave when place inside the bag (the bag is made of mesh) a great durable toy for a great price,great bath toys,True,
B000PC51LQ,5.0,"These were purchased for use at my grandson's water table.  He needed some extra items to use when playing in the water with the table.  These are very nicely made, they function as puzzles because the sails only fit in the correct boat bottom, and it is a clever review of shapes because the base of each sail is a particular shape. I like that they are a flexible plastic instead of the hard, brittle type.  They are appropriately small for busy little hands, too.",Purchased for use at water table,True,
B000PC51LQ,5.0,"This toy is marketed as a bath toy, but has so many other uses. As a pediatric speech therapist I use these all the time with the kiddo I work with. It has also become one of my go to gifts. They are great for working on colors, shapes, counting, fine motor skills and so much more. In the bath they are great because there is no whole so water can't get in and cause mold to grow inside the toys.",A must have....,True,2
B000PC51LQ,5.0,"Right out of the box, my 2yr old daughter was captivated. All she wanted to do was fit the flag pieces into the boat's shaped slots. She loves them. Also, they float great in the tub. No complaints.",My daughter loves it!,True,
B000PC51LQ,4.0,"My son is in love with shapes and was more interested in that than the fact they floated.  So for that, its a five star toy.  What makes it a four is that for what it is.-- the price is a but much.

Also I do like that it is supposed to be mold resistant and has no place for water to enter either piece (sail is separate from boat).  I personally can't stand seeing the gross stuff that grows on any water toy!",Decent water toy,True,
B000PC51LQ,4.0,"So far, these seem to fit the bill.  They were purchased for a very young child (7 months) and I could see where the hard plastic sails will be better for an older child, but so far she's enjoying them just fine!",little boats,True,
B000PC51LQ,5.0,"These little boats were bought for a water table but we use them in the tub as well. They help with learning colors, color matching (since the sails detach from the boats) and shapes. Lot of lessons in these litle boats.",Love these little boats,True,
B000PC51LQ,5.0,All the kids fight over these we had to purchase a few more for backups.  Love the colors so vibrant and the shapes are perfect fit.  WE have given away as gifts and get rave reviews.  Perfect for the OCEAN BEACH person as well.,All the kids LOVE them.....,True,
B000PC51LQ,5.0,"I came across these while ordering replacements for the bath toys our twins play with.  I wanted something different than the foam letters/numbers and water squirters they normally get and had never seen these boats or this brand before.  These boats are awesome!

Our twins (27 months) are working on colors, counting and shapes and these cover all of that!  They can match by color or shape, we can hook boats together and ask them to count them and they can chew on the boats while they work on those two year molars.  They don't seem to trap water inside either, which is a huge plus since as most parents know, no matter how much you clean some bath toys, water gets trapped, mildew grows and you're tossing toys.  I couldn't be more pleased with these and have several more from this brand saved to order in the future.",Excellent educational bath toy!,True,

B000PC51LQ,5.0,"My kids, 5 and 3 years old, love the boats. They especially love connecting them together and making a ""train"" on the edge of the bathtub. It took a lot of convincing to keep the boats in the tub as I did not want them to get dirty on the floor. It took even more convincing to stop my 3-year-old from taking them straight out of the bath to bed to sleep with.  My 5-year-old loves putting the boats in a certain order by colors and shapes. I thought she may be too old for them but she enjoys them as much as my 3-year-old.",Fun bath toy,True,2

It was easy to assemble and is very light and easy to move around. Our kiddo doesn't rock very hard, and has not been able to tip himself over yet. Be aware that kids can slip off the rear-end over the tail if they're not paying attention to where their butt is. We also have ours on carpet, as the noises from rocking were pretty annoying on hard wood, so I would recommend this for carpeted rooms or with a rug.

He is developmentally disabled and a little shorter and lighter for his age (30lbs) but it works well, his feet are about 6 inches off the ground.

He knows how to rock it first time he got on it (see video). Seems sturdy and stable. Baby is average size for his age. I don't like the leprous look of the horse, but the price is so good that I can't complain. There are other styles that are even cheaper, though.

The only thing bad I can think to say about this bang for your buck is that if your kiddo rocks hard the horse will move forward.

You have to assemble it by screwing on the rocker frame to the bottom. Not a big deal, but I had to get my husband to help because I could push down on the rocker hard enough to access the screw and get it started. Once put together it seemed sturdy.

B000VLXDAC,5.0,"This is one of the coolest toys we've ever bought for our son.  We've had it for about 3 years now, and I purchased it after our kiddo, who generally shows very little interest in toys, rode a rocking lion at a birthday party her sister was at and got giddy happy about it.  So at the time, elephants were his favorite thing, yes, I know it's a wooly mammoth, but it looks like an elephant to him and it matched the color of an elephant he responded to in one of his books, so I thought he'd think it was even better.

He totally didn't...it took him about 8 months to even touch it, and in the beginning, because he had a hard time with toys that made sounds, the noise this made freaked him out (so that's a cautionary note to any parent with kiddos with sound sensitivity).  But then he slowly started using it, and then he seemed to just fall in love...yippee for me, because he totally doesn't love a lot of toys and this one is great for helping regulate some of his sensory issues.

I think it's something that probably appeals to a wide range and age of kiddos, because I'm constantly having to pull my daughter and her friends off this thing, because they're above the weight limit.  And my son himself is now above it, and will still use it, so we're planning on going with that until it breaks, which it miraculously hasn't yet.

I will say that sometimes the handles loosen up, because they screw on and off by hand, but they are easily tightened down, and it doesn't really present a problem from our perspective.","Very Cool, Sturdy, Durable Rocking Toy",True,

B000VLXDAC,5.0,"After a bad experience with the panda rocker, we ordered the giraffe.  We're really pleased.

The problem with the panda was a misshapen face (it was otherwise just fine).  We did not have that problem with this one.  It's really adorable and well-constructed.  I'm looking forward to giving it to my niece for Christmas.

She's 21 months, and I feel confident that it will be a good size for her.  The giraffe is a little smaller than the panda, though it would be hard to tell from the photos and listing information.  Both have a weight limit of 80lb and are recommended for children ages 2 and up.  But I'd say the giraffe's seat is slightly lower and the animal, itself, is a bit smaller looking.  As indicated on the listings, the giraffe weighs a bit less.

As with the panda, this arrived in a brown box with no shipping box or packing material around it.  And it amazes me, but the contents were again just fine.  Since it's a plain box, I plan to give this to her already constructed.  We did assemble it already, as a test, and again I found assembly very easy.  For anyone having issues lining up the legs with the rocker holes, you simply need to realize that the legs do swing a bit to adjust.

I would purchase this again for another child.",just right,True,2

B000VLXDAC,5.0,"Haley the rocking horse is very cute.  I gave it as a baby shower gift for a couple that doesn't know if their baby is a boy or a girl and with a western themed baby shower.  It received many oohs and ahhs. Our Haley's saddle stirrups are uneven, but still very cute.  I hope they wouldn't be dangerous for the little one. The saddle itself doesn't lie perfectly smooth, but probably just needs to be sat on a few times.  I think it might be better without the saddle, but it does give it a more western touch and it's not removable.  I pulled some of the mane and tail ""hair"" free from the seams and it was even better. The coat is short very soft plush that should be fairly easily spot cleaned. The ears were a little flat when I first unpacked the horse, but they were easily reshaped. The assembly was very easy.  My husband added little wooden plugs over the screws which he thought gave it a better finished look.  I ordered ""used"" from the warehouse and it was a new item with just minor damage to the inner box with the contents not damaged at all.  I cannot tell how durable the horse will be but it feels very sturdy and I would expect it to be up to lots of loving from this lovingly expected child for several years to come.

As others have mentioned about the neck being too short and their child flipping over it.... we have never had that problem the whole year of having this. We may have had an incident of her falling down when she was getting off, but she is a toddler and all toddlers are clumsy.

She jumped right on it like a cow girl and moved the head up and down and zoomed across the living room. She is two so she still is a bit small for it but with assistance from me, she rode it just fine. The convince of both the wooden handles and the leather one made it ten times more easier for her to handle. The only down fall about this product is there is no reverse.. you physically have to turn it. Which I am completely fine with. It does not scratch your polished hard wood floors either like other products like this does. Highly recommend this for children...

This isn't a cheaply made toy whatsoever. A lot of thought went into putting this together. From the mane/tail, to the saddle/reins, and the little foot boards. It's just all around well made. It's cushy enough that when my 10 month old is climbing on it and falls, he doesn't bust his face, but plenty sturdy enough to hold my almost 40 lb daughter.

B000VLXDAC,5.0,"I really researched a lot of rocking horses before choosing this Happy Trails Rocking Horse.  I am so glad that I did, because it is wonderful and my daughter loves it!  I bought it early in December for Christmas and I didn't even take it out of the box until Christmas Eve night.  The box itself seems a lot lighter than you would expect a rocking horse to be.  But when we did finally open it up, my husband and I were very pleased to see that you only have to install the horse onto the wood rocking platform.  One of the legs was a little tricky, and I think it's because we screwed the other 3 legs onto it pretty tight.  So when you are doing it, don't screw them in entirely until you have all 4 legs on.  The horse is really cute, the fur has soft feel and it is solid but whatever it is stuffed with doesn't make it really hard.  The horse has wood handles, a saddle with stirrups and wood rocking base.  My daughter is 2 years 7 months but is as tall as an average 4 year old and this guy is still a tiny bit tall for her.  She can get up on him now with some practice but still needs someone to stand next to her incase she goes tumbling onto the other side (it has almost happened 2 times now).  It only took her 2 times to figure out to rock herself.  She loves it and so will your little one!!","Love it, I am so glad I picked out this one!",True,4
B000VLXDAC,4.0,"Our three year old granddaughter had it in her head she wanted a rocking horse. She had seen one in Home Depot that made noise and moved it's ears and tail. But it was very low to the ground and she is a little tall. When we purchased this one I did read all the reviews but my bad.....didn't notice it didn't do anything. But 2 days before Christmas there was nothing we could do at this point. She opened it, and absolutely loves it. She didn't care or even ask if anything moved. IF you want it to do something there is another version of this same horse but it's also quite a bit more money. She is so happy with it and her parents say she doesn't want to get off of it. So we are very pleased. I felt this was very well made. Easy to put together. A big hit!!!!

B000VLXDAC,4.0,"I've seen these for awhile and wanted to get one for our youngest who is just under 1 year old. We sort of have a baby animal theme for him. I feel like this one closely resembles the Pier 1 rocking elephant and at a much better value. It arrived in a large box in 4 main pieces (elephant, wooden rocker, and two side handles) along with some screws and washers. I put it together myself and it wasn't too bad. The rocker part screws into the screws vertically on the elephant's feet. I had to sort of stretch the back legs apart in order to get it to go on because the alignment was a bit off. The handles went on easily. It took less than 10 minutes and would have been much quicker had the back legs been aligned properly. My biggest concern with this item is that there were 5 dark spots on it that were pretty dirty. I had to recheck my order because I know I purchased this item brand new and it seemed like someone else had returned it. Either way, I think the elephant rocker is super cute. I think it's a great size for our 10 month old and it holds enough weight that our 2 year old can probably safely enjoy it as well. We have it hidden and will put it out Christmas morning with a big red bow. I can't wait to see our son's reaction! If you're looking for something like this, be sure to see the selection they have available. They have soooo many animals to choose from and they are all really adorable!","So cute, easy to assemble, and great height for baby's first rocker",True,

B000VLXDAC,4.0,"The base came pre-assembled and in great condition (though cheap pine wood). All I had to do was put the screw pegs at the bottom of the hooves into the pre-made holes on the base, and put on the washers and tighten the bolts. Then I used my hands to screw on the handles.
It boasts having a weight limit of 80 lbs. I am around 110 lbs and I decided to test it out. It held my weight for the few seconds I sat on it, and the product did not bend or buckle. It shows no signs of being sat on by me.
The eyes are really off-center and one is deeper than the other. I actually started cracking up because the horse looks ridiculous. I played around with the fabric but didn't find an easy way to fix this. One of the nostrils was flat and the other was in (like a nostril hole should be), so I just played with the other one until it went in. It's not like kids are going to be staring at the face and judging the appearance, but it's something that could have been done better.
I would never, ever pay full price for this (as of this review, asking price is $125). I got it for $40. I'm satisfied with that price.
I saw some concerns about certain rockers not having sound. Lil Henry does not advertise having any sounds, as of the date I'm writing this review. The instructions do show how to place batteries, but that is because the instructions are not specific to the model you receive.

B000VLXDAC,4.0,"Bought this for Xmas and my 18 month old son was terrified of it, but over time got used to him and now he loves his horse.  I had a hard time trying to decide on this one or another that was taller, but I chose this one.  My son is in the 90th percentile for height and weight and I'm 5'10""  so we're not small people.  This horse was the perfect size.  My sons feet barely touched the wooden footholds and the horse, six months later, is still my son's size and he's still 90th percentile.  The only downside is the smell that it gives off and how loud the horse sings.  I simply aired out the horse in my storage room for a few weeks.  No doubt there are evil chemicals in this, but if I tired to eliminate all chemicals from our life I'd drive myself crazy and would have to quit my job.  As far as how loud the horse sings, there's no way to dampen it unless you wrap a ""scarf"" around the neck.  My decision: take the batteries out.  Can't give five stars because of the off gassing and high decibels on the voice box.  However, high marks because of the fun and affection my son has with and for his horse.",Happy Happy Trails,True,

I would have given the giraffe a 5-star review but since it's reportedly appropriate for a one-year old, I think there should be some type of strap to hold the child from slipping off.  Perhaps it really isn't made for a child that young (the age appropriate info may have come from reviews).  If the company somewhere indicates an age limit of 2 and up, I would give this product a full 5-stars for sure.  Also, the giraffe is very sturdy.

The sound effects are hysterical, and given the fact that she has been on this horse constantly, it is well built.  You can probably tell from the picture, but I'll mention it anyway: one can still get a finger or toe completely crushed under this thing, there is no safety mechanism for that at all.",3 yr old daughter's Christmas Gift,True,
B000VLXDAC,4.0,"I purchased this horse for my taller-than-average  3 year old daughter It has been a huge hit with her, and it looked adorable next to the tree Christmas morning.

The size is perfect for this age - she had to practice getting on and off a few times. It will allow her to easily grow a couple inches with it. We have NOT had any problems with it tipping while rocking, as others have mentioned.

The horse is very lightweight, easy to assemble, and visually pleasing. However, the materials do feel low quality. I don't expect the saddle and stirrups to last very long.

So far, I don't mind the sound effects, my daughter really likes the song, and it adds to the personality in my opinion. I feel $60 is a fair price for the quality. I don't expect this horse to become a family heirloom.

The base is just sanded pine without any varnish so it might be susceptible to liquids. It does not come with batteries and truth be told Im ok with it.

I did have to re-shape the legs a bit to line them up with the holes, but I think that was just from being packed in the box.  It's actually quite plush rather than just fur over plastic or wood and looks just like the photo.  The rockers and handles are wood although probably just pine.

When I put her on it to see how tall it was, it was taller than I expected.  I'll probably save it as a present for her next birthday because it's something that a child would have to be older for because it is tall and doesn't come with any straps or anything to hold the child on it and it looks like something they could easily fall off if they're not tall enough.

They don't stand out too much in the picture, but in person they do, and are really weird looking.

B000VLXDAC,4.0,"This was a Christmas gift for my 2-year-old. At this age she is not very interested in it (in fact she's kind of scared to be on it) but I know it will grow on her (my older kid didn't like rocking animals until age 4 or so). Her younger sister will sit on it (she's 1, so we hold onto her while she's on it) and she actually enjoys it for brief periods. We have 2 toddlers right now so I am sure this bear will be used a lot ... eventually.

What I am rating in this review is the bear itself, since my kids can't use it much yet.

The bear did arrive with a few scratches on the wood - there are some large screws on the feet of the animal that contacted the wood while in shipping. Basically, to assemble it you need to line up these screws on the feet with the wooden base and push them in, then secure the bottom. It did require 2 people to get the screws on the feet aligned with the base (the legs are pretty solid and have some resistance), but it only took about 5 minutes. The trick is to do it without scratching the wooden base, since it is pretty soft wood.

The handles are screwed into the head, although one does keep coming loose like another reviewer stated. That and the lopsided head are the reason I gave this bear 4 stars instead of 5.

Overall, in terms of quality it is probably worth the $44 I spent, but not too much more than that. If this were priced at $60 or more I'd definitely think twice.","Great, aside from a few minor issues",True,2
B000VLXDAC,4.0,The kids love this rocking horse. The only issue I have with this is that the saddle doesn't stay in spot.

Other reviewers state it was hard to put together, the one I received was not hard to put together and it looks much more expensive than it is. It would be great in any nursery, for a boy or a girl. But, I hope my boy will get some good use out of it and actually spend a lot of time playing and riding on it.

B000VLXDAC,4.0,"The item shipped very quickly and is just as adorable as the picture. The box arrived a bit damaged, but the toy was fine. Easy to assemble. This was the first item purchased for our new baby's nursery!",rocking giraffe,True,2
B000WOBBAC,5.0,"Not sure what more I can say about Legos. They've been around forever, are durable, colorful, and spark hours of creative, imaginative play. We started my son on Primos or Quattros or what ever they're called (the largest size legos) when he was just 1 yr old, then moved to Duplos, now he is starting to get into the smallest Lego sized blocks.

My son got this set for his 4th birthday. The box says it contains 300 pieces, and I'm going to trust them on that. We certainly had enough pieces to make all 3 vehicles on the box cover, plus a couple of road barriers, and still had enough left over pieces to fill up the dump truck and push around with the front loader.

I guess if there are any ""cons"" to this product, it would be that there is no storage container included in the box. The pieces are divided into several small plastic bags and once you open them, there is no way to put them back. But, if you get the ""ultimate Lego building set"" (which comes with 200 or so pieces in a big ""tupperware"" container)you can always dump these pieces in with the other set. I guess if you want to keep your lego sets separate though, you'll have to figure out an alternate storage solution.

As for the pieces included, this set comes with the regular square and rectangular sized leggos, plus multiple steering wheels, windshields, at least 14 tires, 1 construction worker, and various other sizes, also comes with a little booklet of ideas on building different kinds of construction vehicles. It does have some of the smallest size lego pieces... so watch out around really young children.",another win for Lego toys!,False,
B000WOBBAC,4.0,"My son loves building and especially loves Legos and saw this set and really wanted it and given how great these small Lego's are for hand/finger dexterity as well as further developing a strong pincer grasp we bought them. Right out of the box I could tell that this set was going to be a little difficult for him. There are A LOT of little and TINY pieces and some of the pieces were VERY hard for me to snap in let alone my four year old. But, that didn't stop us, we took our time and slowly went over each step together and looked for all the pieces we needed and really enjoyed building the vehicles. I'm thrilled we purchased this set as we had such a nice time working on this together and as I mentioned Legos are fantastic for the hands/fingers. But I would definately note that the box does say 4+ and unless your child is used to making fairly complex vehicles and has an excellent pincer grasp with pretty strong hands, this will not be something he will be able to do on his own. I did read someone's review who said their 5 year old loves it and had no problems putting these vehicles together, I absolutely believe that as there is a big difference in these particular abilities specifically in boys between 4 and 5. I have mentioned ""he"" or ""boys"" in this review  because although many girls would enjoy this set, girls almost always have a much more highly developed pincer grasp at the age of 4 than boys so I really felt that what I was trying to relay was more boy specific.

Given all the other reviewers did such an excellent job in letting everyone know not only their experience with this set but also what the set contained etc. I did not want to bore everyone with the same information they most likely already read in another review. This review was based on our experiences in order to aid you in your purchasing decision. When it all comes down to it, no one knows your childs abilities better than you do. I think it's important to be able to set proper expectations for a toy and a lot of times the age limits the manufacturers put on the boxes don't quite coincide with a childs abilities at that age. So, I hope this review has given you some additional information as to what you ""may"" experience if buying this for a four year old. Overall, I feel this set is a great buy and fantastic for aiding in the further development of the skills I mentioned above as well as learning to ""read"" the directions (no words are used so even a child who can't read yet can follow the directions) and developing patience, I highly recommend it!",Very nice Lego set but a little difficult for a 4 year old to do on their own...,True,69
B000WOBBAC,5.0,"Legos are a wonderful toy for kids to develop their imagination while also working on fine motor skills.  Plus, they're just plain a lot of fun.

This set includes enough bricks to make three different construction vehicles - a bulldozer, a road grader and a dump truck - at once and still have a handful left over.  When I saw the low price for this set, I was concerned that the vehicles were going to be tiny, but each is about the size of a softball (instead of a Hot Wheels) when assembled.  The box itself is about 10""x10""x""3"", so it's also nicely-sized for gifting.

Every child is different, but our five-year-old had next to no problems with the parts in this set, i.e. while there is a good variety of brick sizes, but nothing overly complex.  The instructions are typical Lego picture-based and lend themselves toward teaching kids the basics of following a plan, looking for visible patterns, and counting dimensions of Lego bricks.  Of course, making the vehicles on the box is enjoyable, but the real fun begins when your child begins creating new ones right from his/her own mind.

If your 4+ year-old enjoys building blocks, creative play, and/or especially construction vehicles, then this is a can't-miss.  The only downside is that you'll probably soon find your child's room taken over by more and more Lego sets!",A Great Value for this Much Lego Fun,True,20
B000WOBBAC,5.0,"What a wonderful set!  This has the best of all worlds:  a set of general-use bricks that are great for creative play, and very good designs for some fun vehicles.  I think this is the best of the creative-play sets that Lego is offering right now (early 2008).",Absolutely great Lego set,True,2
B000WOBBAC,4.0,"This is great!  My 4 year old has had a blast with it.  We sat down and worked through the well-diagrammed instructions to build the dump truck, loader, and steam roller in little more than an hour the first time, about 30 minutes the second time.  He did it with very little help considering he's newly 4.  I would tell him, ""find a skinny red piece with 4 bumps"" (good for counting and description). He'd find it, then look at the picture and he'd figure out where it went with minimal help (good for following directions).  There are several pieces left over to scoop up and put in the dump truck or to build other things.  The booklet gives detailed instructions to build the three vehicles pictured, and shows pictures for various other things you *could* build, but they're too complex to just ""figure it out"" without directions, (that's why I decided to give it 4 stars instead of 5) so basically you just have a bunch of extra Legos to make houses or scoop-and-dump.  But the good thing is you can make all three vehicles at the same time--you don't have to take one apart to use the pieces to make the other.  It's been 8 months now and we haven't lost any of the tiny little pieces, but only because we have a canister vacuum and because we try to dump them out into a jelly roll pan when we play with them.  In the last 8 months, these Legos have been out nearly ever day.",My 4 year old did it with minimal help,False,17
B000WOBBAC,5.0,"This set is wonderful.  I love the fact that the pieces are very basic, it's a perfect starter set.  My son (almost 5) has had this set for nearly a year and he still loves to pull it out and build the trucks, take them apart and build them again.",Fantastic beginner Lego set,True,
B000WOBBAC,5.0,"One reviewer claimed this was expensive for what you get - I felt like it was a lot for the price, given how pricey lego sets are.  You can make quite a few things with this.  (editing 1/10/10 - this set is now selling for more than TWICE what I paid for it - I don't know if the seller is crazy or Lego has d/c'ed it and it's now rare)

My son just turned 5 and this is, I think, just the right level of challenging for him.  This is his first Lego set and he loves it.  I love finally having something to do with him that I think is really fun, too.

Not a toy to be outgrown quickly since you can always add more and more Legos and these are fairly basic, not super specific techy looking pieces.

I see this becoming our standard ~5yo birthday gift.  Good price and good fun!

- Some slight paint imperfections on the body.",Pretty good,False,16
B00115F148,4.0,"Love these a lot, but like the others have noted, tubes don't last very long; and it's very difficult (esp for a child) to get the last 1/4 of the glue to even come out).

B00115F148,4.0,"I love this stuff . . . and not just because I love glitter.

My kids (2 and 4) love these!  The tubes are just soft enough that the 2 year old can squeeze some out but not soft enough that we end up with lakes of glitter glue on the paper (however this is definitely an adult supervision art supply).

I wish it was a little less expensive because on their most artistic days they can clean out a few tubes in one sitting.  However, they love the final results and so do I.  I give this two thumbs way up.

This is a mandatory supply when making Valentine's Day cards.

B0013M4KEQ,4.0,"I really like this product overall.  I didn't worry about my kids playing with it at all as the paint was all natural.  The size of the items was just right and my kids have loved playing with these over the years.  My only real complaint is that the one maraca did break at the seam and I needed to re-glue it together.  Fortunately, none of my kids were hurt in the process of it breaking.  The paint did chip away at the seam of the other one as well, however, it has not yet broken.  The triangle rope holder also comes off easily and has been ""lost"" several times in our house.  That said, it easily slides back on.  The drum also got a hole poked in it shortly after purchase, which was very irritating to me, but this was an issue of my kids not knowing how to properly use it.  My kids tend to be really good with their toys, and this set, while I love it, isn't terribly durable.

The maracas make excellent baby drumsticks - everything goes in his mouth these days so the big bulbous end (which he can't fit into his mouth but likes to try) works perfectly. He waves the maracas all around and is thrilled when he makes contact with the drum.

We have the tambourine w/ drum head as well. Overall the pieces make a nice starter percussion set that should continue to entertain my baby - an help improve his motor skills - for a few years to come.

I put the triangle & metal striker away - maybe I'll introduce that when he's 3 or 4, but no sooner. The maracas and drum should work for any age.","Drum is a little small, but it sounds good and maracas are great!",True,5

B000VLXDAC,5.0,"This is one of the coolest toys we've ever bought for our son.  We've had it for about 3 years now, and I purchased it after our kiddo, who generally shows very little interest in toys, rode a rocking lion at a birthday party her sister was at and got giddy happy about it.  So at the time, elephants were his favorite thing, yes, I know it's a wooly mammoth, but it looks like an elephant to him and it matched the color of an elephant he responded to in one of his books, so I thought he'd think it was even better.

He totally didn't...it took him about 8 months to even touch it, and in the beginning, because he had a hard time with toys that made sounds, the noise this made freaked him out (so that's a cautionary note to any parent with kiddos with sound sensitivity).  But then he slowly started using it, and then he seemed to just fall in love...yippee for me, because he totally doesn't love a lot of toys and this one is great for helping regulate some of his sensory issues.

I think it's something that probably appeals to a wide range and age of kiddos, because I'm constantly having to pull my daughter and her friends off this thing, because they're above the weight limit.  And my son himself is now above it, and will still use it, so we're planning on going with that until it breaks, which it miraculously hasn't yet.

I will say that sometimes the handles loosen up, because they screw on and off by hand, but they are easily tightened down, and it doesn't really present a problem from our perspective.","Very Cool, Sturdy, Durable Rocking Toy",True,

B000VLXDAC,4.0,"I bought this to give to my 19 month old for Christmas this year. I've seen these on other sites for about $50-$90. It was delivered quick and I was unsure when I picked up the box - it is very, very lightweight. However, it was pretty quick to assemble with some basic tools, and it is super cute. The inside feels like it could be made of Styrofoam and it may not last long if you have a rough and tumble little one....but for the price, I am very happy!",Great for Price,False,

B000VLXDAC,5.0,"After a bad experience with the panda rocker, we ordered the giraffe.  We're really pleased.

The problem with the panda was a misshapen face (it was otherwise just fine).  We did not have that problem with this one.  It's really adorable and well-constructed.  I'm looking forward to giving it to my niece for Christmas.

She's 21 months, and I feel confident that it will be a good size for her.  The giraffe is a little smaller than the panda, though it would be hard to tell from the photos and listing information.  Both have a weight limit of 80lb and are recommended for children ages 2 and up.  But I'd say the giraffe's seat is slightly lower and the animal, itself, is a bit smaller looking.  As indicated on the listings, the giraffe weighs a bit less.

As with the panda, this arrived in a brown box with no shipping box or packing material around it.  And it amazes me, but the contents were again just fine.  Since it's a plain box, I plan to give this to her already constructed.  We did assemble it already, as a test, and again I found assembly very easy.  For anyone having issues lining up the legs with the rocker holes, you simply need to realize that the legs do swing a bit to adjust.

I would purchase this again for another child.",just right,True,2

B000VLXDAC,5.0,"Haley the rocking horse is very cute.  I gave it as a baby shower gift for a couple that doesn't know if their baby is a boy or a girl and with a western themed baby shower.  It received many oohs and ahhs. Our Haley's saddle stirrups are uneven, but still very cute.  I hope they wouldn't be dangerous for the little one. The saddle itself doesn't lie perfectly smooth, but probably just needs to be sat on a few times.  I think it might be better without the saddle, but it does give it a more western touch and it's not removable.  I pulled some of the mane and tail ""hair"" free from the seams and it was even better. The coat is short very soft plush that should be fairly easily spot cleaned. The ears were a little flat when I first unpacked the horse, but they were easily reshaped. The assembly was very easy.  My husband added little wooden plugs over the screws which he thought gave it a better finished look.  I ordered ""used"" from the warehouse and it was a new item with just minor damage to the inner box with the contents not damaged at all.  I cannot tell how durable the horse will be but it feels very sturdy and I would expect it to be up to lots of loving from this lovingly expected child for several years to come.

B000VLXDAC,5.0,"I really researched a lot of rocking horses before choosing this Happy Trails Rocking Horse.  I am so glad that I did, because it is wonderful and my daughter loves it!  I bought it early in December for Christmas and I didn't even take it out of the box until Christmas Eve night.  The box itself seems a lot lighter than you would expect a rocking horse to be.  But when we did finally open it up, my husband and I were very pleased to see that you only have to install the horse onto the wood rocking platform.  One of the legs was a little tricky, and I think it's because we screwed the other 3 legs onto it pretty tight.  So when you are doing it, don't screw them in entirely until you have all 4 legs on.  The horse is really cute, the fur has soft feel and it is solid but whatever it is stuffed with doesn't make it really hard.  The horse has wood handles, a saddle with stirrups and wood rocking base.  My daughter is 2 years 7 months but is as tall as an average 4 year old and this guy is still a tiny bit tall for her.  She can get up on him now with some practice but still needs someone to stand next to her incase she goes tumbling onto the other side (it has almost happened 2 times now).  It only took her 2 times to figure out to rock herself.  She loves it and so will your little one!!","Love it, I am so glad I picked out this one!",True,4
B000VLXDAC,4.0,"Our three year old granddaughter had it in her head she wanted a rocking horse. She had seen one in Home Depot that made noise and moved it's ears and tail. But it was very low to the ground and she is a little tall. When we purchased this one I did read all the reviews but my bad.....didn't notice it didn't do anything. But 2 days before Christmas there was nothing we could do at this point. She opened it, and absolutely loves it. She didn't care or even ask if anything moved. IF you want it to do something there is another version of this same horse but it's also quite a bit more money. She is so happy with it and her parents say she doesn't want to get off of it.

B000VLXDAC,4.0,"I've seen these for awhile and wanted to get one for our youngest who is just under 1 year old. We sort of have a baby animal theme for him. I feel like this one closely resembles the Pier 1 rocking elephant and at a much better value. It arrived in a large box in 4 main pieces (elephant, wooden rocker, and two side handles) along with some screws and washers. I put it together myself and it wasn't too bad. The rocker part screws into the screws vertically on the elephant's feet. I had to sort of stretch the back legs apart in order to get it to go on because the alignment was a bit off. The handles went on easily. It took less than 10 minutes and would have been much quicker had the back legs been aligned properly. My biggest concern with this item is that there were 5 dark spots on it that were pretty dirty. I had to recheck my order because I know I purchased this item brand new and it seemed like someone else had returned it. Either way, I think the elephant rocker is super cute. I think it's a great size for our 10 month old and it holds enough weight that our 2 year old can probably safely enjoy it as well. We have it hidden and will put it out Christmas morning with a big red bow. I can't wait to see our son's reaction! If you're looking for something like this, be sure to see the selection they have available. They have soooo many animals to choose from and they are all really adorable!","So cute, easy to assemble, and great height for baby's first rocker",True,

B000VLXDAC,4.0,"The base came pre-assembled and in great condition (though cheap pine wood). All I had to do was put the screw pegs at the bottom of the hooves into the pre-made holes on the base, and put on the washers and tighten the bolts. Then I used my hands to screw on the handles.
It boasts having a weight limit of 80 lbs. I am around 110 lbs and I decided to test it out. It held my weight for the few seconds I sat on it, and the product did not bend or buckle. It shows no signs of being sat on by me.
The eyes are really off-center and one is deeper than the other. I actually started cracking up because the horse looks ridiculous. I played around with the fabric but didn't find an easy way to fix this. One of the nostrils was flat and the other was in (like a nostril hole should be), so I just played with the other one until it went in. It's not like kids are going to be staring at the face and judging the appearance, but it's something that could have been done better.
I would never, ever pay full price for this (as of this review, asking price is $125). I got it for $40. I'm satisfied with that price.
I saw some concerns about certain rockers not having sound. Lil Henry does not advertise having any sounds, as of the date I'm writing this review. The instructions do show how to place batteries, but that is because the instructions are not specific to the model you receive.
I hope the toddler likes this, we have about a month to wait yet until we give it to him!","Lil Henry, very nice",False,2

B000VLXDAC,4.0,"Bought this for Xmas and my 18 month old son was terrified of it, but over time got used to him and now he loves his horse.  I had a hard time trying to decide on this one or another that was taller, but I chose this one.  My son is in the 90th percentile for height and weight and I'm 5'10""  so we're not small people.  This horse was the perfect size.  My sons feet barely touched the wooden footholds and the horse, six months later, is still my son's size and he's still 90th percentile.  The only downside is the smell that it gives off and how loud the horse sings.  I simply aired out the horse in my storage room for a few weeks.  No doubt there are evil chemicals in this, but if I tired to eliminate all chemicals from our life I'd drive myself crazy and would have to quit my job.  As far as how loud the horse sings, there's no way to dampen it unless you wrap a ""scarf"" around the neck.  My decision: take the batteries out.  Can't give five stars because of the off gassing and high decibels on the voice box.  However, high marks because of the fun and affection my son has with and for his horse.",Happy Happy Trails,True,

I would have given the giraffe a 5-star review but since it's reportedly appropriate for a one-year old, I think there should be some type of strap to hold the child from slipping off.  Perhaps it really isn't made for a child that young (the age appropriate info may have come from reviews).  If the company somewhere indicates an age limit of 2 and up, I would give this product a full 5-stars for sure.  Also, the giraffe is very sturdy.

The sound effects are hysterical, and given the fact that she has been on this horse constantly, it is well built.  You can probably tell from the picture, but I'll mention it anyway: one can still get a finger or toe completely crushed under this thing, there is no safety mechanism for that at all.",3 yr old daughter's Christmas Gift,True,
B000VLXDAC,4.0,"I purchased this horse for my taller-than-average  3 year old daughter It has been a huge hit with her, and it looked adorable next to the tree Christmas morning.

The size is perfect for this age - she had to practice getting on and off a few times. It will allow her to easily grow a couple inches with it. We have NOT had any problems with it tipping while rocking, as others have mentioned.

The horse is very lightweight, easy to assemble, and visually pleasing. However, the materials do feel low quality. I don't expect the saddle and stirrups to last very long.

So far, I don't mind the sound effects, my daughter really likes the song, and it adds to the personality in my opinion. I feel $60 is a fair price for the quality. I don't expect this horse to become a family heirloom.

B000VLXDAC,5.0,This was a Christmas gift for my 15 month old son. He loves it! His feet couldn't quite touch while he was riding but that didn't stop him one bit. It came with the base already assembled so all I had to do was attach the plush horse to it by 4 nuts with washers. Very Easy!! It seems to be made of a decent quality. The base is just sanded pine without any varnish so it might be susceptible to liquids. It does not come with batteries and truth be told Im ok with it.

I did have to re-shape the legs a bit to line them up with the holes, but I think that was just from being packed in the box.  It's actually quite plush rather than just fur over plastic or wood and looks just like the photo.  The rockers and handles are wood although probably just pine.  It does seem to be a soft wood and dings easily.  It's pretty large for my toddler at this time, but I'm certain she will grow into it and love it in a few months.

When I put her on it to see how tall it was, it was taller than I expected.  I'll probably save it as a present for her next birthday because it's something that a child would have to be older for because it is tall and doesn't come with any straps or anything to hold the child on it and it looks like something they could easily fall off if they're not tall enough.

B000VLXDAC,4.0,"It was easy to put together for the most part, one of the legs was rather difficult to screw into the rocking base, because it was farther forward than it should have been, so the screw had to go into the wood at an angle. Otherwise it went together easily, and looks absolutely adorable! I was able to set it up on my own at 7 months pregnant. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the strange puffy cheek jowls. They don't stand out too much in the picture, but in person they do, and are really weird looking.

B000VLXDAC,4.0,"This was a Christmas gift for my 2-year-old. At this age she is not very interested in it (in fact she's kind of scared to be on it) but I know it will grow on her (my older kid didn't like rocking animals until age 4 or so). Her younger sister will sit on it (she's 1, so we hold onto her while she's on it) and she actually enjoys it for brief periods. We have 2 toddlers right now so I am sure this bear will be used a lot ... eventually.

What I am rating in this review is the bear itself, since my kids can't use it much yet.

The bear did arrive with a few scratches on the wood - there are some large screws on the feet of the animal that contacted the wood while in shipping. Basically, to assemble it you need to line up these screws on the feet with the wooden base and push them in, then secure the bottom. It did require 2 people to get the screws on the feet aligned with the base (the legs are pretty solid and have some resistance), but it only took about 5 minutes. The trick is to do it without scratching the wooden base, since it is pretty soft wood.

The handles are screwed into the head, although one does keep coming loose like another reviewer stated. That and the lopsided head are the reason I gave this bear 4 stars instead of 5.

Overall, in terms of quality it is probably worth the $44 I spent, but not too much more than that. If this were priced at $60 or more I'd definitely think twice.","Great, aside from a few minor issues",True,2
B000VLXDAC,4.0,The kids love this rocking horse. The only issue I have with this is that the saddle doesn't stay in spot.  I will end up putting a gripper mat for rugs between the saddle and the horse. I bought this for my 21m for christmas. But my 4yr plays with this more than the 2yr old.

I have a fairly tall 2 year old boy (he's in the 90th percentile) so I wanted something he could rock on that is also soft but a good size and for the price, this was a great deal!

Other reviewers state it was hard to put together, the one I received was not hard to put together and it looks much more expensive than it is. It would be great in any nursery, for a boy or a girl. But, I hope my boy will get some good use out of it and actually spend a lot of time playing and riding on it.

B000WOBBAC,5.0,"Not sure what more I can say about Legos. They've been around forever, are durable, colorful, and spark hours of creative, imaginative play. We started my son on Primos or Quattros or what ever they're called (the largest size legos) when he was just 1 yr old, then moved to Duplos, now he is starting to get into the smallest Lego sized blocks.

My son got this set for his 4th birthday. The box says it contains 300 pieces, and I'm going to trust them on that. We certainly had enough pieces to make all 3 vehicles on the box cover, plus a couple of road barriers, and still had enough left over pieces to fill up the dump truck and push around with the front loader.

I guess if there are any ""cons"" to this product, it would be that there is no storage container included in the box. The pieces are divided into several small plastic bags and once you open them, there is no way to put them back. But, if you get the ""ultimate Lego building set"" (which comes with 200 or so pieces in a big ""tupperware"" container)you can always dump these pieces in with the other set. I guess if you want to keep your lego sets separate though, you'll have to figure out an alternate storage solution.

As for the pieces included, this set comes with the regular square and rectangular sized leggos, plus multiple steering wheels, windshields, at least 14 tires, 1 construction worker, and various other sizes, also comes with a little booklet of ideas on building different kinds of construction vehicles. It does have some of the smallest size lego pieces... so watch out around really young children.",another win for Lego toys!,False,
B000WOBBAC,4.0,"My son loves building and especially loves Legos and saw this set and really wanted it and given how great these small Lego's are for hand/finger dexterity as well as further developing a strong pincer grasp we bought them. Right out of the box I could tell that this set was going to be a little difficult for him. There are A LOT of little and TINY pieces and some of the pieces were VERY hard for me to snap in let alone my four year old. But, that didn't stop us, we took our time and slowly went over each step together and looked for all the pieces we needed and really enjoyed building the vehicles. I'm thrilled we purchased this set as we had such a nice time working on this together and as I mentioned Legos are fantastic for the hands/fingers. But I would definately note that the box does say 4+ and unless your child is used to making fairly complex vehicles and has an excellent pincer grasp with pretty strong hands, this will not be something he will be able to do on his own. I did read someone's review who said their 5 year old loves it and had no problems putting these vehicles together, I absolutely believe that as there is a big difference in these particular abilities specifically in boys between 4 and 5. I have mentioned ""he"" or ""boys"" in this review  because although many girls would enjoy this set, girls almost always have a much more highly developed pincer grasp at the age of 4 than boys so I really felt that what I was trying to relay was more boy specific.

Given all the other reviewers did such an excellent job in letting everyone know not only their experience with this set but also what the set contained etc. I did not want to bore everyone with the same information they most likely already read in another review. This review was based on our experiences in order to aid you in your purchasing decision. When it all comes down to it, no one knows your childs abilities better than you do. I think it's important to be able to set proper expectations for a toy and a lot of times the age limits the manufacturers put on the boxes don't quite coincide with a childs abilities at that age. So, I hope this review has given you some additional information as to what you ""may"" experience if buying this for a four year old. Overall, I feel this set is a great buy and fantastic for aiding in the further development of the skills I mentioned above as well as learning to ""read"" the directions (no words are used so even a child who can't read yet can follow the directions) and developing patience, I highly recommend it!",Very nice Lego set but a little difficult for a 4 year old to do on their own...,True,69
B000WOBBAC,5.0,"Legos are a wonderful toy for kids to develop their imagination while also working on fine motor skills.  Plus, they're just plain a lot of fun.

This set includes enough bricks to make three different construction vehicles - a bulldozer, a road grader and a dump truck - at once and still have a handful left over.  When I saw the low price for this set, I was concerned that the vehicles were going to be tiny, but each is about the size of a softball (instead of a Hot Wheels) when assembled.  The box itself is about 10""x10""x""3"", so it's also nicely-sized for gifting.

Every child is different, but our five-year-old had next to no problems with the parts in this set, i.e. while there is a good variety of brick sizes, but nothing overly complex.  The instructions are typical Lego picture-based and lend themselves toward teaching kids the basics of following a plan, looking for visible patterns, and counting dimensions of Lego bricks.  Of course, making the vehicles on the box is enjoyable, but the real fun begins when your child begins creating new ones right from his/her own mind.

If your 4+ year-old enjoys building blocks, creative play, and/or especially construction vehicles, then this is a can't-miss.  The only downside is that you'll probably soon find your child's room taken over by more and more Lego sets!",A Great Value for this Much Lego Fun,True,20
B000WOBBAC,5.0,"What a wonderful set!  This has the best of all worlds:  a set of general-use bricks that are great for creative play, and very good designs for some fun vehicles.  I think this is the best of the creative-play sets that Lego is offering right now (early 2008).",Absolutely great Lego set,True,2
B000WOBBAC,4.0,"This is great!  My 4 year old has had a blast with it.  We sat down and worked through the well-diagrammed instructions to build the dump truck, loader, and steam roller in little more than an hour the first time, about 30 minutes the second time.  He did it with very little help considering he's newly 4.  I would tell him, ""find a skinny red piece with 4 bumps"" (good for counting and description). He'd find it, then look at the picture and he'd figure out where it went with minimal help (good for following directions).  There are several pieces left over to scoop up and put in the dump truck or to build other things.  The booklet gives detailed instructions to build the three vehicles pictured, and shows pictures for various other things you *could* build, but they're too complex to just ""figure it out"" without directions, (that's why I decided to give it 4 stars instead of 5) so basically you just have a bunch of extra Legos to make houses or scoop-and-dump.  But the good thing is you can make all three vehicles at the same time--you don't have to take one apart to use the pieces to make the other.  It's been 8 months now and we haven't lost any of the tiny little pieces, but only because we have a canister vacuum and because we try to dump them out into a jelly roll pan when we play with them.  In the last 8 months, these Legos have been out nearly ever day.",My 4 year old did it with minimal help,False,17
B000WOBBAC,5.0,"This set is wonderful.  I love the fact that the pieces are very basic, it's a perfect starter set.  My son (almost 5) has had this set for nearly a year and he still loves to pull it out and build the trucks, take them apart and build them again.",Fantastic beginner Lego set,True,
B000WOBBAC,5.0,"One reviewer claimed this was expensive for what you get - I felt like it was a lot for the price, given how pricey lego sets are.  You can make quite a few things with this.  (editing 1/10/10 - this set is now selling for more than TWICE what I paid for it - I don't know if the seller is crazy or Lego has d/c'ed it and it's now rare)

My son just turned 5 and this is, I think, just the right level of challenging for him.  This is his first Lego set and he loves it.  I love finally having something to do with him that I think is really fun, too.

Not a toy to be outgrown quickly since you can always add more and more Legos and these are fairly basic, not super specific techy looking pieces.

I wish it was a little less expensive because on their most artistic days they can clean out a few tubes in one sitting.  However, they love the final results and so do I.  I give this two thumbs way up.

The size of the items was just right and my kids have loved playing with these over the years.  My only real complaint is that the one maraca did break at the seam and I needed to re-glue it together.  Fortunately, none of my kids were hurt in the process of it breaking.  The paint did chip away at the seam of the other one as well, however, it has not yet broken.  The triangle rope holder also comes off easily and has been ""lost"" several times in our house.  That said, it easily slides back on.  The drum also got a hole poked in it shortly after purchase, which was very irritating to me, but this was an issue of my kids not knowing how to properly use it.  My kids tend to be really good with their toys, and this set, while I love it, isn't terribly durable.

He waves the maracas all around and is thrilled when he makes contact with the drum.

We have the tambourine w/ drum head as well. Overall the pieces make a nice starter percussion set that should continue to entertain my baby - an help improve his motor skills - for a few years to come.

B001KW063I,5.0,"We bought this for our 8-year old daughter for a car trip out of state a month ago that would include some evening driving time.  She was very excited to use it and the Dome lived up to her anticipation!  I had read the other reviews after purchasing and will admit I was concerned.

Our experience:

All of our markers work perfectly (not dry at all) and seem to be staying same in a ziploc bag (also keeps them together more easily when not in use, although the board itself has ample snap-in storage room for all the markers + 4 extra you can buy).

The drawing surfaces are easy to interchange, snap in and out, and illuminate.

The complete board is lightweight enough to be comfortable for a long period on a lap in a car, and is easy to manipulate without dropping pieces.

The board has been very easy to clean.  After reading other reviews, and knowing we would be in the car, I wet (and wrung out) an old lightweight washcloth and put in in a small ziploc bag.  It was easy to wipe the board completely and without streaking.  The washcloth (even when I used it) left no scratches on our screens.  We used a paper (restaurant) napkin to gently dry the board and it left no scratches either.  BONUS: the color did NOT transfer from the washcloth onto skin or clothing (I was SO pleased - thanks, Crayola!!).  The washcloth rinsed clean almost as soon as it hit the water when we returned home and I washed it; yippee!

Our daughter REALLY LIKES this product.  She has a great many (okay, read perhaps 'too many') arts and crafts supplies and 'devices'.  She enjoys most of them very much.  She was quite impressed (making me so, too) with this Crayola Board and was excited to reuse it.","EASY to use, VERY FUN",False,
B001KW063I,4.0,"My son got this Christmas '08.  Everyone loved it.  Not just him but his cousins, him, our neighbors son, all of his friends. It has been a great investment.  It has endured many hours of travel in the car, plane, and toy box.  I would say that proves that it is durable.  We don't let kids jump on it or anything but it has been around for over a year now.  The little stencils that come with are kind of beat up but the board itself has held up. The draw back that I find is that it doesn't work except in the dark - so during the day it can be difficult for the kids to find a good place to play with it - sometimes a dark bathroom or closet works.  But not in the car or such.  But it is a lifesaver at night in the car or on a plane at night.  He likes to play it in his room at night.  It doesn't have the same appeal to him as it did when it was new but he does still play with it & he always comes back to it - much like the doodle boards.  They now have a day/night version but this x-mas it was listing at more than $50 so if that comes down I will get him one of those so he can play with it anytime as it is a staple around our house anyway.",Kids love the Glow Board,True,3.0
B001KW063I,4.0,"I purchased this for my 3 yr old and after reading the reviews I can't help at laughing.  Some are complaining that you can't use it during the day- it is a GLOW station, I don't know of anything that glows in the ""light"" it does normally have to be dark.  And some are complaining that it isn't more stationary.. it is the ON THE GO board..meaning it is portable, there is a larger one that is stationary, but this is not it.  The product is what it states it is, and it's not misleading.  It's great for the car at night, and at bedtime.  Like any other item that glows in the dark, it does have to be exposed to light to ""recharge"".  My daughter loves it and has gotten a lot of use from it.",It is what it says it is,False,30.0
B001KW063I,4.0,"I bought this for my 2 year olds birthday.  Yes I know the recommended age, but my two kids (2 and almost 4) absolutely love this.  It does work with out complete darkness and yes it does fade quickly which is why I think younger children will enjoy it.  What I have noticed is that it is hard to draw well with the light pen as whenever the pen approaches the board it makes a glow circle as it approaches which I think would frustrate children that can draw.  It is very hard to do any real pictures or writing due to this issue.  Younger kids do not mind as they scribble or do circles and then laugh about the cool neon green color they created.  My friend and I tried to write basic names and were not impressed with how they turned out so if your child is a perfectionist and wants to make pictures that are even slightly complicated I would not suggest this toy.  Otherwise it is a wonderful toy to use before bed or just to waste time when parents need a little bit of time to accomplish .  I also think that it is very thin and does not look durable....should not be an issue if your kids don't stand on it though :)",I would say this is better for younger children,False,9.0

I can easily understand the phrases that they are saying. The batteries are included so they are ready to use. The back of the box has a picture that shows how to change the batteries.

Jessie's face, hands, boots, belt, and hat are plastic.  The rest of her body is stuffed fabric.  The fabric is thick and well sewn. Her hair is made of red yarn that is pulled together in a pony tail with a yellow ribbon around it.  Her arms are sewn across where the knees and elbows should be.  This helps the arms and legs to bend easily.  She is absolutely precious!

Woody's face, hands, belt, shirt buttons, boots, belt, holster, and hat are plastic.  Like, Jessie the rest of his body is made with a good, thick fabric that is well sewn.  I was concerned that that the buttons on his shirt might easily be pulled off, but they appear to be well secured.  I pulled on them and they did not come off.  His knees & elbows, like Jessie, are sewn across so that he can easily bend his arms, legs, sit, etc.  My only disappointment with Woody is that like all toys with strings mechanisms for talking, they become a little loose and don't recoil all the way in after a while.  The Woody that I received already has about an inch of string that stays out when it recoils back in.  He still speaks well though.

The recommended age on the package is 3+.  I am giving these as a gift to my grandson who will soon be 4 years old.

So we went ahead and added the bathtime version to his collection. It's a lot smaller than the others and doesn't float well like it seems it should and the water doesn't ""spit"" well out of the mouth so I find myself draining water out of it constantly (but you gotta do that w the rubber duckies too). At the end of the day my kid could care less about those things-- it's a sophie! And Sophie makes him smile so it's worth it",We love Sophie!,True,
B004C4445M,5.0,My toddler loves biting and playing with this toy in and out of the bath. There is really not much more I could say about Sophie.,Sophie seems like she has become a member of the family,True,
B004C4445M,5.0,"There are a LOT of negative reviews for this toy based upon the fact that it might not be made from natural rubber and therefore MIGHT not be safe for babies to chew on, so I felt compelled to share my experience with it.

I understand that babies (especially teething babies) tend to put EVERYTHING in their mouths, and I understand wanting to be sure that the toys they will be chewing on are made of safe materials. However, given that my son is exposed to this toy only at bath time, and only under adult supervision, I was not overly concerned about it, especially since I could find no evidence that the toy was made out of anything harmful. In fact that ended up being a moot point because although my son is 7 months, and chews on everything, he somehow doesn't find this toy pleasant to teethe on (yes, I let him try when he was playing with it).

I will admit that this toy does have some flaws: If you are looking for it to float around in the tub neatly, it doesn't do that (unless partially filled with water). It's not for teething on, and it's not easy for very small babies to squirt by themselves.

That being said, I still think this is a fantastic toy!

So why do I think this toy merits a 5-star review, given all its flaws? Because it is by far the toy we play with the most at bathtime. I love filling it with water and squirting my son with it, and he always shrieks with giggles and tries to grab it and dunk it under water (it has the best squirting range of any of the bath toys we have). If it's on the other side of the tub, it's the toy he reaches for, and it's the one I play with myself when he's distracted. I believe that the intention of the toy is not just to give a baby something to entertain him(or her)self with at bath time, but to provide a fun toy that both parent and baby can enjoy playing with together. And it works.

And for those who say it is ""hard to squirt""- not if you know how! Simply grasp the toy by the colored part (most easily done by placing the toy between the pointer and middle fingers), and push up on the bottoms of Sophie's feet (with the thumb). It's well-designed in that capacity!

I hope this review helps you :)",GREAT for what it is marketed as-- a BATH toy.,True,3

B004D3A9AG,5.0,"I love this game. Even my husband likes it and he's not into worker-placement games. I'm not either, but this isn't like other games of that type. It has just enough strategy/choices to be interesting, but not so many as to be overwhelming or to induce analysis paralysis. The designers have even incorporated an easy way to make the game less complicated for beginners. By simply flipping over a couple of the modular board pieces, two turn options are excluded from play. A home rule you may want to adopt (which I took from friends who played incorrectly their first time), especially if you're playing with children, is to allow any color card to be used when a player wishes to build. If there are any drawbacks to Asara, I'd say the rules might be one. For some reason, it's been scored differently EVERY TIME I've played. What we have agreed on is that the entire scoring track will never be needed as long as Asara is only a four-player game. Make sure you have the game punched BEFORE you ask if anyone wants to play, and allow for extra time for set-up. You'll enjoy this Ravensburger game.",Attractive and fun,True,3

B004D3A9AG,5.0,"Asara is an easy-to-learn game with only 6 pages of instructions (once you find the correct language in the book! :D ) and is definitely appropriate for the 9+ ages suggested. While this game is easy to learn, it is also pretty fun to play -AND it allows for some strategic thinking to get the most, the highest, and the best towers built!! We played 4 players, we didn't have a runaway winner, and the end totally surprised us!

I definitely recommend this for hobby game beginners as well as more advanced gamers!",Excellent game! Easy to learn/play! GREAT for families!!,True,
B004D3A9AG,4.0,"I chose this game thinking that it would make a great strategy game for the family to play.  We've owned it for quite some time now, and while I enjoy it, it's definitely not for younger children.  The rules are simple enough for a family to understand; however, the logic that is required to be able to win the game is not something that 9-year old children are generally capable of utilizing.

The game itself is interesting.  The players are each architects and the goal is to build towers which earn them prestige points.  The towers are purchased part by part at the marketplace.  The different colors represent the different grades of materials available.  There are enough steps to keep it interesting without becoming overly complex.  As with most logic games, the game is never the exact same twice.  The trick to it is to create the best strategy to get the best pieces and earn more prestige than the other architects.

This is definitely a different style of game.  It's all about thinking and strategizing.  I wish that there were a younger version of it.  We have the children's version of Settlers of Catan and Ticket to Ride.  As it stands, it needs to be reserved for older children, teens and adults to avoid frustration.",A thinking game for older children and adults,False,
B004D3A9AG,4.0,"Asara is a significant strategic step up from the classic board games like Risk, Stratego and Settlers of Catan. Whether or not, after the time commitment to learn the rules, get comfortable with the gameplay and develop strategies, your family will enjoy the game is a matter of taste.

The manufacturer recommends the game for ages 9 and up but that may be a bit young, depending on your child's skills and interest. Ages 12 and up is a better range as this game takes more time to learn and develop strategies. Expect a longer-than-expected time commitment for younger and casual players to understand the rules and become comfortable with the gameplay.

The focus on the game is tower building and to accomplish that each player has to assemble the resources necessary for construction. Allocation of resources involves identifying buyers and parts markets for specific needs. Winning is achieved by building the tallest and most opulent (color) tower, with points awarded for each feature.

PROS:

* The high-quality components - game board, coins, cards and tokens - all greatly exceed the cheap, plastic construction now commonplace in classic board games like Monopoly.

* Once all the players are adept at the game rules, a standard game can be played in under an hour.

CON:

* Ravensburger needs to edit and rewrite the English instructions, which are neither clear nor intuitive. Translated from German, the instructions

In summary, your personal gaming background will weigh heavily on how much you enjoy the game. Experienced gamers, especially those who have played other German-designed board games, probably won't find enough depth here to make this a favorite. At the same token, young and casual gamers might find Asara too big a jump from the Settlers of Catan.

Rating: Five stars for quality of construction; three stars for game play; four stars overall.

B004D3A9AG,5.0,"I'm an avid gamer, and have about 20 board games of the Euro-variety in my gaming rotation.  I'm always looking for ""the next great game"" since learning a new game is half of the fun.  I usually look for games that have a balance of strategy and luck, great re-playability, and rules that don't require two hours to read through.  Since I play with a mix of hardcore and new gamers, it's also good to find games that aren't too overwhelming to teach or learn, but are interesting enough not to bore the hardcore set.

Happily, Asara is a new game that fits all my criteria.

1.  The rules were pretty straightforward, although like most games it's easier to learn as you play than just read the rules first.
2.  There's just the right amount strategy, not only in what pieces you need to complete your towers, but how to block your opponents and guessing what they might be up to.  Luck comes into play in what pieces appear, since your strategy could hinge on just the right tower piece popping up before the other guy finishes his final tower.
3.  I'll want to play this over and over just to try out different strategies.  It's also a very different game depending on how many players you have.
4.  New and serious gamers can both get something out of this game.  It's not going to challenge you like, say, Dungeon Lords, Pandemic, or Castle Ravenloft, but it's not as simplistic as Kingsburg or Coloretto, either.  I'd rank it around the complexity level of Stone Age or Tikal, just below Settlers or Carcassone (with expansions).  For fun, I'd put it in about the same place, although that depends on your preferred genre, of course.

This game plays well with 2 players (a rare thing, but a great bonus), and scales up well.  The only improvement I could see would be adding more interaction among players, since you're pretty much building your towers in isolation while keeping an eye on everyone else.  But as a thoughtful, fun take on a classic ""build the towers/cities/empire"" concept, this game is a keeper.",A good game to add to your game night rotation,False,
B004D3A9AG,5.0,"Asara is a easy to learn board game that has two features that I believe every boardgame must have to be enjoyable:  it can be played in less than an hour, and everyone has something to do on each turn.  There is no waiting around, in fact, if you bide your time you will probably lose.  The game moves very quickly once you learn it, and it can be learned well in just an hour or two.  The art style is beautiful and simple, and the game becomes much more complex as players realize they are competing over a very limited pool of resources, even if it initially seems unlimited.  The entire game can turn upon who decides to do what in the final turn, and well-laid plans come to naught because two players were trying to use the same resource.

The only complaint I have is that some of the tie-breaking scoring rules are a bit murky, but if you just leave it to house rules there will be no problem.",Easy to learn and fun to play,False,

If you're comfortable with Carcassone, Ticket to Ride, or Dominion Asara should be simple to learn. If you haven't played these style of games you may have a steeper learning curve.

Unlike some games that take hours Asara is fairly quick if you play a 2 player game.",Great Game Play,False,
B004D3A9AG,4.0,"We've purchased many of the European games in the past and I was eager to give Asura a try.  Hallmarks of the Euro games are beautiful illustrations, quality game pieces, and games that are different and challenging (and not insulting the intelligence of the children or the parents).

The strategy is simple but multifaceted: you have 4 years to wheel to acquire and manage your resources to build as many (and as tall) towers as you can.  Points are awarded for size, amount, and quality (color) of the tower pieces.

Plan to invest a bit of time in the beginning to get the game down.  It does seem complicated (lots of pieces, lots of directions) but once you get to playing, it all makes sense.  My 9 year old had no problem learning it at all.

An added bonus is that there are different rules - so the game can be played different ways. You can play it as casual gamers/family night or you can play with friends for a competitive game night.

In all, a beautiful game with interesting game play and a lot of versatility.",Great Family Game,False,
B004D3A9AG,4.0,"When we first opened the box and started punching out all the various pieces and trying to assemble the game board, I privately thought it was going to be way more complicated than what my family would enjoy. We are casual gamers-- usually enjoying games that can be played in less than an hour with a variety of ages and thinking abilities. I honestly thought this was going to be one of those multi-level, complex role-playing type games that take a minimum of several hours and lots of strategizing. But we wanted to try it. We got the board set up... thanks to a very detailed ""crib sheet"" that was included. Then we read through the rules and got started. After a couple of rounds everyone began to catch on, and we found ourselves enjoying it. It was not nearly as complicated as we thought, and really a lot of fun.

The basic premise is that players are competing to build towers by collecting pieces. The base and top are required pieces, so you have to have at least those two pieces to start your tower. You can have any number of middle pieces. Points are awarded based on color (some colors are worth more points than others), size of tower (number of pieces in a single tower), and number of towers a player has. So there is some thinking and strategy to it, but it's not terribly complicated. Just perfect for a fun, family game night for school age kids to adults.

Also, the quality of workmanship in the game is outstanding. The pieces are very sturdy cardboard, printed on both sides, with wooden markers.",More fun than we expected!,False,
B004D3A9AG,5.0,"I played this game for the first time with some friends last weekend. We were all new to the game. Unlike some games, this one only has a few pages of rules to go through, so it's pretty easy for a group of new players to get into it. After the game was over, we all thought it was an interesting game. We each had some ideas about things we would have done differently if we could start over from the beginning.

A couple of strategic tips that weren't immediately obvious from reading the rules the first time:
1) Buy and play as many of the gold-decorated building pieces as you can, as early in the game as you can. Once these have been installed in a tower, they each earn you one point at the end of each year.
2) None of the top pieces have gold decorations except for the white ones, which all do. For the other three tower section types, there is one gold-decorated piece per section type per color.
3) Until the final evaluation at the end of the game, there seems to be little advantage to having the expensive-colored towers instead of the cheap-colored ones. It might therefore be advantageous to buy and play the cheaper tower sections first to reduce the need for wasting a turn on getting extra funds earlier in the game.

I am looking forward to my next chance to play this game and try to do some things differently, which is a good sign as far as replayability is concerned. Also aiding this game's replay value is the inclusion of a ""professional"" rules set that you can try to bring some new twists into the game once you've gotten the hang of the basic rules. I have not yet played with the professional rules, but they look like they do bring some simple yet radical changes to the way the game works.",Fun game,False,
B004D3A9AG,4.0,"We played Asara for the first time this week with two other adult friends that are also die-hard board gamers.

From the looks of it, Asara has tons of pieces and we all expected it to be somewhere in the ballpark of Small World or Puerto Rico, semi-complex games with tons of rules and subtleties.  Asara is actually a fairly straightforward family game with a solid mix of easy-to-grasp strategy elements.  The goal is to build as many towers as possible, and to build them as tall as possible.  Gold (Asari) is in demand, but is never all that difficult to get, and you always have a move available that will benefit you in some form.  The game also limits the amount of time invested as you only play four 'turns'.  There are four short rounds of building, and then you score your progress and the game is over!  The very first time we played it, we were done in about an hour.

The actual game pieces are very high quality cardboard, and the game board is large, but fits together like a puzzle so you're not bumping pieces out of alignment constantly (I'm looking at you, old school Settlers of Catan...).  The rules were very easy to understand, and different ideas about strategies were easy to decipher even early on in the game.  The game is recommended for ages 9-99, and I would say that is accurate.  Nine year olds can grasp the concept of building a tower, and making color-coded moves to achieve their goals.

Don't let the massive amount of pieces throw you off, Asara is well-designed and a lot of fun.  More pieces = bigger towers!","Lots of fun, and looks more intimidating than it actually is",False,
B004D3A9AG,4.0,"I have played a few euro-type games (settlers of catan, puerto rico, etc), and most of them are denser in rules but much richer in game play. Unfortunately, because of the nature of them, they are a bit tougher to play with younger kids. so I was designed for the whole family I was intrigued.

We sat down with  our kids and learned to play this game. At first we had a rough start, although after a reasonable amount of time, we all enjoyed playing it.

As others have said, this is not a typical board game. The game play is much richer and strategic then your typical ""roll the dice, move your piece and perform action"" type game. The concept of the game is simple, to make towers. And there are a few different levels of the game, we obviously started with the simplest. After playing it once or twice, my kids caught on and it was a very enjoyable game. A nice bonus is even though it is family friendly, at no time did I feel like I was playing a kiddie-game.

If you take the time to learn the rules you will probably really enjoy this game. Although soon after learning this game, you may find that typical board games no longer hold your interest.",Worth the time needed to learn to play.,False,
B004D3A9AG,4.0,"This was an easy game to learn, if your family is like mine and plays a lot of Euros.  Once the players get the hang of maximizing the efficiency of their actions and calculating the amount of funds needed, this quickly turns into a fierce competition for limited building resources and building opportunities.  Like most Euros, there is no one guaranteed strategy for success, which guarantees variety of play.

This definitely falls into the category of a family game.  There is some depth to be found here, but hardcore gamers would certainly tire of this quickly.  Kids will enjoy putting together the towers, although in our first game, my daughter's single-minded quest to build the highest tower using the (most expensive) white components left her well short in prestige points when all was said and done.

However, she was happy to play it again.

Probably not the best choice for those who consider Monopoly to be the standard for board games, but if you can get your head around mechanics which don't involve endless rolling of the dice, you and yours may find this to be a welcome change of pace.","Straightforward Euro, easy to learn, pretty fun",False,
B004D3A9AG,4.0,"I'll be honest. This game had a few mis-starts, in that we would think about playing, pull it out, and get a varied way into the instructions before turning to another game like Ticket to Ride, Settlers of Catan, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forbidden-Island/dp/B003D7F4YY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forbidden Island</a>&nbsp;(the household standbys).

I got this thinking it would be different from other games, and then found that by different it seemed pretty confusing and boring.  But, since I got it I was committed to trying it out at least once before committing it to the back of the closet or the bottom of the stack in the game shelf.

Well, I'm glad I was willing to persist.  My wife and I got it out this last Sunday afternoon, made our way slowly through each step and each rule, then began playing. As we did, the logic and the strategy started coming together and it became really fun.

Basically, the goal is to build towers using a variety of different approaches and goals in order to gain the most prestige for your towers at the end of each year (there are four years that make of the game) and then at the end.

The strategy becomes interesting without being too complex (after you get to know the rules), and what I really like is this is a great game for two or more.  We don't play Settlers or other games quite as much because we don't want to invite company over a lot and our daughter is only 2 months old, so has trouble understanding some of the rules of those games.

Anyhow, I totally recommend this.  Expect to be frustrated at the very beginning, and maybe exclaim how all the good reviews were somehow a great conspiracy to get you to waste your time and money.  But then play slowly at first, and you'll start 'getting' it and finding yourself drawn to this game more than even Ticket to Ride or Settlers or other similar games.  I know this is now one of the first games I think about playing, which is probably the best sign of all.  Happy tower building!",Fun and Interesting once you get past the initial confusion,False,
B004D3A9AG,4.0,"Asara was a nominee for German game of the year (the SDJ) for a reason.  It is not because it's a great game for serious gamers.  (If you're a serious gamer you know that you are one, if you don't know what that means then you aren't).

The SDJ awards are NOT about most complex games or even games that serious gamers will love or even like for that matter.  The awards are to make regular non-gaming families more aware of what's out there and to expand the hobby of board gaming.

If you are a serious gamer then Asara is not for you.  (The reviewers bashing this for not being for them aren't being fair to the game.)

Ravensburger is so intent on making it clear that this game is for families that they literally changed the title here on Amazon.  The title is just Asara.  There is no ""family"" in the actual game title.

The problem comes down to the instructions.  For non-serious gamers they are problematic as clearly shown by many reviews.  However, this is typical of many Euro games such as this.  As someone trained in writing I can say with absolute confidence that in fact the majority of instructions for these type of games are horribly written for lay readers.  Asara is simply one of many.  So if you're a family gamer, don't let the badly written instructions confuse you.  Visit the boardgamegeek site and you'll find many reviews that explain the basic rules.  And the rules actuall are pretty basic.

Asara is a worker placement game.  Your ""workers"" are your cards.  Place your workers/cards in the various sections to claim whatever that section offers.  You must follow suit if someone has placed a card before you.  If you can't follow suit then place two cards down.  There are spots for tower pieces, the bank (where you get money), a spot to claim first player slot, and a spot to ""cheat"" and look through and select tower pieces that haven't yet been made available on the board.

Asara is a simple version of the worker placement genre.  Stone Age, a really great game, has more going on and harder to learn.  If you already play Stone Age then this one is probably a step backwards.  But then, Asara is for people who haven't even heard of games like Stone Age.  It's mostly for non-serious gamers.

So the question is, is Asara a good family game?  Yes . . . but with one caveat.  The included instructions make it look as if this game is more complicated than it is.  Don't judge the game by the badly written rules.  If you do then you'll be losing out on literally hundreds of games because so many of them have worse written rules than Asara.

For me, Asara was a bit boring.  But I'm a serious gamer.  If you're not heavily into board gaming, check this one out if it's already caught your eye.  Keep in mind, however, that Asara is only for ten and up.  So if you have younger kids pass this one by.","Ignoring the directions, this one really is for families",False,
B004D3A9AG,4.0,"At first, Asara looks pretty intimidating with several sections of board that creates an octagonal playing field.  Then there are pieces of different shapes and sizes.  And, as if that weren't enough, there is the game and then there's the ""professional"" game.

Let me confess now that we have not yet played the professional game.

Asara is probably more complicated to set up than it is to actually play.  The designers have created a cheat sheet to help with the game set-up.  Once you've worked your way through that, the rest of the rules are fairly straight forward.  The goal is to build a towers.  You can build towers of different colors, and size does matter.  At the end of the game, the tallest and second tallest towers of each color earns bonus points.  But the more towers you have, the better.  And some tower colors are worth more points than others.

So there is strategy involved--build many smaller towers, a few very tall towers, or what have you.  And there is some luck involved as well because you never know what color tower pieces will be easiest to pick up which depends on what buyers have been played and are in your hand.

Sound complicated?  Okay.  It is a little confusing but we went ahead and played the game, following the rules as we understood them.  The next day a quick reread of the rules revealed that we'd been doing a few things incorrectly.  Oops.  But even playing the game incorrectly, we were having fun because there really is just enough strategy and just enough luck to keep the game from being too predictable.

We're already planning our next game night so we can give this game again--that's how much we enjoyed ourselves.  Who knows?  Maybe if we play it and actually follow the rules we'll like it even more.  I'll be back to update my review with our second thoughts once we've had a chance to play it some more.  And definitely, when we play it at the professional level, you can be sure I'll share our thoughts on that variation as well.  I'm really looking forward to it.",We're already looking forward to playing again,False,
B004D3A9AG,5.0,"The basic concept of this game is that you're building towers, and at the end of the game will get points depending on how many you've built, and who has built the tallest of each color. There are other ways to get points too, and that's where the strategy comes in. There are also strategic decisions to be made in terms of when to visit the bank to get more money (to buy more parts to build more towers), when to bribe the officials to get a piece you desperately need, what color tower to build (some cost more to build than others), and so on. If it sounds complicated, well, it is at first. There is definitely a bit of a learning curve. That said, at the end of the first game with my 9 and 12 year old, we got it.

In addition to being fun, there is an educational component, both in devising your winning strategy and in simple things like making change (when you buy tower parts) and calculating your score at the end of each ""year"". Obviously with younger children you can help them with these tasks.

Overall I thought it was a good, engaging game for the all ages (although I wouldn't go younger than 8) and had fun playing it. Set up takes a while, in part because the board is in pieces. I'm tempted to tape it together permanently, but then I wouldn't be able to try the advanced level of game play, so I guess I'll leave it be. It also needs a fair amount of space to play on, but a card table will do.

If you're looking for a fun and unique game for the family that involves a good amount of strategy, check this one out.","A bit of an ordeal to set up the first time, but fun once you get playing",False,
B004D3A9AG,4.0,"Asara's an interesting game that starts with a simple concept: build towers. The towers in question are assemblies of cardboard counters with different colors and sections that you need to put together to make the tallest towers you can. But, it's a bit more complicated than that in the end since it's not simply about building a single tower as big as you can get. It's more about deciding the size and number of towers while managing a limited number of turns and of course other players.

Main Game Mechanic

The game covers four years within which each player gets a number of turns to try to buy tower parts and assemble towers. Turns are based on a set of buyers represented by half-sized playing cards. The ""suits"" are different colored pictures of a figure representing a buyer. By placing a buyer in a slot on the board, you enable yourself to access whatever section of the board (and thus function) it belongs to. For example, if you want to buy the base for a new tower you want to build, you'll place a buyer card in one of the slots adjacent to the tower base ""market"". The first person to place a colored card sets the suit for that market for that year. So, if you place a blue card down, all other players need to place a blue card from their own hand in order to access that market. If you don't have the color you need, you can place two cards of any suit face down in a slot in that market. This effectively adds an additional cost and a layer of strategy to the acquisition of tower parts. The act of buying a part (or paying for some other actions) requires coins (in form of varied denominations of cardboard counters made to look like coins) which you get a small supply of each year (you can obtain more but at the cost of your buyers). You ultimately pay for everything you do. Want tower parts? Buyer + coins. Want to build that tower? Buyer + coins.

A year ends when all players have run out of buyers. Points are tallied based on the number of towers, gold decorations (some parts have them), and whether or not you're the first player to go (something you can use a buyer to take for yourself). The parts markets are restocked, buyers are collected, shuffled and redistributed, and you get another allocation of ""coins"".

After the fourth year, points are awarded based on who has the tallest and second tallest tower of a particular color (parts for each color vary in price so the higher priced parts result in higher point awards in the end) as well as who has the tallest overall tower and the most towers total.

Potential for Deep Gameplay

At first, the game seems pretty straight forward, you build towers, you can find plenty of parts and there are ways to get more of just about anything (need more coins, use a buyer to ""buy"" coins). But, in the end, the combination of a set number of buys and a set number of coins required to get the parts and build the towers you want to build creates just enough competition and limits resources enough to make things challenging. Then you start to realize there are more competitive strategies you can start trying to get what you need and make life harder for the competition. I won't go into detail since half the fun is realizing it after playing a game or two.

Worth Getting?

In the end, the ""family"" game moniker speaks to the demographic. This game is about having a great time playing something that isn't too complicated and doesn't take a lot of time (once you know what you're doing and if everyone's quick, you can probably crank through a game in 30-40 minutes...but why rush? :) ). There's enough to give you something to do beyond just following the rules and getting to the end of the game. Taking advantage of turn order and resource limitations, you can make your life a bit easier and everyone else's harder. And, with the various ways to earn points, in particular at the end of the game, there's enough leeway to keep the game from becoming too competitive.

If you're looking for a nice game that's well done (the only down side in my mind is that the instructions can be a bit confusing in places and some major aspects of scoring in the end game are represented as a couple of bullet points amidst a lot of other text), this is definitely worth the buy. It's not crazy involved or complicated as a game like Android would be but still has enough depth so the game isn't too simple with a limited amount of randomness.","Simple concept, potential for deep gameplay",False,
B004D3A9AG,4.0,"This game involves building towers. There are 4 rounds in the game. Scoring takes place after each round and then a final scoring takes
place at the very end. Scoring in each round depends on points you score for tower pieces as you construct towers. To construct the
towers, you need to dispatch cards which are called buyers. Depending on which marketplace you place the card on (there are 4 areas), you can buy 4 types of tower pieces - Tower bases, middle sections, window sections and the turret section. There are different color pieces of the tower sections to choose from. In each round, each tower gets a point plus a bonus points for every tower section with a gold glint. The final scoring at the end of round 4 (or age 4 as per the game) awards points to the highest and second highest tower in each color category (towers can be of 5 different colors). White scores the max points and brown the lowest. The manual talks about the scoring of each color for the highest/second highest tower in that color. The tallest tower and second tallest tower overall (across all colors) scores some bonus points. The largest and second largest number of towers (across all colors) scores bonus points as well. There is a professional version (read advanced) of the game which when I read up on did not seem all that much extra fun to me, so I just stuck with the basic game. The professional or so called advanced game introduces an extra set of tiles with open tower windows with a light shining from the window. For playing this version of the game, you have to flip the 2 triangles that make up the board to use the other side. You can get options here to discard buyer cards and get more buyer cards based on paying certain amount of money. You can also buy these shining open window tower sections. The open shining window sections go on top of existing closed window sections of the towers (of the same color)you have built. This can help in tight games where there is a tie.

After I played this game, I went back and played Carcassone/Ticket to Ride/ Dominion and it did not compare to the same thrill. I know I am comparing different categories of games but still you get my drift. If you like constructing things, in this case towers, you will like the game. There is a little strategy that can be employed but may not be as involved as other strategy games. The idea is to build throughout keeping the final age scoring in mind but also play to have more towers (during the first three ages)because you get a point per tower in each age. Building taller and taller towers does not help you in the first three ages since you get one point per tower, short or tall. However the tall towers come in handy at the end of round 4. Also cards have different suit colors and with the exception of one place on the board, you have to place cards of the same color as the color the first player who played that area decided to play. This can spawn some strategy in deciding on how you want to occupy the board. Minor quibble is that the money coins are cheap cardboard. The publishers could have provided metal tokens or coins like in dominion prosperity. The cardboard money can easily wear and makes an otherwise well designed game to to seem a little cheap. One other point that was evident was the lack of interaction between the players or reaction-action between players that is missing in this game. Everyone is building their towers but there is no direct way of trying to stop someone from achieving a fixed goal like trying to block someone's route in ticket to ride or giving someone a curse card in dominion. Being able to sabotage someone to have a disadvantage is fun which does not happen here. Overall I thought this is a decent enough game but not a great game that will rock the boardgaming world.",Decent enough game,False,
B004D3A9AG,4.0,"I really enjoy games of all sorts, and my family has quite the collection of board games. On average, I'd say we purchase 3-4 new games a year, and we're always looking for new, fun games to try. On the surface, this game doesn't look like one I would normally go for, but as I had the opportunity to recieve a free copy of this game to try, I immediately went for it. Now that I had the opportunity to play it a couple of times with my family, here's what each member of my family thought of it:

Kayla (12): It's OK, I guess. It seems like there are lots of rules to learn.

Wesley (10): This is a fun game! I want to try the advanced version, now! (Wesley won both games, which definitely colors his opinion.)

Sue (40): The game is more fun than I thought it would be, but I never would have played it if I had to learn it by myself. There's enough to learn that I am glad I had someone (that would be me!) to sit and teach it to me. Now that I've played it a few times, I can see new ways to strategize in future games.

As for myself, I knew the other members of my family would not have the patience to learn this game along with me, so I had to do a run-through by myself to get the hang of it (I have to do this with most any new game I purchase). The directions are easy enough to read, and the insturctions and pictures for setting the game up are colorful and easy to follow. There ARE a lot of directions, but not as many as you first think, as the majority of the pages in the instruction booklet comprise directions printed in numerous foriegn languages, so you really only needing to read about three pages.

There are various levels of strategy to the game, and premption is a big part of things. You can choose to play passively, or aggressively. by this I mean that you can focus solely on achieving your goal, or you can divert some of your resources to preventing others from achieving their own goals. Unlike some other games where building is the objective, there really is no cooperative aspect to this game - no trading or selling things to one another or joint actions taking place. All actions are completed by each player, by him- or herself. The game basically plays in fours rounds, and althought there is some small scoring done each round, most of the scores do not add up to much until the very end of the game. The game requires little to no interaction between players, so it is definitely what I would call a ""quiet game.""

On the box, the game time indicates a one-hour play experience, but it took us closer to two hours the first time, and close to 90 minutes the second time around. I think this time will drop as we continue to become more familiar with the game, though. Now, as we try out the advanced version of the game, the game play time will probably creep up, again.

Everything that came with the game was of very high quality, which seems to be the norm for games that originate in Europe. All of the game pieces are made from thick, high-quality cardboard and are covered with beautiful, glossy illustrations on both the front and back. Very impressive! Game tokens and counters are crafted from wood.

The game is a four-player game, and does not allow for more players than this. Ideally, I think a three-player game would be the most fun and take just the right amount of time, while a two-player game may be too short and predictable.

Overall, I found this game to be a fun addition to my games collection, and I would recommend it to others who enjoy learning new board games.","Not a game I would have purchased at first glance, but there's definitely some fun to be had, here!",False,

My only complaint is that the way they are cut, it doesn't come apart that easily, and some of the pieces don't fit back together as easily as I would have liked, so my daughter gets a little frustrated at times. But I do like the size - i wanted a 40-50 piece puzzle that wasn't too small or two big.

She LOVES this Melissa & Doug Mermaid puzzle due to the subject matter, colors and image. I (if you are interested in the parent's opinion) am a little disappointed personally in the M&D wooden puzzles, as this one and the Ballerina one we purchased, give her some difficulty and angst when pulling the pieces apart to break down the puzzle when beginning; and, often times she gets somewhat frustrated and cranky because she knows a piece goes where she is trying to place it, it's just really difficult to get it to snap in the multiple pieces surrounding it. She doesn't seem to have any 'super tight fit' issues with her Princess Castle & Unicorn M&D puzzle strangely. All in all, she loves the scenes and colors of the M&D puzzles and she really has no problem with her minor frustrations. I just don't like to see her exhibit unnecessary 'puzzle rage,' but perhaps this too is a good lesson and experience for little ones in learning how to tame one's 'hot headedness' at an early age.","Really Cute, but ""Sticky""",True,3

The pirate ship one is surprisingly, and embarrassingly, hard. I hope if anyone reading this who has the pirate ship one can relate. I chose these other three because of their distinct coloring and the space between like objects, etc so it would be something they won't get frustrated with. But we do still love the pirate ship one as well. The pictures are really nice and don't seem to wear off. The pieces fit together nicely. They are all-around a great pick if your kids like puzzles.

By blind pack, it means you don't know who you get until you open the pack.  There are three classifications for rarity.  There are common figures, uncommon, and rare.

The figures that are common:
1) 11th Doctor
2) Silent

Uncommon Figures:
1) Dalek: The Supreme
2) Cyberleader
3) Roman Auton
4) Vampire
5) Amy Pond (in ""normal"" clothes).
6) Rory Williams

Rare Figures:
1) River Song
2) Amy Pond (in Police Uniform).

My personal experience and views:

I bought the Weeping Angel pack at Target recently.  That was my first experience with these.  I was bummed to learn the pack only had a Weeping Angel and not the 11th Doctor or Amy Pond on the cover.  I found out about these blind packs on Amazon and ordered one just for the heck of it.  I got the rare Amy Pond in Police Uniform.  VERY HAPPY ABOUT IT!

WIth these, they are so interesting to look at b/c of color and design, but there are eyes at the tops of each of them, showing which 'end is up' so to speak. They are darling and perfect. The only thing I worry about is the paint possibly wearing off with so much use, so I may just put a clear glaze over them so they last forever.

B006HDF32Y,5.0,"I purchased this for my daughter and gave it to her for Christmas (along with Jake's pirate ship).
She kept taking all the paper towels off the roll so she could have a telescope. So I thought she needed something a little better. She LOVES it. She's a very girly girl, but she loves Jake and the Never Land pirates. She will be in a princess dress, wearing the pirate bandana, holding the treasure map and looking throughout the house for treasure. The map is thin paper and she did rip it a little the very first day. I taped it and it hasn't ripped since. If your kid likes to play with the map, and you're able to, consider laminating it. The only thing I don't like about this set, is when you look through the telescope, Captain Hooks image is always there. It would be nice if he only appeared when you press the button. As others have noted, the telescope doesn't magnify, but I wasn't expecting it to and my child doesn't care about that function anyways.

B0076O6G60,5.0,"My son is 18 months old and LOVES this tool set.  He often ""helps"" me in the garage/wood shop so I have been looking around for a quality option for him to work with.  He can manipulate the pieces in multiple ways so I think he will be able to play with this for a while.  I think this will work until he is old enough to have small versions of real tools available at Lowes and the like.  This will let him learn in a safe manner how the tools and hardware work together.  A child under three should always be supervised with this sort of tow because it would be possible (though difficult) to choke on one of the smaller pieces.

- There are enough peices for a toddler to enjoy without being overwhelmed by too much going on.
- There are no artificial noises or such, just a good, solid toy for open ended play.

2 ""nails"" to pound or remove with the hammer's claw, plastic
2 screws to work with the flat head screw driver, plastic
2 nuts to manipulate with the wrench and fit on the screws, plastic

You definitely don't get enough pieces with the toolbox to build many things, if you have a younger toddler thats probably ok but for older preschoolers you might want to supplement with one of their builder kits.

It's a very nicely made tool box, good size for my two year old, and the tools are a good size and seem good quality (I haven't given it to her yet). As others have mentioned, there are two bolts that are plastic. Everything else is wood. I don't mind, and I'm sure the plastic makes them usable. I really like the vibrant colors, and I am a fan of Hape toys in general. I do wish it came with more screws and nails (it includes two each), which brings me to my issue with the order... the product page when I bought it clearly said it's a 30 piece set, and it's not. There are 14 pieces in the box, and the box clearly says there are 14 pieces. I don't know where the 30 comes from - even if you counted the toolbox itself as 6 pieces (counting each side, the bottom, and the handle, that would still only be 20, and still misleading.

B008RU8GC4,5.0,"ThinkFun has again lived up to its name, creating a game to make learning sight words fun! Essential to learning to read, sight words are the most frequently used words in the English language. Unlike other words, they often can't be sounded out phonetically and have to be learned through visual memory, which can be frustrating to kids.  Just bring out the captivating Zinger device that reveals two word tiles per turn as players race to cover their Bingo-like Zingo card first. Some of the word spaces on the cards have graphics corresponding to the word--an ""x"" marks the spot for ""here,"" a downward arrow points ""in,"" a speech bubble surrounds ""said,"" or a little figure waves for ""me."" Most of the squares have colorful patterns of stripes, checks and shapes to pair with the sight words, adding some pizazz to these critical words for reading. My little testers loved the game and wanted to play multiple rounds calling out words, ""I found a 'me',"" and even read the words as they reloaded the Zinger, ""Can I put 'said' in the bottom?"" Zingo! Sight Words engages Pre-K to 1st graders in such a fast paced game that they want to keep playing, becoming more proficient readers with each round. I love when kids are having such fun they have no idea how much they are learning!",Essential Learning Made Fun!,False,
B008RU8GC4,5.0,"My kids ages 7 and 5 boys, both enjoyed playing Zingo Sight Words.  The game is fast paced and exciting, they aren't even aware they are learning. ;) As we all know sight words are key in establishing reading fluency - this game makes it fun, more fun than flash cards for sure.

It would've made learning sight words more fun and engaging! The game is perfect for Kindergarten and first grade students that have been introduced to sight words.

I do wish there were more sight words at a harder level. Perhaps the company could come out with a higher level sight word list. Thanks Think Fun for another educational and fun game!!!",Great for school,False,
B008RU8GC4,5.0,"I really love Think Fun's games.  Many I have purchased, and some I have been blessed to get for the gratis so that I can share my ever so humble opinion.  This was one of them.  Gee, twist my arm!
I was super dooper excited to hear that Zingo now has a Sight Word version.  I had been trying to figure out what other concepts we could finagle out of the Zingo world.  In our game arsenal we've got the traditional, the numbers (1, 2, 3) , and the travel versions of Zingo.  There are Spanish and Hebrew versions as well, but we haven't gone that route.  I bring them to and from school on a daily basis.
When Sight Word Zingo came in the mail, Mudge was eager to get our first game going.  Though the boards themselves are a little visually busy, the concept is the same.  Match the word tiles to its board counterpart.  It still has the trademark Zinger, the Zingo slider with slots for the popping in unused tiles (great for fine motor development and wrist rotation).  The 72 tiles themselves are double-sided with 24 frequently used words from the Dolch list.
As Mudge is only in preschool, he did not know the words but could match the tiles by the letters.  He loved trying to figure it out.  His persistence and memory began to pay off towards the end as he recognized the groups of letters like  and, we and me.  This has proven to be a great starter game to get new readers recognizing letter combinations as words.  It is also a great review game for up to first and second graders.  Many of the children I know have requested me to bring it in for bus arrival time or indoor recess.  For children with special needs, one of my teachers even thought of using it towards her Alternate Assessments, as many of them need to identify sight words.
When our game was done, I asked Mudge his favorite part to which he answered, ""I like the matching Mommy.""  Was there anything you didn't like?  ""Well, Mommy, the red side was very difficult"".  Did you not like it?  ""Oh no.  I liked it, it was just difficult.""
Finding the just right challenge can be difficult sometimes.  But Think Fun has found another winner again for the early learners.  Sight Words Zingo is another great addition to the home and school family.  For around $20, Zingo Sight Words will happily engage young readers while helping them learn.",Great for the early reader arsenal!,False,
B008RU8GC4,5.0,"I am currently homeschooling my 4 year old. We are doing Pre-K right now and learning sight words. This game is a perfect addition to schooling and the big plus? My 4 year old LOVES it. You simply load up the Zingo! Sight Words container with all the sight words, not difficult but a bit time consuming. We asked our Princess a few times to be careful no to spill the words out.

Zingo! Sight Words is played like the traditional Bingo game, you match the words to the words on your card. Of course, we say all the words that are drawn out loud and have our Princess repeat the words. In this way we can reinforce the way the word looks and sounds in her mind. I feel that if we play this game enough with her she will be learning her sight words even more quickly than just during school time.

Pros:

1) fun way to learn sight words. It is always good for us to take school work out of the equation,  and just make it fun!

2) the format is easy and keeps the game compact and neat. We have the traditional zing as well, and this is great. If you get a card you don't need, simply slip it back into the dispenser using the sits on the top.

3) the game is 100% words,  so kids learn what the sight words are. There are some tiny symbols, but not really pictures.

Cons:

Really not ideal. It would get two thumbs up and a 5 star rating if there was a way to clip that top piece on.

B008RU8GC4,5.0,"At the time of this review I taught ""regular"" first grade students.  My students were on various levels (Pre-K through 2nd) when it came to reading.  One of the most difficult tasks of teaching can be making learning fun.  I found this game on Amazon and thought it might be a good addition to my small group teaching time (after a structured lesson).  The result?  ALL of my students fell in love with this game.  They would often ask to play it during their small group reading time if we had time left at the end of the lesson.  There are two sides to each card; however, even my students who were below grade level could use the ""harder"" side of the card.  The key part of this is to have the students read the word (or try to read the word) before getting the word chip.  Even though they are sight words I found it essential to help the student try to figure out the word to ensure success.  Rather than only get three in a row I often played the game where the entire card had to be filled.  At the end of the game I would always reward the students with a pencil, eraser, ticket, etc... whether or not they won.  That avoided anybody feeling like they lost.  It didn't ever delete the motivation to play because each student still wanted to win.

B008RU8GC4,5.0,"I have been seeing quite a bit of sliding words games for children to help them read and acquire language and I have to say I really like that.  From what I have read, tools like Zingo have been a great addition to a children's comprehension in reading and apprehension of sight words and Brooke seems to have such fun with the sliding doors.  Zingo is a classic Bingo-style game where kids have the chance to learn up to 75 sight words while playing a brilliant and fun card game to give their reading ability a positive boost.  While you can play with another child (or up to six) or an adult, Zingo is also a game you can play independently which I really love, too.  Sight words can be a source of frustration for new readers who are not able to sound out the words and the Zingo! Sight Words game does a great job in word recognition and making the process of learning sight words fun.  I can also see where reluctant readers have the option to practice and learn on their own and can move up to a group setting at a later time.  The Zingo! Sight Words game includes 72 Zingo! sight words tiles, six double-sided Zingo! cards, Zingo! Zinger card dispenser, instructions, and a learning guide.  One awesome thing about the Zingo! game is that it offers visual cues to help the player recognize words.  Visual memory is often the key to learning sight words for children which is usually where that source of frustration comes in among early readers.  Learning sight words is considered one of the keys of language fluency and I think the Zingo! word game does an excellent job of exposing and unlocking the secret of the English language to new and emergent readers.

B008RU8GC4,5.0,"Sight Words: Evidence that English is REALLY Hard

Some words don't have any logic to them.  Those always made me mad but I have memorized them.  To my dismay, my kids have not.  I now know that they are called sight words.  Said is sed not sade.  Who is hoo and not wa hoe.  Now that I understand what sight words are, I feel good that I get to play Zingo! Sight Words with Number 2 Son who is learning how to read now and he's pretty good at it.  However, since sight words have little logic to them and this new Zingo game is good news indeed!  That is, because I can fairly say with confidence having studied more than three other languages, English is a really is a tough language to learn.  If kids or immigrants have a hard time learning to read English, it's not their fault.  Blame Brittania.

We have owned and played&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ThinkFun-Zingo/dp/B00006408Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ThinkFun Zingo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ThinkFun-Zingo-1-2-3/dp/B0032UKTXI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ThinkFun Zingo 1-2-3</a>&nbsp;possibly hundreds of times (no kidding, Number 2 is crazy about Zingo) but for Zingo! Sight Words, I decided to consult an expert because I honestly don't know how kids are taught sight words.

 ""Oh, I love Zingo,"" said Alison Berkley, one of my favorite education experts who is a true toy lover.  She owns many bingo games and but to Alison, Zingo! Sight Words really stands out. ""It's a great game for kids because they like the tile things, [they] like clicking it back and forth!  It's really cool,"" she said.  ""They like shoving the tiles back and forth when they're done. The boards are really colorful and engaging.""

Alison really likes that the boards have some sort of graphic to help kids distinguish between the words, especially when they look similar to each other.  (ie. there or three)  You might be wondering how they confused they could become but I've been watching my children closely and not only do they get confused but so do I!  Alison is right, the different images that ThinkFun creates for the words do help the children get used to the differences.  But then that worried me a little?  Is that a good thing? Shouldn't they be reading those words?

 Matching Words Requires Reading Words But Images Can Help

Alison said that we use images to teach vocabulary.  ""You hold up a cup and you say cup.  When you're teaching new words, that's always kind of what we do,"" Alison explained.  ""You're teaching them the meaning of that word and if it's concrete, like a number, you can show it.""

Then Alison showed me what the clear difference was from Zingo! Sight Words and other Bingo Vocab games.  ""The other Bingos that I have have big pictures and tiny little letters on the tile boards as well as the tiles.  So there... they're just matching pictures,"" she said.  But for Zingo! Sight Words, it's different. ""You are asking them to read the word on the tile and then look at their board, so they are reading first and then matching second.""

 Finding New Ways to Learn?

You are right Alison.  My kids ARE reading first and matching second, I LOVE THAT!!!!  Goodness, is there a Zingo! SAT Verbal Game?  I'm serious!  Wouldn't that be effective?  I am really trying to be more open-minded about learning reading and improving vocabulary.  I even found this book that used cartoons to help expand one's SAT Vocab list.  Wish I had this book back then!  ThinkFun, as usual, is doing something wildly creative with fun and learning and to kids,...well, I think all they see is the fun.  (which is why they learn it so fast!)

 Make it Work for Your Family

Speaking of fun, this game is really a blast, especially for the little ones.  However, it can be more fun for the ones who might have a winner-loser anxiety IF you take turns and not let it be competitive.  (One person uses the Zinger at a time, if you have the word and matching tile, keep it, if not, give it out or push it back into the Zinger.)  Alternatively, you can be like Number 1 Son and make it much harder.  Just use more cards per game!  You can play against a little one if you use two cards and he uses just one. Use post it notes to cover up some words if you only want to use half a card.  There are lots of tiles in the Zinger so one adult and one kid can play this way without the adult falling asleep on the child because they purposely went slower to give the child a bit of a chance.

Lastly, as those of us in New York and New Jersey and other affected areas deal with the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, I think back to those first days where many of us suffered from what might be called Cabin Fever.  To be honest, I don't know if it was Cabin Fever that my family suffered.  Looking out of the window was frightening and we weren't exactly ""bored.""  Each time we turned on the T.V., (because we were lucky that we never lost power) the news grew worse and worse.  And I have to say that while this family had SO MANY GAMES here (can't hide this fact), the best games for us at the time had to be the ones that made you laugh.  We really needed to laugh.  This game helped us entertain each other.  Sure this is a tool to increase sight word recognition and it is really good at that but you can't underestimate the fun factor.  It's just as strong here and that is Zingo's gift.",Learning is Easy When It's Fun!,False,3.0

The workmanship and quality is far superior to any plastic marble run they had in the past (of which many pieces have been long lost or broken).  I like that it's a natural wood toy that has the potential to become an heirloom.  It also comes packaged in a large, sturdy box with a handle and compartments that have pictures indicating where each piece should go, making organization, storage, and the different parts easier to track.  No need to buy a separate storage bin!

The only constructive feedback that I have is that I wish it came with more, because with how big and nice the box is, it looks like there should be more pieces included.  Then again, maybe that was done on purpose so that families are left hungry for more in order to get the other kits the company makes to complement this set...

That's not to say the toy isn't worth it.  This marble run is pricier than the plastic ones on the market for a good reason.  I already know this set will get a ton more mileage than the other one we had.  If my sons take good care of it, I can already see them passing this on to their own kids.

B00AX8V3OQ,5.0,"I was so glad I found this brand of marble maze. We have bought a few plastic versions but they have all been flimsy and not very engaging.

This marble maze series made by Hape is tremendous. We have had so much fun building with this. Not only does each set come with a book and great step by step directions with photos for making multiple mazes the color coded-functionality of the transporting blocks help kids work out marble flow and direction when building on their own. Some blocks allow marbles to flow one or two directions or alternating directions as well as some being travel though pieces while others are drop into pieces.

Although the wood pieces fit together they do not lock so it can be knocked over which may be an issue for younger children who get really excited like my four year old grandson but my seven year old son builds and maintains his mazes with no problems.

It also comes with a bag full or marbles so never having a marble should never be an issue. We use a funnel and just load the maze up and it can have a marble flow continuously for as long as someone collects and loads.

B00FZM436A,5.0,"This is a figure line, either you'll love it ot hate it. In my case, I passed on this figure early on. But it grew on me after I purchased Flash Total Hero. I was please wish his design and I ended up taking a chance on Batman Total Hero. PROS: 1) Good sculpt. Face sculpt is solid. 2) Paint applications - Grey and Black (New 52 costume inspired) with nice gold utility belt. 4) Articulation is good. 5) Comes with a CLOTH CAPE! Finally, not a plastic molded cape! 6) ACCESSORIES: Comes with Grappling Gun and 2 Batarangs. CONS: 1) PAINT - I looked through 5 different figures because paint is sloppy where the mask meets the face. 2) Also saw on most figures that the black around his neck would have scuff marks. It's a molded plastic so you can't wipe off. 3) ARTICULATION: The only joint I don't like are the knee caps. They an eye sore when legs are bent and viewed from a side angle. NOTE: This is a figure for a mid-level collector. Not too kiddy and not highly detailed. It's a good middle grade if you're on a budget or just new to collecting. OVERALL: Looks really good displayed and no need to peg onto a base. Highly recommended if you're in the market for a stylized Batman figure. Retail: $9.99",Stylized Batman. Best individual figure of the line so far.,False,3
B00FZM436A,5.0,"The image shown is actually the Batman from Wave 1 of the Total Heroes line but ""DETECTIVE BATMAN"" is a slight variant, that in my opinion, is better than the Wave 1 Batman. Detective Batman has all the same points of articulation as Wave 1 Batman but there are a few key differences. The utility belt and the head on Detective Batman are totally different. The head features smaller ears similar to the Jim Lee Batman. The utility belt is similar to the Batman of the late 70's, 80's and early to mid 90's, The colors scheme of Detective Batman also features blue instead of black. Blue cape and cowl, blue gloves and boots, and blue trunks below the waist line. Wave 1 Batman came with a grapnel gun and 2 batarangs while Detective Batman comes with handcuffs and two bat grenades. The bat symbol on Detective Batman is also larger on the chest than Wave 1 Batman.
Its not a major overhaul but if you are a fan of the color scheme and style of Jim Lee or the Batman of the 80's and early/mid 90's then Detective Batman is a very cool variant and one you shouldnt pass up.",DETECTIVE BATMAN,True,4

I have every Blizzard figure so far and they really do vary in quality, but never in Beauty!

The Funko figures are very different from the standard DC unlimited figures. Kind of a cutesy-minimalist....in the best way possible! They won't give you too much hassle when trying to display them.

B00HLBDYZO,5.0,"SH Figuarts version of Minako Aina the other blue eyed blonde sailor scout, Sailor Venus is superb. She has the same excellent articulation and paint apps found on the other sailor scouts mainly in a nice light orange motif. Her hair is a wonderful flowing and layered sculpt. With some motion to it achieved via separate articulation to the two inner side pieces. making it a bit fuller than expected. The only articulation flaw is the lack of a bicep swivel which is standard on the sailor scout and love live figures sadly. The thiness of the arms I guess prevents it.

Mina comes with a good selection of accessories. Not quite as much as Sailor Moon, but a nice grouping. She includes a nice figureof Artemis, the White Cat. he has a head swivel. A nice selection of hands including one holding her signature Sailor V disguise. Three extra faces and one replacement hair front piece that includes the Sailor V mask attached so it can be worn over any face. She also has the standard heart shaped sailor moon stand. Unfortunately it does not work as well with her as it does with the others. She runs into the same issue that a few of the Love Live figures have. The Stand arms must swing out and back at a diagonal, with a pivoting waist clamp. The bulk of the clamp and stand arm prevents her hair from laying flat on her back and limits her head movement forcing her to look down. Bandai finally figured out a better stand option for the long haired female figures with Shampoo from Ranma 1/2. But Sailor Venus predates that by awhile. Replacing the hinged clamp piece with a straight right angle clamp from a Tamashii Stage 4 set might help.

If you are collecting Sailor Scouts she is a must have.",A nicely articulated Sailor Scout,True,

B00HLBDYZO,4.0,"these figures are stunning and beautiful.

the attention to detail and their versatility is astonishing.

Unfortunately they must be handled with care.  These are not ideal to be played with like real actionfigures, as im sure there intended pupose is for display only.  the interchangeable pieces come off almost too easily.  I got them for my daughters to play with, despite my concerns on purchase.  Sailor moons pigtails fall out all the time, and we can't find her face and bangs right now.  Venus's flowing locks snapped off (in a way they cannot be put back on) almost immediately.  Tuxedo mask is the sturdiest of the three we have, though his legs and head have to be put back on regularly as well.  I'm pretty sure any day now one of the tiny tiny tiny little pegs that hold on one of these fragile limb are going to snap so that we can reattach limbs.

Just wish they were sturdier, because the girls simply adore them.  (i secretly do too,) super cool, if they weren meant as actual toys.

- The figure is SOLID. No wiggles (like mercury, mars or moon). She stands up STRAIGHT and her legs are on point.
- NO defects in this one that I have seen. Her leg looks SLIGHTLY off but it doesn't affect the figure at all!
- The interchangeable faces are really well done. They fit in perfectly, and have no issues getting them out (unlike moon).
-  Her stand is the BEST stand to date. It's really secure, and would take a lot to break it. It holds her in place perfectly and doesn't  wiggle her around after she is on it.
- The paint job is perfect. No smudges, no marks, nothing. Just solid color.
- Artemis being added is a perfect addition! It's the same cast as Luna, which is to be expected.
- The hair part with her Sailor V mask is a great addition! I love that they added that!

B00HLBDYZO,5.0,Sailor Venus is by far the best figure released yet. There's no joint or paint application problems on her (unlike the other scouts I have purchased).

B00HLPJ8PU,5.0,"We like this set because it includes a variety of interesting shapes for building along with the standard triangles and squares in the set, so it lets kids be quite creative in their designs. It comes with pictoral instructions to make a bunny, owl, bat, squirrel, butterfly, skunk, duck, turtle, and frog.

This set contains:

11 squares
2 trapezoids
2 diamonds
2 sectors (quarter circles)
2 super sectors (quarter annulus)
1 super arch (3 square rectangle bridge)
2 arches (bridges one square)
2 mini arches (half size arch)
2 hexagons
2 isosceles triangles
16 triangles
3 rectangles (2 connected squares)

For kids learning shapes, there are enough pieces in this set to make additional 2D shapes like a semi circle, large semi circle, six pointed star, cross, long parallogram and to fill in the trapezoid, hexagon, or diamond with triangles. 3D shapes include a cube, block, triangular and square pyramids, quarter cylinder, and large quarter cylinder.

B00IJA42K2,5.0,"Oh my gosh where to begin?!  The photo really doesn't do this doll justice -- she's gorgeous -- and she's a minor character, but a fan favorite, and they really knocked it out of Equestria when this doll was made.  First off, her hair is soft, silky, and thick.  None of the usual styling goop thing that's used on dolls.  Her outfit is beautiful!  Glittery gold, and the glitter DOES NOT COME OFF.  Bonus for us mommies who have resigned ourselves to living with glitter-encrusted furniture due to little girls' dolls and toys.  The outfit has two velcro places so the doll can get dressed/undressed; the part at her neck is tiny, so if you're not careful, it looks like it might tear off eventually, but the other part closes the torso part of her outfit, so even if the neck part rips, the outfit is still okay.  Her shoes have a little ""buckle"" at the ankle strap, which is a little tricky for my 3-year old to manage, but she can do it herself...with lots of tries.  I'm sure a 5 year old could do it easily.  The doll will stand on her own (wearing the shoes) with some balancing, since her hair is so thick. The cello (?) is one-sided, and just molded plastic, but has great detail, and the bow is the same.  Both are constructed nicely, they seem pretty durable.  Octavia can hold the bow in one hand, it has a space for her hand to slip through, but we've yet to figure out the angle to make it look like she's playing her instrument (comes out looking like she's wielding a sword).  The pony is made of stiffer, harder plastic than the ones sold individually in stores.  The pony's head can move from side to side, and her hair is soft and silky.  The brush is standard for all the EQGs, and so is the card.  Very satisfied with this purchase.",Octavia rocks!,False,15.0

This doll is really fun because she comes with her cello. The pony is fun as well and can only be purchased in this set (this is the real reason we bought the doll). We have collected almost all the ponies and we love that this is one of the background characters that you see pretty often in the show. If I can get picky about it, I would say the two things that slightly bothered me was that she has pony ears (which never occurs in the movie, Rainbow Rocks) and also the cello is not of accurate size in comparison to the doll. It's like half-way between a cello and a viola, so I'm really just confused on what kind of stringed instrument this is.

All though the outfit isn't as detailed and accurate as my Applejack, it fits the character's classical music performer style. Her hair is also styled to be very close to Octavia's actual hair in the movie, though the pink stripes were added. The pony the comes with her is lovely as well, with a cute little bowtie like the background character in the show does.

I love how this one game set is actually six games in one.  Everything is stored in one box and there is no reading required, other than initial instructions.  The pieces are small, kid-sized and all very colorful.  That may be the only drawback is that when I play with my daughter, I feel like the pieces are small for my big hands - but they are perfect for her hands.  I'd recommend this set for any Frozen fan even if they already own the games separately.  Even my boys enjoy playing the games.  I like that everything stores nicely in the box and that I can grab this game and have it actually be six games!

B00KZM538M,5.0,"This is adorable. I purchased for my girls who just turned 4 and just turned 6. We play a game almost every day so I am always looking to add to our collection. My girls love everything frozen so I just had to get this and give it a try. For the price you really can't go wrong for 6 games. It was a great choice and a great purchase. The games included are a great collection that was well thought out. The graphics are awesome. My kindergartener plays zingo in school but loves the frozen bingo at home. Also the crazy 8s game is easier for my preschooler to play than other crazy 8s card games. This Reminds me more of uno. Instead of having to differentiate a spade from a club the different suits are different colors. Also the different numbers all have the same picture. The 8s are Olaf etc. so this crazy 8s game is much easier and more fun for my preschooler. It has quickly become
One of the most popular picks. I would like to order a second deck of just the crazy 8 game but just can't find it by itself. They have enjoyed the 4 in a row game as well. They enjoy spinning a spinner then choosing either a character to match or a shape that matches depending on what they spin. So if they spin a diamond shape there is a diamond shape with each of the different characters on it so they have a choice. The same with a character. If they spin and it lands on Elsa they have a choice which Elsa they pick. Usually the game ends in a draw. My kids also love memory. It is one of the few games my 4 year old can beat the 6 year old. The quality is good. We actually have the frozen memory match game and these cards are from that same game. If you buy a bingo game the quality is going to be about the same. This bingo is a great first bingo game. The girls take turns drawing a card then look on their bingo cards to see if that image is one they have on their cards. So no reading required and a bingo that even young children can play. The same deck of cards is for both go fish and crazy 8s. The cards are good quality. We played both games with them but since they are the same cards for two different games it is easy for young kids to get confused. We will just use the cards to play crazy 8s and continue using the jumbo go fish card deck we have. Great addition to our game collection and worth the money.",This is adorable.

B00KZM538M,4.0,My daughter loves this game set!!! She wants to play it daily. The reason it lost a star is because there aren't enough chips for bingo and also the bingo cards weren't very creative.

When she said she wanted ""Mermaid Dora"", I was worried I would find some crazy expensive doll she would play with twice. Thankfully, I found this for under $10. WIN! She actually loves it a lot. I don't think it is terribly well made, but it seems to be holding up just fine with semi rough play. She has pretty much turned into a bathtub toy and I expect her to last for quite a bit longer. The little shell thing tends to not want to snap shut easily, but since she is a little older (6) and can manipulate things better than younger kiddos, it hasn't been a problem for her, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under the age of 4 unless you don't care if they use the shell thing or not.

The set was simple for my kid to build, and she liked how this set is like a house - there's even a little bed on the second floor.  One thing in particular that the kids thought was incredibly funny is that this set comes with a tiny bathroom with toilet and lid.  Needless to say, apparently our little figure learned the hard way that you shouldn't eat a sundae, two ice cream cones, and a popsicle all in one sitting.

B00ND5ZWKC,4.0,"This is a pretty great entry in the Combiner Wars line and one of the few unique Magnus figures to come out in a long time that wasn't just a slight repaint of Optimus with or without a slightly different trailer attached. His vehicle cab looks a bit small in his alt mode, but since it doesn't detach from the trailer, it's not noticeable once he changes into a large robot mode. His upper body converts and pegs into place very nice and smooth, but his legs are a bit tricky with several different spots for the pegs to get stuck or misaligned. His feet are on a stiff swing-arm sort of joint that is surprisingly sturdy, but offers little articulation and poseability. His 2 blasters and shoulder rocket pods combine into a large, albeit, unusual hammer weapon (reminiscent of his Prime/Beast Hunters weapons). The major complaint I have about this figure is his hands. Instead of utilizing the standard 5mm peg holes seen on almost every Transformer of the last 20 years, he has these pitiful hinge joints in his knuckles that offer almost zero grip on his weapons and require constant fiddling to keep them held firmly in place. Despite this annoying flaw, he's an all around really nice figure and a great addition to any larger sized collection. As far as the Minimus figure? He's just sort of there. Not a micron, a targetmaster, or a headmaster, he doesn't really serve much purpose at all...","Almost hits every mark, but one very annoying flaw.",False,
B00ND5ZWKC,4.0,"I have been collecting on and off for quite some time. This was one of the figures that had to be bought as the Masterpiece Edition was out of my price range. I am happy with the size and stature of this figure as I have it displayed with Leader Class Jetfire and Masterpiece Optimus Prime.

Pros:
-Stature, size, presence, all are taken into account with height and proportions
-Transformation is direct and fairly enjoyable. I was able to transform figure right out of box without looking at directions.
-Design with attached cab works and kibble is acceptable for figure being very hollow
-The figure holds together fairly well with plastic pegs. My chest plate pegs seem a little loose but I'm sure that varies figure to figure
-Ratcheting knee and arm joints. One of my arms has a weaker ratchet motion than other and cannot hold a gun up. I'm sure it would be great if both arms worked properly.
-Plastic coloring and paint apps were good. I do wish the Blue had been a little darker.
-The play value is there for kids 8 and up I would say. I'm not sure I'd give this pricey figure to someone under 8.

Cons:
-Figure hand design does not allow for guns to fit in securely. There should have been a peg mounted in the palm so guns could be held. I'm sure Takara or a Third Party will fix that annoying issue. Since one of my arms cannot hold a gun up I keep a gun in right arm and secondary gun attached to peg hole in leg.
-Plastic quality on arm shielding, head piece, and other areas is very thin and cheap feeling. I actually cut into the arm plating while removing one one of the plastic packaging fasteners and cut a chunk out of my Ultra Magnus arm. I was very unhappy with that as the scissors slipped and went through the plastic like it was nothing.
-Quality control issues abound with loose ratchet joints, and a very poor head/truck roof design that feels like it will break easily. The cheaper plastic is used here and some force is needed to flip out head into robot position. I have concerns a child could easily break the head off.
-Lack of some much needed paint applications like painted silver hubcaps. The very plain black plastic snap on wheels make the truck mode look very cheap. I will not be displaying in truck mode for any reason. I really do not think a child is going to care as this is a truck and there is room to transport other transformers on it.
-The figure is very hollow in all the wrong places. I miss the days where extra attention and plastic was given priority over rush to production/reduced cost.

Thanks for looking at my review.",My underwhelming expectations were met...plastic quality is lacking and there are quality control issues,True,13.0
B00ND5ZWKC,5.0,"Super awesome Ultra Magnus! First of all, it's pretty big. The box it came out of is also pretty big. I love the articulation and overall design. Very sturdy and playable. Good for rough kids if need be. I'm sure this will mostly be an adult item for collectors. I love the head sculpt a lot as it looks great.

The minimus figure is the only thing I dislike. It's so ugly and useless. I wish they didn't have him part of magnus. But whatever....

B00ND5ZWKC,5.0,"A really fantastic figure. Transforming him is a little on the complicated side, but there are no ""fiddly bits"" to snap off or the like.

His appearance is fantastic, with the reds and blues contrasting very well with the slightly-off-white sections.

The inclusion of Minimus Ambus, a character from IDW's recent line of comics, is both a good and bad thing - fans of the comics will probably enjoy having him, but G1 purists or people who don't like the comics would most likely rather not have to worry about him - while he fits inside Magnus very nicely in robot mode, in vehicle mode there's just no good place to put Minimus. He doesn't quite fit on any part of Magnus' car carrier securely or in a way that looks good.

B00ND5ZWKC,4.0,"Leader class Ultra Magnus is one big robot that has many nods to the g1 series and figure. The price was right compared to other toy sellers. I got him for $33.80 so it was a must buy. The reason I gave him a 4 star rating is not a knock on the figure it's self but more so on Hasbro. He is lacking paint apps that Hasbro could have easily done. I got the repro labels for him and they do not add that much, not enough to add the price of the stickers to the cost of the figure.

Great detail on the body, and it does a good job at hiding some of the flaws (for example the legs are hollow, but the way it folds up, all sides are covered and it looks great in the end).
Only caveat is that it is fairly difficult to transform. Nothing too crazy, but there are a lot of steps required.
Also, the little robot buddy? Throw away. At least on the version I received, the articulation is spotty. The primary mover is the torso (which flips up and down to convert between modes), but the joint in the torso is so stiff, and the arms and legs attached so weekly that his arms and legs pop off every time, and then you are still struggling to get the darn thing to move","Big, complicated, and extremely cool!!",True,

The Robot mode is absolutely amazing, he looks like he will destroy any Decepticon coming his way. What keeps Ultra Magnus from a 5 star rating are his weapons that don't seem to stay in his hands. But overall I highly recommend this toy to both children and Collectors",Money Well spent,False,
B00ND5ZWKC,5.0,"Excellent item, is almost similar of G1, only diferent is the truck don't separate, all is in one, bit is excellent addition for mu collection","Excellent item, is almost similar of G1",True,
B00ND5ZWKC,5.0,"Ultra Magnus is one of the greatest warriors the Autobots have.  He's confidence and power inspire others to follow him and trust him.  He is even respected amongst Decepticons who have battled him.  Either that, or the greatest lawman Cybertron ever had whose legend is kept alive by a suit of armor worn by someone taking the name and role of Ultra Magnus.

Ultra Magnus came to us in the 1985 Transformers The Movie, voiced by the late Robert Stack.  Back then he was an Optimus Prime figure painted white and stuffed into a body suit that made up his car trailer.  Since then, it seems Ultra Magnus was destine to be an Optimus Prime repaint.  Even a few years ago, that's what we got in a two-pack with Skywarp.

But this, this IS Ultra Magnus.  It's not an Optimus Prime ghost you slap in some armor to pass off as someone else. It is one solid figure, a car carrier truck that turns into a robot piloted by another robot. He is easy to transform and has a decent size for what you would expect of Ultra Magnus.  His guns and shoulder launchers can combine to form a hammer.

Even Minimus Ambus, the current bearer of the Ultra Magnus armor and persona in the IDW comics Transformers, is well sculpted.  He fits inside the chest of Ultra Magnus perfectly and is simple to transform as he becomes a little Cybertronian car.

If there is anything wrong with the figure it is a lack of good grip on the guns and there's no place to but the Minimus Ambus when you transform Ultra Magnus.

Use if with or without Minimus, but I highly recommend Ultra Magnus for any Transformers series",Ultra Magnus,True,
B00ND5ZWKC,5.0,"I had expectations for this figure after looking over reviews and I thought it would be decent.  After getting it out of the package, I really like this figure.  The figure is sturdy and is great for kids to play with.  You can definitely tell that this is Ultra Magnus and I am glad to have him at this price over the masterpiece version, which is a stellar figure if you have the money.  I did not care for Minimus Ambus, but it is cool to stick him in the the chest.  The cons I had were his hands not securing his weapons and having a flatter trailer for other figures to fit nicely.  Worth it, and you can find it on the hasbro site if you want it cheaper when available.",Best non-masterpiece Ultra Magnus,True,

B00ND5ZWKC,4.0,"Fun, but as we've come to expect lately with these Leader figures, scary thin.  Feels much more like a knockoff than a Hasbro product.

The 3 mini-figs are worth the price of this set alone.  Green Lantern is a classic DC guy to have and Sinestro's pink face looks amazing.  The best though is the space batman.  Most lego freaks probably have so many regular batman's of various styles (I feel he is like the spiderman of DC legos) that is was cool to get a brand new, unique batman.  He comes with 2 sets of wings, one open and one more closed.

The spaceship is a small, simple build but turned out really well.  It is nice to have a small jet to play around with, plus, traditionally, Hal Jordan was a jet pilot so I think they tried to make his ship look like a fighter jet.

The main build is GL's jet construct, it's very fun to put together and has a lot of play value, instead of the standard flick fire missiles we spring fire missiles and a couple of stud shooters on the wings, I'm not a huge fan of the flick fire ones and much prefer the spring loaded ones.  The down sides of this set are not really a big deal but, some people will notice.  Neither GL or Sinestro have power ring accessories, now maybe LEGO hasn't gotten around to making molds for those pieces yet, but for a set that's centered around these characters it would have been nice.  And Batman doesn't come with any batarangs, I would have given up the extra head they give him to have a couple batarangs, just the black ones, they would even need to be silver.  Overall this is a fantastic set for the price point, if you two of these you can put Sinestro's head on GL's body and have a Green Lantern Sinestro.  That would be cool for a lot of comics fans.",Fantastic set.,False,

B00NHQFQ8A,5.0,very good,Five Stars,True,
B00NHQFQ8A,4.0,"Finallya Green Lantern minifigure! I was waiting for ages for this and glad it happened! Been a green Lantern fan for decades.
This set contains three minifigures, one small cage and a spaceship.
Green Lantern is fantastic!  The printing on the front of his torso and legs are very good and resemble strongly with Green Lanterns actual costume in comics. His face printing is very nice (he has a double-sided face). The green mask print on his face (both sides) is quite good. His hairpiece, I guess, is a bit common one. Wish LEGO would have used a rare one.
Sinestro is also awesome-looking! Great printing on his torso (front and back) and legs. Decent printing on his face. He too has a double-sided face. His hairpiece is okay. Again, its a common hairpiece. And again I wish that LEGO would have used a rare one. Sinestro carries a weapon, his power staff which looks magnificent. It looks cool in transparent yellow. The top part of it is the Techno blade from the Ninjago theme from previous year and its a very good looking accessory. Wish LEGO would use more of this part in sets.
And now some major complaints with the Green Lantern (and Sinestro )minifigure.
The source of Green Lanterns power is his power ring. And sadly, there is no printing of a ring on Green Lanterns hand. Even a small green dot printed on the hand would have been good enough. But that wasn't to be. I think when LEGO DC designers are creating a super hero, they need to get the important details correct. Else whats the point? They cant just simply create a Superhero minifigure and expect that the fans of that superhero be satisfied. Same issue with the Sinestro minifigure; even he should had a small  ring printed on his hand.
When you look at the Green Lantern minifig from the front, he looks very good. Nice combination of green and black colors. But when you look at the side, you see only green (on the side of the torso and legs) and it gives a weird look. The printing on the front should have carried over to the sides also to give a proper look but it wasn't done. In fact LEGO rarely does any side printing that matches with the front. Its high time that LEGO starts doing it. For a brand of its huge reputation and high quality standards, it should do printing on the sides of the torso and legs. Just because its appropriate and required. Same issue with the Sinestro minifigure; he has only yellow on the sides but no black.
 The third minifigure is the Space Batman. Without any doubt, he looks very cool. Very detailed and nice printing on his torso (front and back). His cowl piece is fantastic! It was introduced this year (2015) and I think its way better that the previous cowl piece. This one looks more like the one in comics. Now Batman has two heads. One is the normal headpiece (double-sided) that usually comes with any Batman minifigure. Other one is specially meant for this version of Batman and it contains nice printing. Like a metallic mask underneath the cowl which gives a cool look. Now Batman comes with a cape which is shaped like a glider. But the disappointing thing is that this cape is NOT the usual hard plastic  (like the one we got in the Catwoman Cycle Chase 6858 set) but its like a very thin transparent plastic sheet. And you get two of those. One in open position and other in closed. But rather than getting two of this thin plastic cape I would prefer one made from hard plastic.  That would have looked much better.
And now one MAJOR complaint about this set. LEGO RARELY releases a DC Superheroes set that doesnt have a Batman in it. And its extremely irritating. Every year, we get at least four Batman sets and on top of that he is there in sets that are actually meant for Superheroes (Batman is NOT a superhero by the way). To make things worse, it is shown that the superheroes are badly in need of saving. And Batman always rescues them. And the Superheroes are always shown as morons. In the comic book that is included in this set, Green Lantern is shown as a dumbo who is easily overwhelmed by Sinestro. Even in LEGO Movie movie, Green Lantern was shown as a moron. Maybe for LEGO its all humor. But I don't think every DC fan would find it funny. The LEGO DC designers probably think that Batman is the God of DC Universe but someone needs to enlighten them. There are a LOT of DC Superheroes who are extremely popular. All I want is that someday LEGO would make sets for popular DC Superheroes like Flash, Green Lantern ,Aquaman etc WITHOUT including a Batman (or any character from the Bat Family)  in it. And when that day comes, I will be the happiest.
This set also includes a small cage-like structure. Its more like a transparent containment chamber. It looks okay. The black and yellow colors add to its appeal. The printed brick, that depicts the Yellow Lantern insignia, on the top of the chamber is very cool. Inside the chamber is the green lantern battery, which of course is shaped like a green lantern, like in the comics. This green lantern build looks okay but I have some complaints about it. First, it doesnt look very similar to the original. The handle part on the top  doesnt look good and spoils the look. This handle doesnt let the minifg hold the lantern in a convenient position, but in a awkward one.  Second, the size of the lantern is too big for a minifigure scale. This is a small build anyway, so LEGO should have gone with a molded piece which would have looked a hundred times better and also it could have been designed to look like the original. The chamber has a play feature where you move the printed brick a bit backwards and the front part drops open , revealing the green lantern.
Coming to the biggest part of this set, the space ship. The product description says its a spaceship but its actually a jet fighter plane. And its very similar to an ordinary fighter plane from LEGO that we (LEGO fans) have seen quite a number of times. Still, its quite good looking. The green and black colors, with bit of transparent green, add a lot of appeal. It has two spring loaded missiles. And the good part is that they are fully covered. When you rotate a lever, then they get fired. I just loved the design here. This is how spring loaded missiles should be designed and used. (Ive seen many LEGO sets where the spring loaded missiles will be fully exposed and you have to manually press on the back of them to release them).
Now this plane is supposed to be a construct created by the Green Lantern. But the thing is, any construct created by a Green Lantern (or any other Lantern) is transparent. And this plane is NOT transparent. It has very few pieces that are transparent. Now, if LEGO had given a plane in transparent green, that would have been the right thing to do and it would have been awesome! But sadly it was not to be. Now in the LEGO set Gorilla Grodd goes bananas, Wonder Woman has a transparent plane. So why was it not possible to give a transparent plane for Green Lantern? Its really disappointing that none of the LEGO designers observed this point. And another thing. While fighting Sinestro, Green Lantern would NEVER create a plane construct, he would rather create a cannon or a mech like thing. Green Lantern can anyway fly. He can also create any weapon he wants. Then why would he create a plane that fires just two missiles?? Wish the LEGO designers had put more thought into this. I am very sure that the people who designed this set are not at  familiar with Green Lantern mythology/story.
To wrap up, though I have mentioned a lot of complaints about this set, I am still happy that I got a Green Lantern minifigure , after waiting for many years. And though its not spectacular (and could have been better) , its good. And I got Sinestro, the nemesis of Green Lantern in the same set. Im satisfied. If you are a Green Lantern and LEGO fan, this is a must. Even if you are just into LEGO and not into Green Lantern, still you can buy this set because it has some lovely minifigures and a decent  plane.",Green Lantern makes his (LEGO) arrival in a official set!,False,

B00NHQFQ8A,5.0,"As a fan of both science fiction and superheroes, I was very excited to see Lego exploring the spacey side of DC Comics. This set is a very simple build, but a fun one and the playability factor is high. The minifigures are solid, and I was surprised to find myself liking Batman the most with his astronaut-inspired space gear. The real pleasant surprise for me here is how much I like Green Lantern's spacecraft. It looks fairly generic in pictures, but has nice form, feels good in the hand, has a great action features and incorporates a great assortment of translucent green parts. That is almost the greatest thrill of this set--so many green pieces in light and dark translucent and opaque colors. Worth picking up just for that. Also, two big printed pieces with the Green Lantern and Sinestro Corps logos. All in all, great value for under $20, especially if you are a fan of these characters. Three minifigures, many unique parts, and it feels much bigger than the on-the-box piece count suggests.

One thing that I want to mention specifically is the fantastic missile-firing mechanism. The spring-loaded launchers are built into the spacecraft and fired via a rather ingeniously simple mechanism that is operated by twisting one of the rear engines. Great design, easy to use, just make sure to aim at Sinestro and not at someone's eyes.","Good Value, Many Cool Pieces, Great Playability",False,5.0

Erika sings a few lines from different songs. The voicebox is in her torso area, and the sound is extremely clear, clearer than any singing doll I have ever heard (although my experience with that is limited).

My wife likes that the dress won't come off. It can't get lost and we don't have to encounter naked dolls everywhere. The guitar is tough to come off, which means my four year old daughter isn't likely to lose it as easily.

While both sing two songs, and they change from a long dress to a skirt, Erika changes by pulling her right arm and rotating her dress round to where it is a skirt, instead flipping round the top of her head.  This makes Erika easier to handle for smaller hands as her hair stays the same, instead of having it be either blonde or pink hair.  The four girls in my class, ages 6-10, also like that Erika had a guitar instead of a microphone.

The doll is versatile, either it's a princess or it's a pop star. With the push of the elbow the doll changes from skirt to dress, it also starts the music. The doll 'sings' two catchy songs that reinforce a positive can-do attitude.

There are a couple downsides to this doll, which is why we didn't give her 5 stars. She cannot sit, but she can stand by herself on hard surfaces.

She sings two songs when you press the pink diamond shaped ""necklace"" around her collarbone - ""Everyone wants to find out who they are for real, looking for a way to show it, tell you how I feel"" are some of the lyrics of one and ""Life is a song, we've got the key, be who you are, unlock your dreams"" is the other one.

My daughters' favorite, favorite, favorite part of this coming movie and the packaging of this doll and her movie co-star? The movie cover shows Courtney (who is white) and Erika both prominently. Why's that a huge deal to them? Well, Erika is clearly not white, and one of my daughters is white and the other black. They wrote to Mattel a few months ago asking for this sort of diversity because they were tired of only white dolls on the covers of Barbie movies. (Seriously, the placement of a prominent black character in this movie is huge, considering that on the covers of the 29 movies made by Barbie since 2000, only two included even one black character on the front, only one in a position of prominence.) Mattel replied letting us know that they had good things in the works that the girls would like and shared a little about this, so my girls are THRILLED.",love the doll AND the diversity in the movie!,False,3.0

B00U7EXH72,4.0,"So Air Hogs is a hit or miss company when it comes to drones, and in all honesty most of the time they miss more than a blind Stormtrooper at point blank range.  However if you're like me you keep buying them every Christmas hoping that this one won't make you want to throw it at the wall with Wookie rage. Well every once in awhile Air Hogs manages to step up their game and release a product that is absolutely amazing and stunning. This is that product, the Millennium Falcon quadcopter is that ""diamond in the rough"" drone from Air Hogs that we have been waiting for.  The Millennium Falcon is a quadcopter drone that is powered via 6 AA batteries and comes with a light up hyperdrive as well as two light up headlights and authentic sounds from the film. The details on this drone are also spectacular, they even added the little greeblies on the sides of the ship as well as the exhaust stains.
  As far as flying goes this drone has to be the smoothest and most fun drone that I have ever flown. It's gyro helps to hold it steady in the air and so long as you aren't super quick with your movements the drone stays steady and flies true. The drone comes with a ""hyperspace"" function that when pressed causes the Falcon to shoot forward at high speed for a couple of seconds before slowing back down again. I didn't have any real trouble with crashes but if you do manage to have a crash landing; the Falcon is made out of pretty durable foam. In terms of playability the Falcon is super fun I mean it looks cool and nothing beats having a Millennium Falcon that actually flies. However this drone isn't without it's flaws and these flaws are the reason for the star deduction.
  The first flaw that plagues this drone is a flaw that plagues literally every single one of Air Hog's drones and that is battery life. This thing takes a whole hour to charge and you only get 5 minutes of actual fly time. This pretty much means that this drone is little more than a desktop novelty that just so happens to be able to fly. The charge time will definitely tire out younger audiences because kids probably aren't going to want to wait 2 whole hours for 10 minutes of play. The second flaw is that it requires a bit more concentration to fly, I had no issues getting it to fly smoothly but it doesn't take a whole lot of movement on the sticks to do so. I found out pretty quick that any sort of jerky movements or making manuevers too fast would cause the Falcon to shake rapidly and occasionally lose lift. Hitting the hyperspace button however I found can sometimes level you out again. However if you aren't too rough with the sticks you will have absolutely no trouble getting the Falcon to soar around the room to recreate smuggling missions or blowing up the Death Star. The last flaw didn't affect my stars but it is a bit annoying especially if you have roommates. This drone is extremely loud and I mean very loud, the engines have a very annoying buzz but it's not really a huge issue more of a slight annoyance.
  All in all however I love this drone and I have played with it time and time again and gotten hours of fun. I love having a collectible Falcon sitting on my desk that I can also turn on and fly around the room if I wanted to. I also love the Empire Strikes Back headlights they added to it as well instead of just having the hyperdrive light up so having that ESB charm makes me nerd out even more (Of course Empire's Falcon is my favorite). Out of all the Air Hogs products I have bought and eventually returned this one is one that will be with me permanently. It's a great flier, it's a lot of fun, an it's just an all around cool product to have.

P.S. The Falcon can be flown outdoors as well since it has a 200ft range. However since it is made out of a very light foam I recommend flying where there is absolutely no wind since even a slight breeze can affect flight.",The Falcon flies again!!!!!!,False,

But also since it's foam, it's super susceptible to wind... it's great for indoors or REALLY calm days. It claims 200ft range and I believe it...

B00U7EXH72,4.0,"Okay, so this has some serious limitations.  But it's a ton of fun.

The battery, as many have said, only lasts about 10-15 minutes, and the means of charging is pretty weird (charge it through the controller through a USB).  It's lightweight, so it's not gonna work well outside, and any moving air can throw it off a bit.  And it's definitely overpriced because it's a Star Wars item.  For something that will probably get over used at first then wind up collecting dust, it's probably a stretch to pay close to $100 for it.

That said it's a lot of fun. We only use it indoor, and even though it doesn't last long before the battery dies out, it's a blast to fly around the house.

I have noticed that it's helpful to occasionally gently pull the propellors off in order to clean out any hair that may get wound around it.  If one of the propellors slows down at all it effects flight significantly.","Lots of fun, but overpriced",False,

Star Wars nut and drone aficionado that I am, this was the perfect gift.  The drone is different from other drones because the battery is internal and can't be removed.  Instead, we charge by connecting it to the remote controller.  If you use rechargeable batteries in the remote (six AA batteries; not included), you won't need to remove the batteries to recharge them.  A micro USB cable is included for that.

The remote has bonus sound effects that come directly from the controller and not the drone.  We get snippets of Chewbacca, R2, and more.  My only problem is the sounds do not consistently play when I press the button.

Compared to other drones, it is flyable but less stable.  There are no trim buttons, and it will fall out of balance when the turns are too sharp and quick.  It also lacks flipping functions, one button return to home, and headless mode.  I think it would have been the coolest thing to have headless mode and 360 degree eversion in order to make the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs.  Don't get me wrong.  I love this drone, but it could have been so much more.

The ship is very lightweight foam: 2.2 ounces, which means you don't have to register with the FAA to fly it.  All that soft foam helps protect the blades.  No replacement blades were included, but I don't think any will be needed.  The Falcon crashes without a scratch and it makes all sorts of crashing noises to let you know it has landed.  By the way, it has no landing gears.  I would have liked to see landing gears.  That would make takeoff a little smoother, because it leans to one side when sitting on the floor (the bottom is not flat).

Bonus credit for being a Star Wars drone, but I can't give five stars because of some of the issues.  I'm so happy they even make it and look forward to the next generation.",How Well Does It Fly?,False,
B00U7EXH72,5.0,"If you simply rate this on the fact it is Air Hog, I believe it is the best toy they have made.  Their helicopters were junk and broke within the first hour of use.

B00U7EXH72,4.0,"Pros:
- Looks just like the Millenium Falcon (squeeeee!)
- Lights up in front and back
- USB pass-through charge feature saves batteries
- Cool sounds
- Very durable
My son got the Playskool Falcon, and I wanted a companion toy, so this one went on my list. I knew I was getting a cool looking toy, not a pro quality drone, and so this unit actually exceeded my expectations. I've flown an Air Hogs copter before, so I was aware that the controls are very sensitive and difficult to learn, and that the battery life is quite limited. But when it looks and sounds this cool, you won't mind practicing (and crashing). It's so much fun! Just don't expect a precision instrument. You're paying for Star Wars awesomeness, not the best flying drone.

Cons:
- Due to extreme light weight and shape, it's difficult to fly. It's not impossible, though. You just have to practice. Mine will not hover, it continues to climb after taking off, so it keeps hitting the ceiling.
- Can't fly outside in a breeze, or even when the windows are open or the A/C is on (again due to light weight)
- Not robust enough to carry a camera
- Batteries not replaceable
- The sounds are very loud, and there's no volume control (but you can turn them off)",Mommy's favorite Christmas gift this year,False,

B00U7EXH72,4.0,"My first BzzAgent package arrived and in it was the Air Hogs Star Wars Remote Control Ultimate Millennium Falcon Quad to review. Please note that while I am a BzzAgent and receive free products in exchange for a review. Each opinion is my own and is not influenced in any way by any party but myself.

In this case my kids, all boys aged 7, 10 & 12 all participated in the review. What a better way than having and adult write this alone! Awaiting the arrival was just like Christmas..the moment I received the package we took everything out of the box and followed the instructions, placed batteries in the controller, charged the Millennium Falcon, then synced both. Once completed, we headed out doors.

Living in the country we have plenty of space to not have to worry.. was I wrong... It was so easy to fly on the first shot I sent it over the house from the backyard to the front yard! The lightness of the Falcon is amazing and yes wind does play a factor into this. It was not a calm day when we did this we had a wind that we had to compensate for but again this was not an issue. The remote control is very easy to use and provides easy adjustments. I never have been great at using these controls but with these it was easy.

What we loved about this is the fact that when crashed it does not break like some do, given the fact that it is made from high density foam is a major plus especially with kids. The older the better to maintain control. We landed it on the roof and no problem getting it off.

The sound effects are great as well are the light and we will definitely be using this at night time just to see it! Now you many wonder if We loved it so much, why the 4 stars. Battery life! We had apx 15 minutes of play time then let it cool for 15 minutes as per the instructions and charge again for an hour. This can be frustrating but in the end given it's lightness, one can understand why. It also states that this is for Indoor use... I do not know why not for outside as we did. It can get away from you and it will go far... I did not test the distance, but from our backyard over the house to our front yard was a good 200 ft! I laughed when I did this of course as I was worried I damaged the Falcon but again no issues.

One last note if you are using it outside on grass, make sure the gars is trimmed before you use it. The four rotors cut grass very well, but now they are turning green!

Highly recommend this for a fun time with your kids!",First flight over the three story house! What a great ride for my three boys who charge it over and over to keep flying it.,False,13.0
B00U7EXH72,5.0,"I have to say I was not expecting the performance that was to come. When taking it out of the box it seemed like it was going to be a really cheap light weight toy and would not fly well at all.  BUT ... to my surprise and my sons, it flys great. Once you figure out the controls and how to vary the blades speed to maintain lift it works great. The only negative thing I can say is that I wish the battery would last longer. I know that they wanted to keep it light but a little more weight for longer flying time would have been great. Very easy to charge and a wonderful toy for all ages. I received the product as part of a promotion from the Air Hogs brand.",Very Surprised after opening the box.,False,
B00U7EXH72,4.0,Takes a little getting used to. Sound is cool but does come from the controller. Is a fun toy and very nostalgic. Hyper drive button actually makes it move forward but not any faster than just pressing forward. Does not fly well with any breeze but is very durable.,Little over priced but fun,False,
B00U7EXH72,5.0,"I see a lot of people complaining about this toy, mainly about low flight time and controls. My experience is totally different from people who got lemons only worthy of 1 or 2 stars. When I got mine out of the box I thought the toy was a little smaller than I expected it would be based on the videos I saw of it flying but once I got my Falcon up in the air I quickly forgot about it's size because it looks so dam cool hovering around the house with it's lights on. I took it for a few test runs outside and quickly realized that it takes some practice to master the throttle and turning stick while simultaneously using the other stick which controls the craft's pitch and yaw. I would not recommend flying outdoors if there is even the slightest breeze. The wind will blow you drone around, draining your battery faster and making harder to control. For first time users I would recommend learning how to take off and hover first because the throttle is a little touchy. You have to give it 90-100% throttle to take off and once you are the air you have to immediately drop it down to about 75% throttle to keep the craft from going into your ceiling or a tree. Once you learn how to take off and hover, practice turning the craft around next. Once you get a feel for hovering and turning move on to putting the nose down and accelerate forward and lifting the nose up to go backwards. You also can veer right and left using the right control stick as well. Once you master the controls this little drone flies like a dream and is a lot of fun. It took me about 20 minutes to get the controls down well enough to fly indoors without crashing every 5 seconds. As far as flight times go I don't know where people are getting these piss poor flight times from. My drone flew a solid 15 minutes before it needed a recharge. And trust me 15 minutes of flying around in your house is plenty enough time to have a hell of a lot of fun. I found that it takes so much concentration to fly that 15 minutes is plenty time for me before I want to take a break. Charging did not seem to take that long maybe 20-40 minutes. I didn't really follow the instructions and I don't know if my flight times were that terribly effected by not letting the batteries charge for a full hour. I also didn't let the battery cool for 15 minutes before flying but I probably will from now on. All in all I think this AirHog drone is as good if not better than what you can expect to get with the other Air-Hogs toys. I had a few AirHogs helicopters before and if you ask me this Millennium Falcon blows those helicopters out of the water, when it comes to flight performance, flight time, and overall fun. I don't know maybe because of the fact that this is such an iconic spacecraft adds to the fun, but I'm not a huge StarWars fan either so I don't feel like this influences my review very much. I haven't seen any of the new StarWars movies, lol so anyone who thinks this must be a biased review can cram that thought right back into their tiny little brain. I will say this, the drone is overpriced, especially on Amazon for some reason. I bought mine at Walmart for $83.00 dollars with tax included, I have no idea why people are paying upwards of $150.00 dollars on Amazon. I do know that because this is a StarWars toy crooked people are ""retail scalping"" and ripping ignorant consumers off by buying these in bulk, jacking up the prices and reselling them. Be smart and get your drone for $80.00 or less at a big box store. Another thing about this product is it seems to be hit and miss as far as the quality of the electronics and mechanical parts are concerned. It looks like a lot of people are getting lemons. My advice is buy at Walmart and if you get a lemon return it for a new one until you get one that is sold. Test it in the parking lot if you want to save on time. I actually can't get my controller speakers to work with mine so I don't have sound so I will have to take my drone back, which is fine by me as long as I don't get a lemon. And finally all I can say is I wish Air-hogs would have put their laser battle technology in these StarWars drones so you could battle your friends flying different StarWars fighters, that would have be so much fun.",Solid toy that is tons of fun as long as you don't get a lemon.,False,

B00VWULBKK,4.0,"Push a Monster adds itself to a large choice of games intended for young kids around 5.

The three biggest questions I have about games like this are: Are kids going to be interested in playing the game?  Do kids get anything out of the experience other than learning to take turns? And can the adults they're playing with find enough there so that they're not bored out of their minds?  A lot of the alleged ""classics"" like Chutes and Ladders completely fail on point 2.  All those games do is teach taking turns and nothing else because no skill is required to play.  And point 3 can be hard to accomplish because just about any game intended for 7 and under can be mind numbing to an adult, especially with repeated plays.

So how does Push a Monster do with these three criteria?  Surprisingly well.

The game is brightly colored and draws kids into wanting to play.  The rules are simple, although young kids will need some guidance.

Like many of the great modern games that have been released in the last ten years, Push a Monster does go beyond teaching taking turns.  One, this is primarily a dexterity game so that means improving eye-hand coordination.  Two, there's a smidgen of strategy to this game because you have a choice where you place the monster on the small table so if some do fall off you can at least try to make it one of the smaller monsters instead of the bigger ones.  This is not a huge decision, but it is a decision so it makes this game certainly better than the old school games.

The game is weakest on point three.  There's a bit too much luck involve to keep adults interested for long.  However, the game isn't mind numbing and as long as your focus is on experiencing the game with your child then it will work fine.

There are already a number of dexterity games for this age range so you also have to question whether this is a better choice or not.  We already own Zitternix which is VERY simple and cheap so no comparison, Pharaoh's Gulo Gulo which might be better suited for 6-7 year olds but some 5 year olds can handle it, and Animal Upon Animal which I think requires even more eye-hand coordination than Push a Monster and is bit more complicated rules.

I think the game that most reminds me of Push a Monster is Animal Upon Animal.  Both games have you rolling a die on your turn to determine what your next action is.  The two differences that stand out to me are that 1)in Animal Upon Animal you can luck out with the die roll and penalize another player and 2)the colors are soooo subdued and bland compared to Monster.  (There is a more colorful edition of Animal called Balancing Bridge, but it's very hard to find as of this writing.) I personally don't like Animal Upon Animal that much and prefer Push a Monster if given a choice.  Others might think differently.  The reason I don't really like Animal to Animal is that the rules are a lot more fiddly compared to Monster.  Animal is actually the deeper game (although that's not huge given they're both kids dexterity games), but that's the result of the rules not the act of placing versus pushing the various pieces. If I want something deeper I'd rather play Gulo over Animal.

With all of this in mind I can easily recommend this to parents with kids in the 5-6 year range and perhaps even some 4 year olds.  I definitely do not recommend it for much older than 7.  The question of your child connecting to the theme is also huge - do they like silly monsters?  I can see some kids loving this and others not really caring that much.

Overall Push a Monster is a solid entry into the child's dexterity game market that's different enough and colorful enough to warrant buying for many parents.  If you have a 4-6 year old it's a great choice.",A great dexterity game for young children,False,25

This game falls on the simpler end (easy instructions and plays in about 15 minutes) and for what it is, I think it is very well done.  The monsters are wooden and the cards very stiff cardboard.  It will last a long time.  Each turn, you put the monster you rolled on the large pusher and push it onto the arena with the smaller one.  Others get pieces for the monsters you knock off.  But there is some strategy because the winner doesn't simply have the most monsters.  The pieces are different sizes.  Two green ones make a shorter line than one purple one and you win by having the longest line.  The arena isn't square.

B00VWULBKK,4.0,"This is a game that surprised us with its clever simplicity and the quick, fun play it presents!  I would definitely suggest setting it up ahead of time because the application of stickers to monster outline shaped pieces of wood was tedious and made the kids stir-crazy.  Yes, I could have delegated some of that, if I didn't mind stickers all askew and falling off the little pieces...it was tricky enough for me to do.  We actually had 2 wood pieces that were too small for the stickers!  They have unique shapes, so it wasn't that I was confused...they were the largest of the shapes, too, so not easy to mix up.

By the time I finished applying decals and popping out cardboard pieces, the kids had pretty much disintegrated into a grumpy mess and I wasn't sure this game would be playable with the moods they were in.  It turned out to be just perfect for the range of ages we had playing...4 children ranging from 5-10 and a couple more watching/advising/cheering.

The quality of the game is great. You do have to do some assembly however so unless you want to hear ""are you done yet?"" put it together before telling the kids you have it and plan on playing it.

The game itself can be played by all ages but for really young players you might want to team them up with older players so they don't get discouraged as it does take some dexterity to ""win"" the game even though some luck and chance are involved. Basically the goal of the game is to push (with a tool) the monster you have to put on the board into the area without knocking any other monsters down. If you knock a monster down other players get a scoring advantage.

B00VWULBKK,5.0,"Some folks say here that this is a game for really young children. We got it for a 7 and 9 yr old, and they've had a good time with it with their friends, for the 2 weeks we've had it so far. What we like most about this game is that it's not only a board game where you role the dice and move your player, with the outcome determined mostly by chance.

This game is interactive. That is, it is a game of pushing monsters, and each player gets to push their (wooden) monster onto the board, with a special ""pusher."" This does require skill (where to enter the game?) plus strategy (if another monster falls off, how to best prepare to make sure it's not a really big one?). It does take thought, and hand-eye coordination.

Does the game appeal to kids? And does it entertain them for a period of time? Do they want to play again? So far, the answer to these 3 important questions is, yes.

The game itself is nicely made, which you need to count on for something that costs about $33.

We won't tell you all the rules here, but to summarize: you start with 7 monsters on the game board (the arena). Players then roll the monster die, with pictures of monsters on it. Whatever monster comes up is the one they pick from the supply, and must push onto the arena. They have to be careful, because if any monster falls off as a result, all the other players get a monster token. At the end of the game, the player with the most tokens, wins.

There is some assembly required. The wooden pieces need to have their appropriate sticker applied, as does each face on the die. This can be as much fun as the game, in our experience.

Overall, this is a fun, well thought out game, nicely made.

B00VWULBKK,4.0,"This is a German children's game that requires skills similar to that used in games like Operation. That is, it's necessarily to size up the spatial situation and determine how best not to trigger an undesired outcome. The instructions are pretty easy to follow and the game can be played by anyone with reasonable manual dexterity of varying ages.

The basics of the game are that you have a platform with wooden pieces that you add new pieces to using a tool that allows you to push your piece onto the crowded platform and try not to knock any other pieces off. Other players gain points (in the way of cards) if you knock off other pieces. The player with the most points wins. There is strategy, but it's all based on analyzing the board and deciding which pieces are least or most at risk for falling off.

The quality of the game pieces is very good, though some assembly is required. You need to first attach a lot of stickers to the wooden pieces and the single die. The little platform is cardboard, as is the two-piece tool for pushing the pieces onto the platform. This is a shame because, if they were wood as well, the entire game would have a stronger sense of heft and longevity. However, this is not a significant demerit.

I think the main issue with this game is that it probably won't be interesting for as long as more sophisticated games. Part of the problem is the inevitability of pieces falling off at some point regardless of the player's skill level. This means that skill will only get you so far before you know it's just a matter of time and luck. I think it may have been more interesting with a larger platform or some other random elements built in, but it is a solid basic game which is well-made.","fun little game, but limited long-term interest level",False,7
B00VWULBKK,5.0,"Yes, I am one of ""those"" grandmas.  The kind that LOVES to play board games and is always on the lookout for those rare ones that appeal to all ages, from the very young to the very....well, like me. :)  When I was offered this game for free in exchange for my honest review, I was more than happy to give it a go--and am I glad that I did.  When it comes to games for kids, especially the preschool aged ones, I personally have 3 criteria I look for to determine a game's merits:

(1) Is it easy and fast to learn?This game is almost genius in its simplicity.  And when it comes to young children, simple is good.  Simple is great, in fact. Kids don't want long, involved, detailed, elaborate explanations and rules on how to play a game; they just want to GET TO IT. It takes about 2 minutes (tops) to explain how this game is played and what the few rules are.  I was going to attempt to explain the game play here, but then I noticed that there is a very detailed step-by-step explanation of it on Amazon's product page, so no need for me to do it again.  If it ain't broke, right? But if you'll take just a moment to read the explanation of of the game play, you can see that in this Push-a-Monster game, all you really have to do is: PUSH!  Push your monster on to the Arena Board while trying not to knock another one off, thereby helping your opponents and not yourself.  Of course, since the Arena Board is just so big, and there are just so many monsters that can fit on it before some of them are inevitably going to fall off, you're bound to see some furrowed brows, perhaps a little maneuvering of the Arena Board as they peruse it from different angles, complete with little tongue poking out the side of their mouth in deep concentration.  You can almost see their little brains spinning as they're thinking ahead, calculating, and then just finessing a bit to just...try...to...squeeeeeeeze this guy...right...there! Whew!  Plenty of whoops, more than a few groans, and laughter by the bucketful!  Sheer genius.

(2) Is the game play fairly short?  Short people (in this case I refer to children) usually have matching attention spans: i.e., short!  As for duration, our average game took about 15 minutes -- which, at least with the little ones in my life, is long enough to be enjoyable and fun, but short enough to keep them coming back for more.  (Warning: They will ALWAYS want to play it ""just once more!"")  Because of its brevity, however, it makes a great little game to play if they have only a few minutes before bed.

(3)  Is it FUN?  When it comes to my grandkids and me, I can answer with a very enthusiastic YES! Absolutely.  I have four grandkids ranging in age from 18 mos. to 11 years.  Now of course we don't invite the youngest to play because he only tries to eat the game parts.  But the others (ages 5, 9, and 11) are ALWAYS up for a game, but the 5-year-old definitely falls into the short attention span department.  He LOVES this game.  It's a game he can play with his older siblings and, because of its very nature, he finds himself on an even playing field.  These kids love to play games together but the older ones do NOT feel the need to LET the younger ones win, so any and all wins in this family are earned on one's own merits! :)  In fact, my hat is off to the designers who managed to come up with a game that is simple enough for very young ones but fun enough that their older siblings, parents, and grandparents will have no problem taking 15 minutes out to play it with them.  And whether you're 5 or 65, it's anybody's guess as to who will win in the end.

Not as high on my personal list of priorities but definitely a plus is how well the game is made.  I was VERY pleasantly surprised when I first opened the box and saw the quality of this game.  The ""monster"" pieces that get pushed around are made of very high quality wood and will probably last longer than I will. :)  The monster card tokens that are collected throughout the game are printed on very heavy duty cardboard stock, again something I would expect to last a very long time.  Just to be thorough, I will say that there are many pieces to this game, including 27 wooden monsters and 81 monster card tokens.  If your kids/grandkids are anything like mine, it's far more likely a piece of two will come up missing before any of them actually get damaged.  However, it should be noted that the game does include a very nice heavy-duty partitioned insert (designed to remain in the game box) that conveniently holds all the little adorable (did I mention they are cuter than cute?) monster pieces and cards.

So that's it, folks: quick and easy to learn, 15 minutes to play, and the kind of fun that makes memories.  All that and built-in storage, too -- what more could we ask for?  Now I've got to go - I actually had to tell some short people that Noni couldn't push any more monsters for a while because she needed to go write a review.  I hope it's helped!

We really enjoy VTech toys and the Spin and Learn Ball Tower is fun for our 16 month old. He does dance and smash the buttons for the songs to come on. The batteries in this toy are the same we put in two months ago so I wouldn't consider this toy eating up batteries. The tower did come together easily which was a relief. My 12 year old nephew is the one that put it together with no problems.

Our two older kids do like to play with their brother (voluntarily) and will bring this toy out to see how many balls they can put in it. I've posted a picture that shows two green balls and it only comes with one. This is from another toy but want to assure you that they will come out and don't often get stuck. The kids (or you) just have to keep clicking the blue switch for the balls to drop. However, if they drop other toys in there that aren't round you pretty much have to dump it upside down and shake!

B00Y53V8TU,4.0,"I received this toy for free from VTech in order to share a review. All opinions are my own.

This toy has been keeping my 20 month old learning and engaged while I get things done around the house. I don't normally let her toys ""babysit"" her, but I really appreciate that it's been keeping her attention for long enough bursts of time that I can finish some dishes or fold some laundry.

I also sit down and play with it alongside her some times, and one thing I noticed was that it sometimes gets the colors mixed up. I'm not sure if we're doing something wrong or if it's just finicky, but I am not depending on it to teach her her colors, so I still think it makes a great interactive toy.

 I've heard her repeat a few phrases, so she is definitely picking something up while playing. It teaches different bug and animals names, plus colors and numbers and there are so many different ways to play with it, it really keeps little ones busy. Best for babies who sit up to walking toddlers. Too young it would be hard for them to play with and too old may not be interested.

B00Y53V8TU,4.0,"Things I love about the VTech Spin and Learn Ball Tower:
1. It teaches children to identify colors! My 2 1/2 year old hasn't picked up on colors as easily as his older brothers, so having a toy that teaches and reinforces color identification is a big plus. Each ball is a different size and different color. The Spin and Learn tower recognizes the ball based on its size. When you drop the ball into the dome of the ball tower it will say the color of the ball (if you have it on the color mode).
2. Motor skills: There are a variety of ways the child can manipulate the ball tower. By pulling the little lever on the top part of the tower you can spin the balls and cause a ball to drop down into the ball slide. Spinning the balls with the lever takes and teaches a little bit of manual motor skill. The other levers to make the balls stop and go along the slide, however are fairly easy for the youngest of tots to move. My little troublemaker (and I refer to him as that in the MOST affectionate way) loves launching the ball completely off the tower base with the lever at the bottom of the ball tower.
3. Introduces numbers, animals, and playful music. Using the buttons at the top, the child can select what concept the tower will teach (play). On the back of the tower the parent or guardian can select the volume level (hallelujah!).
Things that weren't so great:
I have no complaints with the ball tower itself, it just isn't active enough for my SUPER active child. He likes it and will play with it for a few minutes at a time, but it doesn't hold his attention for very long. He will turn 3 in just a few months so he's already at the top of the age range for this toy. As a mom who has been through a lot of baby and toddler toys, I think the Spin and Learn Ball tower would be awesome for babies and toddlers just a bit younger than my little guy.

B00Y53V8TU,5.0,"The Spin and Learn Ball Tower is fun for toddlers. Our 2-year-old daughter loves to play with it, and her older brothers like to help. Kids that age love pushing buttons, and there are plenty of buttons to press.

The tower has two modes, the color mode and the number mode, and the interactive ball tower counts the balls and even recognizes the colors, and the identity of the animal as the balls are released and find their way down the slide. To release the balls, the child has to turn a knob, one thing that my kids found especially fun.

As a parent I especially appreciate the two different volume levels, and the fact that the Spin and Learn Ball Tower only uses 2 AAA batteries. Batteries are included, which is always a plus, but the toy also works well with rechargeable batteries. This toy has the automatic shut-off feature that I love about Vtech toys, because if it has not been played with for about 60 seconds, it will start powering down, and all it takes to turn on is pushing one of the buttons.

The Spin and Learn Ball Tower is easy to put together, even without instructions, and once its put together it sticks well and has to be forced apart. This is a big thing, as it keeps the toy in one place even and makes it easy to pull out for fun another day. The four balls also stay inside the ball tower unless the knob is turned, which means that they can stay put until another day.

I really like how the ball tower resembles a bubble gum machine. There are two different modes and two different volume levels. It has four buttons across the top and four balls to correspond with them. Depending on what mode it's in, it will either count the insects on the button or tell you the color of the insects on the button. It will also tell you which ball you put in and has a drop door, a push in door, and a ball flip lever, which is actually pretty cool.  I'm not sure if any of my kids (ages 2, 4, or 7) realized that :).

While the packaging states that this toy is intended for ages 9 - 36 mos, I think it would be best for about 12-18 months.  There are features that a younger baby would like (the buttons and balls), so feel free to buy it early, but my 2 year old is a little on the higher end, especially since he is the youngest of 3 and always trying to keep up with the bigger kids.

He really does enjoy the Spin & Learn Ball tower, but I would not start out at this age. We were able to fit a large number of matchbox cars in the bowl at the top. Luckily, they were easy to get out. Much easier than the tank of my carpet cleaner. Ahem.

It was super easy to assemble and while I didn't have helpers this time, it wouldn't have mattered.  Super easy, sturdy, high quality and the sounds on this toy definitely have the VTech feel. They are not obnoxious and one sound made me miss the book thing we had that finally bit the dust. But just a bit.

My older boys (5 & 4) get more out of it since they can appreciate the learning features a bit more. It can identify which ball color, etc is placed inside it can count how many balls you put in, and it's also fun to shoot the balls around and spin them out like a gumball machine.

This VTech Spin and Learn Ball Tower is currently a favorite at my house among the toddler age.  The little ones love playing with the balls and watching them fall through the tower as the color and number is announced out loud.  This has a ton of learning opportunities with 100 songs, melodies and phrases!  Pretty impressive!  It is the perfect size for little ones sitting or standing.  The songs aren't super annoying like many other toddler toys and the fact that my little ones are learning makes it worth it.

B00Y53V8TU,5.0,"We love this ball tower!
My 21 month old loves toys that encourage activity, and I love toys that will keep him entertained for more than 3 minutes at a time - this toy meets both of those expectations!

My son really loved putting the balls in the top over the tower, and when the toy switched from reading colors of the balls to animals on the balls (based on the settings), he got really excited.

The toy is really easy for little hands to manipulate. For example, the handle to ""spin"" the balls was really easy to use, so even my baby could use it independently without becoming frustrated.

He loves the lights and sounds, and the songs and tasks keep him busy for quite some time while I prepare dinner!

The colored balls spin & slide down the ball tower while it teaches numbers and colors. It has over 100 melodies, phrases, and sounds. My mother in-law put it together while I was out, so unfortunately I can't say personally how set up was, but she said that she did it one handed while holding my baby, so I'm guessing it's pretty simple ;) The toy does seem very sturdy. I like that it teaches insects, numbers, colors, and songs, but my favorite part is all of the awesome fine motor skills that it teaches!! My 2 year old is learning how to push, pull, lift, turn, etc and this is helping him to do all of that as he figures out how to make the ball go down the tower. I love that he can work on that and my baby can enjoy the toy, too. There is a fear of kids putting other toys besides the balls down the toy, but I love that this is clear (unlike some similar toys where the balls shoot out but the toys are opaque so it's way harder to see where the toys are) because you can see if there is another toy in and get it out fairly easily. This is a new favorite in our house, and I think it would be a great gift for a baby or young toddler.

Most toys don't keep my three sons' interest for long. I wasn't sure about this one, but actually all three - ages one, four, and six, I have enjoyed using it and playing with it together. There are lots of things to look at and do!  I love that there are four different balls so each of the boys can have one and play together. Even though this isn't meant for older kids, they still love it and have fun playing with their baby brother. This is one of the few toys that has held their attention and been something that they play with each day. It has become a fixture in our main living area because it is so much fun!

The songs are delightful, and there are lots of things to learn as well. I love that there are two volume options!

B012MGTMUS,5.0,"This figure brings us Black Panther as he appears in the movie, Captain America:  Civil War, and it looks great.  The patterns in his costume are etched in with exquisite detail from head to toe.  He has very small silver paint applications in various places, like his knuckles, claws, and face mask, and it all looks basically flawless.  He's highly articulate, with tight joints.  My figure did come with a slightly loose abdominal joint, but it doesn't interfere with posing him on my bookshelf.

The accessories include an interchangeable head, and a left leg piece for the Giant-Man ""Build-a-Figure.""  The spare head looks good, and renders a decent likeness to the actor, Chadwick Boseman.  Having the option to display T'Challa without his mask is rather nice.  The Giant-Man leg also comes in fine detail...from the texture of the padding on the knee and sides of the leg, to the tiny lines in the pattern on the lower leg.  I was surprised by how detailed the leg was, once I had it in my hands.

Overall, Black Panther is a top quality figure in the Marvel Legends line.  It would've been perfect if it had included a spare set of hands for posing him without his claws out, but aside from this, it's a solid 5-star figure.

This version is based on the movie figure, not the comic book (although the comic version is very similar anyway). Along with the spare head, it would've been great to add 2 fists to go along wih the claws....but still, fantastic figure. Many have asked why the price is higher than expected. Not defending scalpers here- if you can find it for under $20-30.00, go for it. The Black Panther doesn't get a lot of figures, and typically when he does, they sell out fast. Does your local store usually have a good stock of these figures? Availability then becomes an issue. Does this happen to every figure? No. How can you tell which ones will be rare and which ones won't?  I thought for sure Capt Marvel would sell out fast, but she didn't.

B014G1PFTE,5.0,"One of the main reasons we have started gardening more and more is because of how easy and fun it is to do with the entire family. Everyone, of any age, can easily participate and help out in some way. There is always something for someone to do in gardening.

After starting Our First Lasagna Garden we have decided to mainly make it our vegetable garden. Even though it is small, and right now a winter garden, we are showing our three year old son, Xavier, how to help out. It is much easier to teach him now before we have really nice plants, much like the garden grows, so does our sons knowledge of gardening. We are hoping that this lasts, and that our son can garden like a pro with us.

A big problem we have presently run into is having the right tools. Novices at gardening, we mistakenly bought whatever was in the dollar store that fit our budget. Only to end up with sore hands, and backs, and not getting the gardening results we wanted. I also had no good tools that were safe or easy for our son to use. The adult tools were much too big for him, and his plastic beach shovels and toys were too easy to break in our garden.

I was contacted by the wonderful people at Roca Home to see if we would like to test out their kids and adult set of garden tools. Of course we were elated to be able to try them out just in time to start our winter garden.

The adult set is called the Roca Home Best Gardening Kit it comes with a three piece garden tool set and a garden tool organizer bag that is waterproof. The tools are made of top quality materials that will never rust and are made with strong durable materials to add long lasting value to your garden tools. The handles are contoured soft leather designed to minimize joint and muscle pain. We loved the adult garden tools. The bag is awesome it zips up entirely and is sealable. The tools are gorgeous and are so easy and comfortable to use. My hands are so thankful we have really nice garden tools. The Roca Home Best Gardening Kit is a great deal for the price and makes an awesome gift for any garden lover in your life. You can get a discount if you purchase the adult tools with the kids set.

Roca Home also makes a Kids Gardening Tool Set. The moment Xavier laid eyes on it he fell in love. He has loved gardening since we started it, and the tools got him even more excited. Every day he is outside with his tools at least watering with the watering can if nothing else. I love how durable they are, and how beautifully fun and bright they are, it makes it easy to find the tools when he leaves them around the yard. The seven pocket tote bag is the perfect size for little hands to put and pull out tools, as well as cart around the yard on their own. They are amazingly easy for our son to use, yet very useful as he can really complete tasks with them.

The Roca Home Kids Gardening Tool Set is real gardening tools for kids made in the perfect size for little hands. They are built with strong durable materials to last many happy hours in the garden playing and learning along the way. They really inspire children to go out and play by just looking at them. The set includes trowel, rake, shovel, Learning Guide Top 10 Good Insects for Your Garden, watering can and tote bag. It is a complete set of fully functioning garden tools.

We adore both of the Roca Home garden tools both for adults and kids. The Kids Garden Tool Set is also great for the beach. The Kids Garden Tool Set is perfect for children ages 3 and up, but adult supervision is always advised due to some sharp edges. Both of the sets are light and easy to use. They made gardening so much easier and a lot more fun. They were so simple, yet something we never would have thought mattered or to buy ourselves. These are great Holiday gifts or for any occasion.

B014G1PFTE,5.0,"My daughter is 5 and loves planting and growing flowers. Its a special thing we can do together that we both enjoy. Adult tools can be heavy and sharp though so I went looking for a children set and found this one by ROCA home. The set comes with a carrying bag, a watering can plus 3 digging tools the perfect beginners set for my daughter as she branches out into gardening. The bag  carries all the tools and is the perfect size for my daughter. The bag doesnt get too heavy and yet is durable enough to be dragged around my a 5 year old. The stitching and fabric of the bag is thick and sturdy and built kid tough.
The watering can and the tools are made of a thicker plastic, not that thin unsteady plastic most children set are made of. This set digs down into the dirt effectively and scoops perfectly. My daughter loves that she can be just like mommy with this little set and I love that the set is so well made and durable.

B014G1PFTE,5.0,"I've bought kids gardening tools in the past, and none have been as good as these! I'm used to the flimsy plastic with the ultra girly designs. I just wanted something neutral that actually feel like real grown up gardening tools. These are it! They don't feel like toys.
The tools are metal with smooth edges and comfortable plastic handles. Not too light, not too heavy for little hands. The gardening bag is a nice quality canvas with plenty room for the tools and any extras you'd like to carry along. The watering can is plastic, and even though it wasn't as much a big deal to me, the kids for some reason love it. With the colder weather approaching, I'm thinking the watering can will get a lot of use with the houseplants. The tools can also be used with sand at the playground. The bug booklet is a nice touch!
I'm really pleased with this product, and feel it's actually priced quite low for what it is. This is something I'd be more than comfortable giving as a gift.

B014G1PFTE,5.0,"I absolutely adore this kids gardening set from ROCA Home and so does my daughter! I bought the adult gardening set, also from ROCA Home, and loved it so much that when I saw that they also had a kids set I knew I had to have it! My daughter who is 2, loves to imitate everything I do from doing laundry, to cleaning, to...well just about everything, so I knew she would love to ""help"" mommy garden as well. I was so pleased when I got these in the mail, and once again ROCA Home did not disappoint. This is an adorable tool set. It is not a cheaply made toy set, but real garden tools that are actually able to be used in the garden. The set comes with 3 tools: a trowel, a rake, and a shovel. The handles are made out of a strong plastic, and are attached securely to the tops which are made out of painted steel so they will last a long time. They also are rust resistant. It comes with a cute plastic watering can that is the perfect size for little hands. The carrying case is not only cute, but very well made out of a high quality canvas material that will repel moisture. The colors are very bright and vibrant, and would be suitable for either a boy or a girl. It has 3 smaller pockets on the back which are the perfect size to hold the tools, and 2 bigger pockets on the front and each side to hold seed packets or other tools. The watering can fits nicely inside the bag. Included is also a colorful guide to the ""Top 10 Good Insects for Your Garden"" for your child to look at and learn. My daughter's eyes just lit up when she first saw this set, and she carried it around the house and played with it the rest of the day. We haven't had a chance to use them outside yet, but I can't wait to do some gardening together. I can't say enough good things about this quality set, and I wish I could give it more than 5 stars! I would highly recommend it to any parent who has a child that loves doing everything with them, you won't regret it! Or if you would like to give it as a gift, it comes in a really cute box that is perfect for gifting. ***I received this set at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

B014G1PFTE,5.0,"This is a nice quality set for toddlers.  It is very well thought out gardening tote - large enough for toddlers, lots of storage in the tote, nice quality and variety of tools, good size watering can!

The garden tools are made of plastic and metal.  I looked at the pieces and they are very good quality considering they are made in China.  The metal is sufficiently heavy and looks like it will withstand digging.  The plastic handles are also very sturdy.  These look like mini-versions of real tools. My toddler has already started pretend playing with the tools inside the house since we're still a few months away from being able to dig in the dirt.

The tote is made from a very thick canvas like material.  The watering can fits into the tote and the tools fit in the many pockets of the tote.

The watering can is also made of a sturdy plastic.  There was no strong smell like you get from some cheap plastic products.  It's shaped a little like a teapot almost so my toddler has pretended to use it as a teapot for his tea party!  Great for replay before spring even starts.

There was a nice like pamphlet inside that included information about beneficial insects.  My toddler has already pointed to the pictures and asked me to read it to him several times.

The tote and all the tools fit inside a small box and amazon used a pretty small box to ship it as well.  It was packaged very tightly to save the environment and space.  I was surprised when I opened the box and thought I would be disappointed that everything would be too small but they are perfect for little hands.

Now - because it is a display doll and the doll will most likely stay in the presentation case, I was disappointed because the case was scuffed obviously from shelf wear  not badly, but enough to be seen and distract when light shines on it.

Click n' Play Pretend & Play Doctor Set ""provides the perfect way to ease children's anxieties about doctor visits.

This Pretend & Play set is a great way to help children better understand their world while developing early language and social skills. Role playing doctor or hospital visits eases children's' anxieties and encourages empathy.""

This Doctor Play Kit has 15 pieces and is geared for kids 3+.  My 5 and 8 yr. old girls LOVE this kit.  I love that the case has a spot for every item, making clean-up & storage easy.  I didn't love that the cell phone didn't come with a battery, however, I do love that the cell phone was made to take AA batteries because they are easy to replace and most people have them in their home.  The specialty batteries are expensive and hard to find, and quite frankly a pain in every aspect; and therefore leads me to my main complaint about the included stethoscope battery.  However, the stethoscope and cell phone makes sounds, and the my girls love that!

The manufacture description states the kit is made of environmental and kid safe plastic, however, I could not find any information on the package or on-line on what type of plastic was used to make this toy.  When companies make this claim I would like them to provide the information, which is the reason I gave this a 4 star rating vs. a 5 star.

I thought she was maybe a little old but since it was what they each specifically asked for, the hunt began. After reading about many of the other kits available this was the one I decided on and it's perfect! She had loved it for almost a year now. A couple weeks ago she even used the name tag for when dressing up for career day at school as a dentist. She plays 'doctor"" and ""hospital"" and ""vet"" with their stuffed animals all the time. They've even added a cute disney face mask they got at the real hospital this past summer to their kit. So great for imaginary play, educational too. The only thing I would change is the blood pressure cuff being able to fit an adult better. She likes to take my blood pressure but it won't fit on my arm and stay we put it on my wrist just fine but seems like it would be easy to have it be a little bigger so kids could fit it on anything from a stuffed animal to a parent. :)

 Its easier to use than the Retaliator and fires more quickly
 Its easy to cock and makes a great cocking sound (I guess this is important to boys)

Great toy!",Nerf Doomlands Double Dealer Blaster.,False,
B018KLHWVK,4.0,"Pros

It shoots two darts at once, I think that's pretty awesome.

Aesthetically pleasing.  Really wild and futuristic, like something from Mad Max.

It comes with two twelve dart clips.

It is a slam fire weapon meaning you can hold down the trigger while pulling back the firing mechanism in the front.  It seems really aggressive until you realize that you are just firing tiny orange darts.

The darts fire a bit farther than your average nerf gun, especially for a bigger gun like this Double Dealer.

It has a clip storage space on the forward part of  the stock, it has space for two extra clips which would be super cool in a battle.

It is fairly accurate.

Pretty lighweight.

Cons

If you use the slam fire mechanism, the accuracy goes way down as there is no smooth and motionless way to shoot like this.

It tends to jam about a 25% of the time that you shoot.

It uses up darts really quickly if you use the slam fire function, so you really have to buy the two extra clips for the front.

During a Nerf battle, usually one dart is enough to take out someone so having the two darts at once is wasteful and overkill.",Nice new weapon,False,
B018KLHWVK,4.0,"This is the kind of dart gun you break out when things are starting to get out of control because as we all know, the only thing to do when things get out of control is to them even more out of control. This beast is something of a hybrid crossbow/shotgun deal with two twelve capacity clips combining to deliver twenty four precision shots that can be unleashed in well under ten seconds. The gun shoots two darts at a time and shoots in two different manners. You can either cock the gun and fire or hold down the trigger and cock repeatedly as fast as you can, unleashing all twenty four shots in a pretty short span of time although the latter method makes the gun a little more prone to jams, which are easily remedied. The aesthetics of the gun lay in a sort of post-apocalyptic setting. It's not as detailed as the Zombie dart guns Nerf has released but it's still pretty cool looking. It's not particularly heavy but little kids may find it hard to cock the gun back and forth. The stock of the gun also has the ability to hold two more clips for a total of forty eight shots at hand, so that's another reason this thing is such a beast.

If you like dart guns and enjoy playing with them, this could potentially be a sweet addition to your arsenal. It's big, it's mean and has the ability to end all arguments in the right setting.","Big, mean and lethal",False,
B018KLHWVK,5.0,"My son really loves this gun.  It has that crossbow look, but can fire from one or both magazines at once.  It's nice that the clips are clear so you can see when you're almost out - which will be quickly due to the slam-fire action.  That lets you hold the trigger down and keep pumping the gun to fire.  Also, since the magazines can fit in the stock of the gun, you can have a total of 4 magazines ready with you.  The action is smooth and it actually came with some different colored darts, which is pretty cool as well.",Great firepower!,False,
B018KLHWVK,5.0,"Over the years, we've amassed quite the Nerf arsenal.  If you've never had the pleasure of a family Nerf gun war, you don't know what you're missing!  When we had the opportunity to try out the Nerf Doomlands Double Dealer Blaster, my kids eagerly rose to the challenge.

My 11 year old has declared himself as the family Nerf expert and enthusiast.  He had no trouble getting this Nerf model out of the box and loaded up for play time.  The gun comes with 24 darts that are loaded into two 12 dart clips.  The clips are inserted on either side of the gun for a different sort of look than you see with most of these toys.  No batteries are needed -- the gun works with a pump action and shoots two darts at a time.  I haven't measured the range on the gun, but I can tell you that if I stand in the entryway to our home, I can shoot my husband on the far side of the living room (if he holds still--my aim is not the best).

This Nerf toy is a great addition to our collection.  Lots of fun to shoot, big but lightweight.  The only drawback in a battle is the time it takes to reload both clips.  I'd suggest having a backup Nerf weapon to compensate for the time needed to reload this one.  Or, do what I do and force everyone to let you be on a team with the best player (in this case, my husband) so you always win in spite of your bad aim.

So far we have not had any quality issues with this toy.  In general, we've been happy with the quality of Nerf dart guns overall and this toy seems to live up to the expectations we have for the brand.",Nerf Doomlands Double Dealer Blaster,False,2.0
B018KLHWVK,5.0,"This is the Nerf double dealer rifle. The action is similar to a pump shotgun. It fires two foam darts at a time.

Set up is very simple. Simply attach the two ports on both sides of the rifle  which snap right in. Next, load the darts into the magazine. Cock the mechanism back and push it forward, followed by pulling the trigger. The effective range is about 10 to 20 feet.

Beyond that range, the velocity rapidly decreases. Because of the pump action, this rifle is a two handed operation.  Within the buttstock, the user can store both magazines. However, it is more fun to keep the magazines in the forward position. The magazine capacity is 12 darts. You are provided with 24 darts.  Loading the magazine is very easy but you have to be careful not to bend the darts. The mechanism of the magazine is very smooth, and there is virtually no resistance.  Each magazine has a clear window so you can tell the capacity that is already loaded.

The item is solid in construction and is very durable. Reliability of the magazine feeding is excellent as long as the darts are not deformed or bent.  If the mechanism jams, there is a jam clearing door at the top of the rifle.

The bright colors are stylish making this a safe and fun toy. Since the velocity is fairly high within the effective range, it is not a good idea to aim at somebody's face or at fragile objects around the house.

This toy is a lot of fun .

Lots of comments/reviews on Amazon said that the plug leaked a lot ... I was worried about that, but ordered it anyway because lots of people had no complaints. When we put the table together, our inclination was to insert the plug from the underside of the table and it seemed to fit fine, but when we filled it with water the water came pouring out of the plug fast enough to empty the table within a minute or so. We soon realized we had the plug in upside down! Be sure to insert the plug while the table is upright on it's legs then push the plug in until it ""snaps"" into place. No more leak!

B0193MPOAQ,5.0,"My girls LOVE this table!  We bought it last week in anticipation of the heat wave we were going to have and they had a blast with it.  Let me start off by saying that yes, the plug is difficult to install in the bottom.  There are two rings on it and you have to push VERY hard to get it to seal all the way around properly.  If it isn't flush with the bottom, then it is not installed all the way and it will leak.  I had one small side that didn't want to go down at first and it look a lot of force to get it in there but once it was then I had no leaking problems at all.  And you can still pull up the actual plug very easily afterwards to drain the table out.  The table itself it really nice too, the little spring board on the side is great to bounce the characters in and the 'swirl' crank gets the water turning really fast.  Note that there are a few different versions out there... the one at Kohls doesn't have a slide but comes with another character and the coffee pot and the Toys R Us version has a taller tower but the slide is narrower.  I liked this one because the slide is nice and wide and the characters go down it pretty easy.

Either way, they will finally end up with the gargantuan 3-foot long creature that moves, shakes, coos, farts, giggles and growls thanks to a programmable brain.

This kit is a big step up from Meccanos&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Micronoid/dp/B019HP2AKG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Micronoid</a>&nbsp;line for ages 8+ and which features less than 200 parts. At 10+, this T-Rex has more than 750 parts and requires building the dinosaur frame around the centrally located heavy battery pack (acts both as the power source and the T-Rexs ballast-like torso), proper positioning of the LED eyes, and connecting the ports for the eyes, battery and programmable unit via cables.

The fun in this project for the 10+ age range is the building challenge itself. Seeing the assembled nuts and bolts come spectacularly to life was thrilling and gave my son a real sense of accomplishment. One challenge: when in attack mode, the T-Rex did a face plant. The forward movement and weight could not be supported. Using his STEAM knowledge, my son corrected that imbalance by simply extending the 16 tail another 7 with repurposed parts.

I blew up the float, just to make sure everything was advertised and working properly. No issues. It didn't take long to blow it up at all. The cool thing about this is that it doubles as a lay on raft. So if the beer pong goes extremely terrible, your not entirely out of your money and do have a decent sized raft to lay on. The plastic is very thick and well made. I think it will be able to withstand a drinking activity. It comes with 28 spots for cups. 10 on each side for the rack and 4 on each side to hold the wash cups or for people to store their drinks. The holes for the cups are pretty deep and the cups stay in well (standard solo cup). It also comes with 5 balls.

The version that me and my friends play is with water in the cups and just a drink in hand. So the extra cup holders can hold some beers and we won't have to worry about excess beer spilling all into the pool like some people were worried about. They make portable plastic cups that look like beer or soda cans but the tab opens and closes to make it waterproof aka pool friendly. I would suggest getting those with this, and then its a perfect pool party game! Overall I am super happy with this and can't wait to try it in the water.

B019PC59SG,5.0,"It's been about a week now. The swan raft (It's literally a raft. This thing is huge!) Takes up half of my living room. It's crazy!
1. Comes with written/picture instructions. Separate email from purchase order came in from seller, offering suggestions/care instructions to pump and raft. Pretty self explanatory with JUST the manual instructions themselves, so I'm very appreciative about the extra instructions.
2. Pump included with three different nozzle inserts. I've utilized them all, but to be honest, you would only need to use two of them. They blow in to the raft just the same. Batteries were NOT included. To be expected. 4 D batteries needed. I suggest purchasing good quality batteries. It'll get the job done regardless of what batteries you use. But the pump is good for blowing other floaters/rafts up just as well.
3. Swan blew up perfectly and effortlessly. The only thing I would ""complain"" about, would be the neck of the swan. No matter how long or how hard I manually blow in to the tube of the neck, or use the pump, it will not get as stiff as the rest of the raft. There aren't any holes or leaks through the edges (because it's been about a week. The raft is in the same condition as when I first filled the entire thing) but it will not expand fully like the wings or the raft itself. Not a huge problem and not a small one either. Just something to point out regardless.
4. Rope line included. There are two loop holes on each side of the swan (beneath the sides of the neck area). I just tied each end of the rope on to the loops. Acts as a strap (for now). There's no near by lakes in the central area of where I'm from and the community pool did not allow us to take this in (too big and obnoxious I guess). But they just hate us cuz they aint us (The Interview reference).
5. Overall, I would definitely recommend this raft to ANYONE! It's very ""Kardashian"" for sure. It's solid, holds up well, and is quite strong. I have a five year old that uses it as a trampoline (he's around 40ish pounds) it's still in good shape after all the torture my son put this swan through. Actually, in perfect shape. Blowing the entire thing up was easy. Ten minutes, TOPS! Deflating it, however,.... Whole different story.. (I'm not planning on telling it anytime soon.)

B019PC59SG,5.0,"I purchased this Inflatable beer pong table to use in my swimming pool to replace my previous one that had a few fatal design flaws.  I'm still a few weeks away from opening my pool for the season but I can already tell that this one is a major upgrade.  The first and maybe my favorite feature where it excels is the valve.  The valve has a very wide 2 part opening that allows for super quick filling.  Similar to a Boston valve but on this one, the 1st part presses in instead of screwing.  This 1st part is a 1 way valve so no worries about air leaking out when you pull away your pump and insert the 2nd, top part.  I definitely recommend using an electric pump.  I used my Intex quick fill and inflated the raft in under 20 seconds!  The raft has only 1 air chamber...another improvement vs my old one which had 3 and took unnecessarily long to fill.  The vinyl is heavy duty and it's large, and more importantly wide size makes this double as the perfect floatie for even larger adults.  The distance in the middle between the 2 teams' cups is shorter than it would be on a standard table.  That's ok though because 1. I'm terrible at beer pong and 2.

They came in a variety of colors--so note that they come randomly assorted. They would work well for party favors or having multiples if your kid is hard on toys. They are adorable in action--go around in circles and flip over. The only con is that when they flip to the side with the wind up on it, it gets stuck upside down like a turtle on it's shell. But when it works, it works.

They are also a bit cheaply made--paint is a little off--I wish there was more attention to detail with the finishings. But, overall they are cute and work well. My girls love them and ask for the ladybugs often.

For this scenario, I like being able to buy multiples at a reasonable cost.  When I opened the package, I was quite surprised at how large they are; I am quite pleased.  I received six ladybugs in five different colors.

Of course I had to test each one to make sure all of them worked.  I guess I did not read the description too well.  I expected the bug to just race in one straight path until it ran out of juice.  I swear I giggled when the first one started to scoot along but then it started to spin and them is flipped over and then scoot in the opposite direction.  As a side note, every one of them worked.

I feel that these are well made. The key was easy to turn to wind it up. The bug actually had a little weight to it, not like a lot of the wind- up toys that I have seen.  The markings on each bug are adorable.  There are antennas on the front of each bug.  They do not stick out so I do not think they would be easy to break off in normal play. But because they are attached to the bug, not painted, I would not let young children play with them as those little fingers might try to break them off and put them in their mouths.

The toys come in packaged in a nice zipper close bag.  I am very pleased with my purchase.  I plan to look at other items by Toy Cubby for my baskets.

The Motorcycle just looks and feels like a pointless pack in. Something that nobody wants or wanted, but they had to bundle in in order to get the point across about the new movie. It's oversized, cluttered and ugly. You will display the three cadilacs. Ecto-1, 1A and the new one. This thing will get dumped in a drawer.

There are a few lights and sounds.  The one issue I have, and this might sound kind of silly, but is the name.

Folded up, it will hold up to 9 dresses and lots of bows and shoes.  Included are 4 colorful dresses, 2 bows and 2 pairs of shoes.

The one drawback is that there is only one figure to dress. A second character would greatly improve the play value.",The boutique features a nice array of outfits for Minnie Mouse to wear,False,
B01ASVD5QQ,5.0,"My 3 year old daughter loves Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, especially Minnie Mouse. She was super excited when she saw me opening this box and hasn't stopped playing with it since.

It was easy to get out of the packaging and put together. The dresses snap onto Minnie and onto the clothing display easily. The bows sort of hold onto Minnie's ears, more securely than they look like they would. The shoes easily pop on and off her feet.

There is a band that you can wrap around Minnie to keep her attached to the case. This is a wonderful addition to the product, as my daughter makes sure Minnie is strapped in tight after each time she plays with it. No missing key piece like we usually have with other toys.

The handle is wonderful as well. It's easy for my daughter to carry this from room to room and even up and down the stairs.

The lights and sounds are a fun little addition, but the outfits are what make the toy. I was a bit disappointed that it came with 4 dressed but only 2 bows and 2 shoes, when there is clearly room for more of everything. Apparently, you can buy  more separately. I usually don't buy extra outfits and things for my kids toys, but I may make an exception for this one.

B01ASVD5QQ,5.0,"My two daughters, ages three and eight,  already have a couple of Minnie Mouse playsets, so this was a good fit for them and they were excited to try it out. This is by far our biggest Minnie set, and the coolest with the lights and music.

This Sparkle 'n Spin Fashion Bow-tique is basically a big closet for Minnie, with a storage space for her shoes and bows and nifty flipping doorways, operated by a bow-shaped slider, that showcase her snap-on dresses. The slider triggers lights and sounds. The set holds nine dresses and accessories,  which is great for anyone who has other Minnie sets like we do. Still, it also comes with four dresses, two bows, and two shoes. Kudos to Disney for including a few options without forcing folks to add on separate purchases. You can a surprising amount of creative play with just the accessories included here.

At first glance, despite being big and bright and musical, this may look like a carrying case more than a playset. Although it certainly has a handle and closes up nicely, my kids have not treated this like a case. This, for them, is a fun fashion dress-up set, and they just love to ""browse"" the options on view and snap clothes onto Minnie. If you have extra sets with bows and dresses, more options just equal more fun. It's nice to see my kids playing creatively with a toy together.

With this set, there it is very convenient to store these toys when not in use.  They also easily dry up so this is hygienic for there will be no mildew build up.  I also like the size of these toys which is not a choking hazard and because of their size, they can easily be gripped and grabbed by my son's little hands.  He absolutely loves playing with them and trying to squeak them.  The colors are very attractive and the different characters are indeed very much educational.  Even though he cannot really talk yet, we are already introducing to him the different names of the character toys and he is happy whenever we do that to him.  The toys are not hard which is good but it is not too soft as well.  It is actually just right.  Overall, this is such a very worthy purchase of your money.

The 6 animals are:

* are PVC and BPA free
* are soft and colorful
* float in water
* squirt water from their mouths
* help with hand/eye coordination
* come with a bonus mesh bag with suction cups for storage

These are the grandkids favorite bath toy now. They can squirt water and pretend play with them. They've also asked to take them outside to play with them in the plastic pool. These colorful sea creatures will be getting a lot of use at grandma's house!

B01FVZ386Q,5.0,"Today is Star Wars Celebration Day and we just got to see the teaser trailer for Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi, so I'm stoked and in full on Star Wars mode. Finally being able to get my hands on former Guardian of the Whills Baze Malbus is kinda the icing on the cake. I wasn't happy just having Chirrut all by himself, ya kinda need them both, like R2 and Threepio. Unfortunately this figure is still higher in price than I'd like ($30ish) but ultimately worth it.

My one and only real complaint for this figure is, he's difficult to stand, like annoyingly so. Granted a large part of that is due to Baze's MWC-35c Staccato Lightning repeating cannon and the power cell backpack. It adds weight to the figure and throws off the balance, but with a little patience you'll be able to pose him. The sculpt here is great, the figure is covered in detail, the head sculpt looks convincingly like Wen Jiang who played Baze Malbus in Rogue One, they even have the scar on his face like in the film, which is great. Baze comes loaded with gear, articulation functions well and the paint applications help bring the figure to life. Overall this figure is worth getting, especially if you're a big fan of Rogue One, which I am.

The repeating canon fits well in his hands, looks natural in a two hand pose. The Galven-circuitry flexible charge belt pegs into the bottom of the canon, as well as pegs into the bottom of the backpack cooling power cell. The backpack itself pegs into Baze's back, and I like that they included his dust shroud on the pack. I'm ok with Hasbro doing this in plastic, though I'd have preferred if they had uses soft goods for the dust shroud but it's fine as is. The flexible charge belt actually is flexible so it's nice that is actually functions the way it should. Baze also comes with his taser that fits well in either hand, and also has a nice spot to peg into the back of his belt.

This figure is great, I really wanted to get Baze because he and Chirrut were one of my favorite parts about Rogue One, and Hasbro did a great job executing the figure. It's a bit of a bummer he's so hard to stand, for display options I fear he'll be a shelf diver. Aside from that issue, this figure is a must have for your Black Series collection. Paint apps are solid, there's nice highlights and weathering and a good dirty wash all over his flight suit. The accessories have nice sculpt detailing and paint, and I like that they peg in easily. Articulation is good, arms and legs work well, the torso movement isn't the best, and the backpack cooling power cell makes him even harder to balance, but that barely detracts from this otherwise fantastic figure. Baze Malbus may have given up his faith in the force, but the force of Hasbro was strong with him on this release, this figure comes FULLY APPROVED.",Hasbro's Star Wars Black Series Baze Malbus,True,2.0

B01H7H542M,5.0,"This review is for the Universal Specialties Liquid Motion Timer.

This is a really fun lava style toy like the ones I had when I was a child. I haven't seen something like this for years, so when I saw it being offered I knew I had to purchase it and try it out. Its ashame you cannot select the color you want  the color just comes random. I received the green and turquoise blend. It is very pretty but if I was purchasing these for multiple children  I would want different ones and this listing doesnt allow me to do that.

The timer is fairly large, about the size of a full hand. I believe it measures in at about six inches by two inches. It is also very light. I love having stuff like this around. It is so soothing to stare at  I set this next to my computer screen and turn it over constantly. It doesnt last long  the liquid empties out in approximately a minute or so, but I guess this is a timer. The liquid emptied out at different rates as I turned it back and forth though, so I don't know how accurate it is for actual timing stuff.

The liquid is maybe an oil consistency and very fluid. Its pretty how there are two colors flowing together. It looks best if you hold it against a glass window. I tried to photograph it so you can get an idea. The actual unit itself is fairly smooth acrylic and flattish. I like this because its not bulky and I can carry it with me places to view the fun. Overall, a nice little toy for all ages and genders. 5/5 stars

B00ASKV6XC,5.0,"This item arrived quickly and was packaged well, as is the case normally for Amazon deliveries to me.

This is a very quick build.  About 10 minutes for me, from opening the box to cleaning up the table.  It's a fun build, however.

The packaging is really nice. It's not just a little box, it's actually like a flip open case that locks closed with some plastic inserts. I normally just throw little boxes away, but I'll be keeping this one and setting it behind the Jellyfish on my shelf. It would come in handy if I ever had to take it apart for any reason to store it myself.

The base of the Jellyfish has a light in it that works in a really nifty way. You squeeze the two lower sides of the ""Delta Shield"" and that activates the light that makes the blue part of the base glow.

This is a model of the ship that Spock traveled back in time in the 2009 ""Star Trek"" film.  It may not be familiar to Trek fans of old, and I think that the only time it's been seen is in that 2009 film.  The back half of the model spins around, just like the one in the movie did.

Like I said, it's a really quick build, but I think it's a fun build and the end product is pretty cool.",Nice Little Quickly Built Model...,True,2.0

I was confused on the domino game when we first opened it, just know they are not real dominoes. They are cardboard squares. I didn't like that, however my daughter knew no difference.

My only complaint and reason for giving it 4 stars is that the storage box is poorly made and if you're not careful to make sure/teach your daughter how to put it away properly...all the pieces can easily get mixed up or lost.
